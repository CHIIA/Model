LP  Melbourne is catching the eye of major Asian companies, with  China  Poly  Group  entering the market in a $20

million  venture, while CIMB TrustCapital is eyeing a CBD office building worth about $90m.

The CIMB and TrustCapital Advisors venture is believed to be the  lead  contender for the 16-level office tower at
575 Bourke Street, with the  sale  expected to be the biggest in Melbourne so far this year and likely to show a
fully let yield of about 7 per cent.

TD  The  company  declined to comment but sources identified the  group  as the  lead  bidder.

The building is being  sold  by a fund managed by Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management.

Agents on the deal, Colliers International’s Nick Rathgeber and Leigh Melbourne and CBRE’s Mark Coster, Luke
Etherington and Richard Butler, declined to comment.

Elsewhere, the Shanghai-listed arm of Poly, Poly Real  Estate , has swept into the Melbourne  apartment
market, inking a joint venture agreement for a project in up-market South Yarra.

The  group  said it had made a $19.8m  site purchase  by striking up a joint venture. It said it had bought a 51
per cent  stake  in a project, believed to be in Claremont Street. It said it was planning a development with floor
space of 36,268sq  m  on the more than 2000sq  m site .CBRE senior director Mark Wizel said the latest deal
showed there was lots of room left for growth in Melbourne’s  apartment  market.
