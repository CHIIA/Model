LP  Qube gets set to lob a counter bid for Asciano, while GE Capital wraps up its hasty exit from Australia.

The fight for Asciano appears far from a foregone conclusion as a new bid is expected to roll in today.

TD  Elsewhere, Santos bows to pressure and taps investors for cash, GE Capital completes its Australian exit and

the IPO of McGrath Estate Agents receives a strong reception from fund managers.

A change to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners’ $8.9 billion bid for control of Asciano -- which delivers success
with just 50.1 per cent acceptance -- has failed to deter potential rival suitor Qube , which is poised to deliver its
first takeover offer.

The ASX-listed Qube, which teamed with CPPIB and GIP to claim 20 per cent of Asciano last week, will likely
deliver [http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/10/mergers-acquisitions/qube-pitch-rival-bid-
asciano] its counter-proposal today as Asciano execs prepare to present to shareholders at its AGM. Qube is
desperate to get its hands on the Patrick ports operation within Asciano, while its JV partners are keen to snare
the rail assets.

Meanwhile, Santos has pulled the trigger on a host of initiatives that will deliver $3.5bn to the embattled group.
The action [http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/9/resources-and-energy/santos-unveils-35bn-
capital-boost] includes a $2.5bn rights issue to existing shareholders as well as the $520 million sale of a 35 per
cent stake in the Kipper gas field to Mitsui and a controversial
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/10/equity-capital-markets/questions-over-honys-true-intent]
$500m placement to China’s Hony Capital .

The latter element of the capital raising plan comes at a 15 per cent premium to its last traded price, with Hony
to secure a 7.9 per cent stake in the process. However, the move has reportedly forced suitor Scepter Partners
to walk away from a bid and ensured a sharp reduction in the chances of a takeover in coming months.

In finance, the remainder of GE Capital’s Australian operations has been hived off
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/9/mergers-acquisitions/ge-sell-aust-commercial-lending-
business] to Sankaty Advisors through a $1.9bn deal. The sale of the commercial lending operation rounds off a
rapid exit for GE from the local financial sector.

Deutsche Bank was the key funder of the Sankaty purchase having earlier been spruiked as a joint venture
partner with the winning bidder. It is believed, however, that the German outfit will still receive a small slice of the
loans. Sankaty edged out Lone Star Funds on the deal.

In the IPO market, the float of McGrath Estate Agents may be accelerated
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/10/equity-capital-markets/mcgrath-big-draw] owing to
strong demand. A bookbuild slated to raise upwards of $121m has been brought forward two days to today,
while the listing date of December 9 may also be tweaked. The firm is set to secure a valuation between $254m
and $296m.

Fellow IPO candidate Wellard Group is also on track for a successful pre-Christmas float, pricing its shares to
deliver a valuation as high as $672m. The cattle exporter will raise close to $400m through the deal.

Elsewhere, ASX-listed Reckon is weighing a split and consequent sell-off of its operations. The accounting
software maker could draw interest for its SME accounting unit from US-based Intuit , while MYOB may be a
suitor for its APS practice management software arm, according to The Australian Financial Review.
