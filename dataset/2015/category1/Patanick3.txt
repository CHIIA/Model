LP  FALLEN  coal billionaire  Nathan Tinkler has been hired by a junior  mining company  to serve as a corporate

adviser.

Nickel explorer Rumble Resources yesterday announced it had secured the services of Australia’s one-time
youngest  billionaire  who will be paid in performance share options.

TD  The deal, potentially worth more than $4.5  million , means Mr Tinkler only gets paid if Rumble’s share price rises

above certain thresholds.

The 38-year-old is eligible to receive 27  million  share options, with 7  million  priced at 8¢ each and two 10  million
parcels priced at 15¢ and 25¢ each.

Rumble shares surged 40 per cent yesterday to close at 7.7¢, taking its market value to close to $12  million  and
leaving Mr Tinkler just shy of his first strike price.

Mr Tinkler said Rumble’s holdings in Western Australia’s Fraser Range area “could well be a world-class nickel
province in the making”.

“Rumble represents one of the best opportunities in the area and ticks all the boxes,” he said in a statement.

Rumble chief Shane Sikora said Mr Tinkler brought a wealth of experience in developing resource projects and
structuring finance deals, as well as an extensive business network throughout Asia.

“The value creation that will come from Nathan’s involvement will be transformational for Rumble as he is
incentivised to grow the value of Rumble substantially,” Mr Sikora said.

Singapore-based Mr Tinkler was worth more than $1.2  billion  at his peak but lost the bulk of his fortune – including
his near 20 per cent  stake  in Whitehaven  Coal  – when lenders called in their loans during the ongoing resources
downturn.

Mr Tinkler’s foray into nickel comes after he sold his Patinack Farm thoroughbred  operations  near Canungra in
2014 to a group of overseas and local buyers, in a deal believed to be worth between $100  million  and $130
million .

The move comes after Mr Tinkler paid $150  million  for a mothballed Queensland  coal  mine in May last year.

Tinkler’s entire racing and breeding properties on the  Gold  Coast were sold to  Hong Kong billionaire  Tony Fung
last month. The Aquis Group chairman bought all four Patinack Farm landholdings for an undisclosed amount.

Mr Fung plans to turn the 447ha holding into a five-star resort with golf course and equestrian facilities.

The racing facility was put on the market last year after retail giant and Magic  Millions  founder Gerry Harvey
ordered Tinkler to pay a debt believed to have peaked at about $60  million .

Mr Harvey picked up almost $34  million  after about 500 Patinack Farm horses went under the hammer at an
unreserved  sale  on the  Gold  Coast in September last year.

It is believed the Canungra  sale  fetched close to $20  million , which is less than the $21.05  million  Mr Tinkler
paid for the four properties in 2010 before pouring at least $7  million  into developing them.However he appears
likely to hold on to his Newcastle Jets A-league team which he has been trying to sell after buying it for $5  million
in 2010.
