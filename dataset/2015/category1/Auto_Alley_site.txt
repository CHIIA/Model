SITES: Interest in apartment sites in Sydney’s west is heating up, with local developer Dyldam and
Chinese giant Greenland Holding Group battling it out for the $150 million Auto Alley site in Parramatta.

Sources said the site — which can support a $600m development of nearly 800 apartments — has had
strong offers from two parties, with the property expected to be sold before the expressions of interest
campaign closes on March 19.

While sources said that Greenland was aggressively pursuing property, there are so far two higher
bidders, Dyldam and another Shanghai-based developer that is trying to make an entrance into Sydney.

Stockland chief executive Mark Steinert confirmed yesterday that the company paid $103.5m for a 51ha
site in Sydney’s northwest, opposite Schofields Train Station.

Stockland has the potential to develop 340 residential lots, 275 townhouses, 560 apartments and a
12,000sq m town centre with retail on the property. “This is an excellent strategic acquisition for
Stockland that increases our presence in the strongest, new residential growth precinct in Sydney and
expands our medium-density offering,” Mr Steinert said. “This development provides us with a second
active residential sales front in north west Sydney, complementing our highly successful Elara
community, which is under development at Marsden Park.” On the Auto Alley site in Parramatta,
family-owned Boyded Industries Group is selling the 14.8ha site, fronting 44-56 Phillip Street, after using
it as a car yard since the 1950s. It was rezoned in September and will hold up to 40,000sq m of
commercial space as well as the units. It will be part of the Parramatta Council’s push to change the car
dealing area to one with offices, retail and units.The parties and the agents on the deal, Colliers
International’s Guillaume Volz, Harry Bui and Ryan Bennetts, and Matrix Property Group’s Andrew
Antonas and John Chancellor, could not be contacted last night.
