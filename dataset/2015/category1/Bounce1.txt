LP  Hotels and backpacker hostels are the target of investors as they get a foothold into the improving tourism

sector.

Demand for the properties is also being fed by students who stay in the hotels while they find permanent
accommodation for their university studies.

TD  One recent deal was the  purchase  of Bounce Backpackers in Sydney's central business district by a private

Chinese  investor for $18.3 million.

It was the latest in a tranche of sub-$25 million  transactions  to offshore buyers.

The five-star Bounce Backpackers is a five-level  site  at 28 Chalmers Street with 190 beds over three levels, a
ground floor tavern/bar area and top floor featuring kitchen facilities and outdoor common areas.

CBRE Hotels' Andrew Jackson, who negotiated the  sale , said Australia's  hotel  sector continues to appeal to
Asian investors, with its relative proximity, economic stability and high growth returns.

"Offshore investors have been traditionally focused on five-star CBD  hotel assets , however, a lack of available
stock in the top end, coupled with a greater appreciation for the fundamentals Australia provides, has led to
increased appetite levels for mid-tier  assets ."

Mr Jackson said offshore investors are also looking beyond the traditional city-based hotels with a renewed
interest on the regional and suburban market, once dominated by the domestic investment community.

The lower Australian dollar has enticed inbound visitors leading to a rise in occupancy rates for hotels across all
sectors. In turn, investors are snapping up the bricks and mortar as well as the management.

According to agents there has been more than $2.5 billion in  transactions  completed in the first half of 2015,
the second largest  transaction  pipeline across the Asia Pacific region.

CBRE's 2015 Asia Pacific  Hotel  MarketView report shows Australia ranks second behind  Hong Kong  in terms
of  transaction  activity.
