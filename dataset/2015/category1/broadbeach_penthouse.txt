A LUXURY penthouse has sold for $8 million in Broadbeach – the Gold Coast’s biggest residential
sale this year.

A Chinese national bought the two-level apartment in the Oracle Broadbeach but will only spend a
portion of the year in the property.

It is expected to be unoccupied when the owner is out of the country. Set 50 and 51 floors above the
Oracle’s dining and shopping precinct, the 1117sq m penthouse features four bedrooms, media room,
study, and rooftop pool, spa and steam room.

It has 360-degree views of the coastline, ocean and Gold Coast Hinterland. The $8 million sale
smashed the beachfront suburb’s previous penthouse record set by Vogue on Broadbeach in 2010
when it was bought for $5.5 million; and trumps the precinct’s top house price of $5.8 million, in 2006
for a 75sq m dual-storey beachfront home in First Ave.

The Oracle sale comes after Hong Kong billionaire Tony Fung forked out $7 million for the Soul
penthouse in Surfers Paradise in May this year.KM Sales and Marketing agent Jayde Pezet said he
was delighted the Oracle penthouse had sold to a buyer from one of the company’s “international and
domestic networks”.
