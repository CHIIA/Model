Centuria Property Funds has sold two properties in Sydney's Macquarie Park, including 16 Byfield Street, for
$101 million Supplied

Unlisted property investment manager Centuria Property Funds has sold two
properties in Sydney's Macquarie Park to a local developer for $101 million.

The sale of the properties at 80 Waterloo Road and 16 Byﬁeld Street will soon be put to
a vote by investors, whose approval is necessary to conﬁrm the deal

The buyer is an experienced local development group, understood to be from
Melbourne and backed by a Chinese group, with a number of signiﬁcant projects in
Sydney and Melbourne already.

Centuria Property Funds, a subsidiary of the listed Centuria Capital, acquired the
properties in 2000 for $24 million after identifying the Macquarie Park area as one
that would beneﬁt from infrastructure developments such as the then-planned
Chatswood to Epping Rail Link and the expansion of the Macquarie Centre.

The deal represents a ﬁve-fold return on investment, Centuria said in a market
announcement late on Friday.

Expressions of Interest

"In recent years opening up of transport links, the growth of the business precinct and
the increasing density of Sydney's population have added signiﬁcantly to the amenity
and popularity of this area," said Centuria Unlisted Property Funds chief executive
Jason Huljich.

"The Macquarie Park ofﬁce precinct is now larger than the North Sydney ofﬁce
precinct. We strongly believed these factors would translate into strong rents and
demand for space.

"We saw a real medium-term opportunity to redevelop this large site for commercial
News
or residential use. In the interim, we kept it as fully-leased ofﬁce buildings providing a
strong income return for investors."

Opinion

Centuria put together a development scheme for 380 apartments on the site and then
offered it for sale through CBRE's Scott Gray-Spencer and Matthew Ramsay.

Mr Huljich said strong interest in the sales campaign and the purchase price had
vindicated Centuria's property management strategy.

The deal caps off a busy year for Centuria. Its recent transactions include a $104
million acquisition of three properties at the Australian Technology Park, where
Centuria was a co-tenderer alongside Mirvac.

internal rate of return for investors after only two years.

Centuria bought the 175 Castlereagh Street building in 2013 for $56 million. The sales
generate substantial performance fees to the Centuria group.
