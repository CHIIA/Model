LP  HONG Kong  billionaire Tony Fung will release plans in six weeks for development of what could be one of the

country’s biggest tourism sites, at Nathan Tinkler’s Patinack Farm.

The Aquis  Group  chairman (pictured) snapped up four parcels of land owned by Tinkler in the Gold Coast
Hinterland for $15 million last month, including Wadham  Park  (33.64ha), Elysian Fields (56.97ha), Saravale
(73.26ha) and Benobble (283.40ha).

TD  Mr Fung’s leading option was to consolidate the plots into a single “mega- site ” of 447.27ha, which would make any

tourism development more than 15 times larger than Australia Zoo (29ha).

The consolidated  site  was also more than 100ha larger than the  site  of Mr Fung’s $8.15 billion Aquis Great Barrier
Reef Resort, which he has planned for the Cairns region (spread over 340.6ha).

Troubled coal miner Tinkler put his Queensland Patinack Farm landholdings up for  sale  as four separate lots in
November after it failed to fetch more than $12 million at auction.

A spokesman for Mr Fung confirmed yesterday that all four Patinack Farm properties in the hinterland were settled
on the same day.

Records just released showed Mr Fung paid $700,000 more than Mr Tinkler did for Benobble, the largest of the four
sites, with the  sale  price set at $4.576 million on February 16 and payment settled on March 18.The smaller lots,
Wadham  Park  and Elysian Fields, were believed to be valued at more than the vacant land at Benobble. The $15
million Mr Fung paid was below the $21 million the market had speculated the properties would sell for.
