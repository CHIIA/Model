SOME SUBURBS HAVE ACHIEVED 30 PER CENT PRICE GROWTH OVER THE PAST YEAR, WRITES KATE
FARRELLY.

TD  The current financial year is on track to deliver a new record for the number of property sales above $5 million

on Sydney's upper north shore.

McGrath Lindfield agent Philip Waller says there have already been 11 $5 million-plus sales since July,
compared with seven in 2014-2015 and 12 in 2013-2014.

"With the slowdown in the low to mid-price ranges, the upper end was due to have its turn and that certainly
seems to be the case," Waller says. "The amount of sales between $4 and $5 million has also exploded and
there is still a good number of qualified buyers."

Waller says the Australian dollar is in "good territory" and enticing ex pats back into the market, and with
favourable visa conditions and a continuing good news story for interest rates, local upgraders and Chinese
buyers are still in the mix.

Matthew Bourn of McConnell Bourn is also finding the $5 million-plus market buoyant.

Fifteen bidders registered for the auction of 29a Bobbin Head Road, Pymble last month and the property sold
"significantly above reserve" for $7.05 million. A local Chinese family were the successful bidders of the six-
bedroom estate, with tennis court and pool.

Domain Group senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson says Sydney's prestige property market has stepped up a
gear this year with higher volumes of sales and rising confidence from buyers and sellers. This follows a period
of subdued activity with prices growth set to follow the increase in sales.

"Although Sydney's inner suburban areas have been a significant focus of prestige buyers, leafy suburbs in the
upper north shore have benefited from strong changeover buyer activity," Wilson says.

"The best performers of this group have been Roseville, Gordon, Lindfield and Pymble. Each of these suburbs
has reported prices growth above 30 per cent over the past year with current medians well clear of $2 million."

One of our featured properties, Killara's Ballernoo, is in the running to secure a record price for the area. Sydney
Sotheby's agent Michael King is expecting the Federation mansion to sell well above the current Killara record of
$11.5 million, set in 2012 with the sale of a Springdale Road property. This sale matched the upper north shore
record set with the $11.5 million sale of 27-29 Chilton Parade, Warrawee late in 2010.
