LP  A 310-HECTARE Gippsland  dairy  farm has been  sold  to  Chinese  investors for more than $8  million

Notman's  Dairy , Poowong, is listed as having been  sold  for $8.1m, equating to $9000 per acre.

TD  Agent John Rowe, Harcourts Warragul, said he had another three or four similar-sized properties on the books

at the moment.

"There was some good interest in Notmans," Mr Rowe said.

"We had a lot of inquiries, both local and international.

"They were all looking at it as an investment not to run it themselves but to keep the manager on."

The property had been on Harcourts' books for about eight months, with a significant length of time having been
taken for the completion of "due diligence" by the new owners.

"I was told the due diligence could be three to six months and it was every bit of that," Mr Rowe said.

The property was marketed as one of Australia's premium dairies.

"The property is located in Poowong in what is considered some of the most highly reliable natural rainfall
regions in Australia," Mr Rowe said.

"The farm includes a fully structured and documented plan, along with a highly skilled management team that is
capable of continuing the high level of management of the  business ," he said.

Gippsland properties were being sought due to their proximity to Melbourne and reliability of rainfall.

"There is a window of opportunity, with better  milk  prices and low interest rates, and some of the smarter guys
have woken up to that," Mr Rowe said.

Major processors in the area include Burra Foods, Longwarry  Milk  Park, Murray Goulburn and Fonterra.

The property is fenced into 50 paddocks with all-weather laneways and is milking 550 cows.

A 40-stand rotary  dairy  with automated  milk  meters, cup removers and teat sprays are part of the
infrastructure.

Former owner Peter Notman said he still had a farm running a herd of 1000 cows in NSW.

"We don't have any of our three children taking over farming so we thought it better to have 1000 cows than
1600," Mr Notman said.

He said interest was being shown in the Gippsland area because of the reliable rainfall which ensured good
pasture growth.

"There were a couple of organisations which showed an interest and this  group  had shown a fair bit of interest
for a period of time," Mr Notman said.
