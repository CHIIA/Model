Chinese investment vehicle, Hengyi, has made another foray into the
Melbourne property market, emerging as the buyer of the Abbotsford
headquarters of Carlton & United Breweries.

Hengyi has paid more than  $20 million for the office building and
warehouses adjacent to CUB's nine-hectare brewery on the Yarra
River.

2-6 Southampton Crescent was built in 1928 for Kodak. 

The curved five-storey office building at 2-6 Southampton Crescent,
built in 1928 for Kodak returns $2.2 million a year in rent.

The acquisition includes a vacant warehouse at 36 Bond Street and
another complex of warehouses at 10-32 Duke Street, which is on
2404 square metres and returns $516,286 a year.

Their leases expire in December 2017. The buildings were part of a
portfolio sale and leaseback deal struck in 2007. Charter Hall and the
Wyllie Group paid $41 million for 10 properties on two hectares
around the Abbotsford brewery.

After the sale of parts of the portfolio, the Wyllie Group paid $18.3
million in 2009 to become the sole owner of the remaining
properties.

Carbone, who confirmed the sale but declined more information.

The high-yielding investment is expected to be a long-term hold for
Hengyi, who will re-lease the space after CUB moves out.

The area has a special zoning underpinned by the Abbotsford brewery.
Although CUB has stressed it has no plans to close the brewery, its
eventual closure will lead to a rezoning of the area and redevelopment
of the surrounding buildings.

Hengyi's other projects include the development of the long-
abandoned 199 William Street tower in the CBD into a 500-plus
apartment complex and the 69-level Light House tower overlooking
Queen Victoria Market.
