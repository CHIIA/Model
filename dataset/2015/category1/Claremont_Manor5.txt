LP  Major  Chinese  developers are spreading their wings outside of the bubbling Sydney market, with  China  Poly

Group  buying a project in Melbourne while Ridong has expanded its  Gold  Coast holdings.

In Melbourne, Poly has brought a  stake  in the Claremont Manor  apartment  project in South Yarra after
investing nearly $20  million . It is believed the Shanghai listed part of the  company , Poly Real  Estate , will
develop the 318- apartment  project with another  Chinese -backed  group , Southbank Developments. Poly
entered the local market last year with the $110m  purchase  of an industrial  park  off Goodman  Group .

TD  On the  Gold  Coast, industry sources said  billionaire  Riyu Li, who heads up  Chinese  development  company

Ridong  Group , was involved in the  purchase  of the Surfers Royale building.

While those close to the deal remain tight-lipped, it is understood Mr Li is planning to eventually replace the
Surfers Royale with a new “luxury  residential ” development. “The intention of the  purchaser  is to hold on to
the existing asset for the short-term … and when market conditions  mature, they’re going to redevelop the  site
for luxury  residential ,” one source said. “It would be an  apartment  building pitched at the high end of the
market.” More than $21m is understood to have been outlaid to secure the 2251sq  m site  in Surfers Paradise,
where “ sold ” signs have been displayed in recent weeks.Ridong and their development counterparts Dalian
Wanda  Group  are jointly behind the $1  billion  Jewel project set to target the Glitter Strip’s top end. Mr Li has
been busy in the  Gold  Coast market in the past 18 months, with a $6.2m Tallebudgera mansion among his
purchases .
