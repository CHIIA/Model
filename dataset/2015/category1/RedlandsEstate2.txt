LP  RENOWNED Derwent Valley property Redland Estate has been sold, with the whisky distillery to move to a new

premises in coming months.

The 1819 estate at Plenty, which had housed the whisky distillery for the past eight years, was put on the market
in March, with the sale finalised last week.

TD  While the buyer and price for the property was unknown, it received significant interest from China, with reports

the property could fetch as much as $4 million.

Redlands Distillery had been closed to the public since Monday and it announced on its website that it would be
relocating due to the company “outgrowing our space” at the property.

The company is expected to release further plans of the relocation later this week.

Derwent Valley Mayor Martyn Evans said it was expected the distillery would remain within the municipality.

“We’re having negotiations at the moment and they’re actually actively looking to set up in the Derwent Valley so
there is no fear of losing the distillery out of the area,” he told the Gazette. “They’re working on a site within the
Derwent Valley to create that whiskey experience in another location.

“That’s a good thing for us to keep that brand and the paddock-to-the-bottle basic program going.” Cr Evans said
he was excited about the sale of Redlands and the potential tourism impact it could bring to the Valley through
the new buyers.

“We’re looking to talk to the new owners about their plans for the site because it’s a wonderful piece of heritage
that is also an amazing agricultural site,” he said.“The opportunity is there. So we’d love to set up a meeting with
the new owners and see where we can assist and work together to create a vision for the future of that site and
add visitation to the Valley.”
