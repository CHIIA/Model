There is strong Chinese appetite for Australian rural property Tamara Voninski

by Matthew Cranston
One of China's top 500 companies Hailiang Group has contracted to buy more than
$40 million worth of cattle and cropping land east of St George in southern
Queensland.

The conglomerate is controlled by Feng Hailiang, China's 90th richest man according
to Forbes, and has interests across mining, real estate, agriculture and education.

The Group, which outlayed $34 million for a residential development site at
Campsie in south-west Sydney in January, has agreed in principle to purchase about
50,000 hectares spread across two stations.

Last year another Chinese group, Orient Agriculture, emerged as the buyer of south-
west Queensland cropping property Undabri, about 120 kilometres away from the two
properties, for $30 million.

The transactions very clearly reﬂect China's growing appetite for farmland and its
ability to feed its massive population into the future.

However, the transactions also come at a time when the federal government is
enforcing greater transparency on foreign ownership of farmland.

Last week, the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Treasurer Joe Hockey and agricultural
minister Barnaby Joyce announced it would tighten the rules on foreign purchases of
agricultural land by lowering the screening threshold which foreign investors must
obtain approval for purchases to $15 million. They also said a foreign ownership
register of agricultural land would be created with the help of the Australian Tax
Ofﬁce.

Under current law, foreign groups seeking to acquire an agribusiness or agricultural
land require Foreign Investment Review Board approval if the value of the assets
being acquired exceeds $252 million.

There have been polarising views on this issue.
