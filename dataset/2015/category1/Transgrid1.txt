LP  Chinese companies bidding for the $9 billion NSW electricity transmission network will be prevented from having

any staff in management positions, and directors will require a security clearance, as part of strict conditions
placed on the sale.

As final bids for TransGrid are due at the end of this month, The Australian Financial Review has confirmed the
imposition of tough national security requirements for foreign bidders.

TD  These include a majority of local directors for the privatised TransGrid, security checks for directors being

nominated and restrictions on foreigners in management positions.

A NSW government source said "Australian oversight and management" would be required by the Foreign
Investment Review Board.

"It's also logical security clearances would be required for such an asset," said the person, who asked not to be
named.

The sale of TransGrid has been a politically sensitive topic in NSW given the interest from Chinese state-owned
bidders and a general perception that Beijing uses commercial enterprises to pursue its broader national
security agenda.

The Chinese government-owned State Grid is bidding as a part of a consortium which includes Macquarie
Infrastructure and Real Assets.

The consortium is favoured to win the auction.

The sensitivity around the sale is because of TransGrid's central role in the national electricity grid and its
ownership of a fibre optic network that is used by data centres in Canberra, which count the federal government
as a client.

Such is the secrecy surrounding these centres, even their location is considered classified.

In addition, TransGrid is at the core of the national electricity network, providing the back-up power supply for
the whole grid which comes through the Snowy Hydro scheme.

NSW Premier Mike Baird said the Foreign Investment Review Board would consider the national security and
foreign ownership issues surrounding the sale.

"My position in relationship to foreign ownership is that it is a matter which needs to be nationally consistent and
nationally considered and the body that does that in terms of ownership and security concerns is the Foreign
Investment Review Board," Mr Baird said during a visit to Shanghai on Friday.

"Any foreign bidder must clear the FIRB process."

Mr Baird stressed that the conditions on bidders were yet to be finalised.

The planned sale of NSW's electricity assets flared as an issue during the state election in March, when the
Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union ran an advertising campaign against Chinese ownership.

The Baird government slammed the CFMEU's campaign as "xenophobic" and a "racist rant", which would make
it harder to attract investors.

The opposition also questioned why NSW Treasurer Andrew Constance had held meetings with State Grid in
the lead-up to the assets being put on the market.

State Grid has been making investments over the world in recent years, as it looks to have 20 per cent of its
assets outside China by 2020.

State Grid's first Australian investment came in November 2012 when it paid $500 million for a 41 per cent stake
in South Australian transmission company ElectraNet.

That deal required FIRB approval and State Grid emerged with four of the nine board seats at ElectraNet.

State Grid also has minority shareholdings in gas and electricity distributors in Victoria and NSW.

Chinese ownership of strategic Australian assets became an issue again last month when the Port of Darwin
was sold to Chinese company Landbridge for $506 million.

Peter Jennings, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, questioned the sale to a Chinese company, given
the port's central role in the defence infrastructure of northern Australia.

"I think there is reason to be concerned about this sale and really the question that needs to be asked is, what
assessment of national security implications was made before the sale was agreed," he said.

Geoff Wade, from the Australian National University, pointed out that though Landbridge was a private company,
it had intimate links to the Communist Party.

Key points

Chinese ownership of strategic assets has raised security concerns.

The CFMEU campaigned against the NSW assets sale.
