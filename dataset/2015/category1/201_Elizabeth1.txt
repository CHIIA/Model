LP  Listed office giant Dexus  Property Group  has  sold  a suburban Sydney office building earmarked for

apartments for $95 million, reaping a 44 per cent premium to its book value as the  residential  building boom
rolls on.

Acquisitive family development  company  Holdmark  Property Group purchased  the inner-western building, at
36 George Street in Burwood.

TD  Dexus  Property Group  chief executive Darren Steinberg has led a strategy that has seen it capitalise on local
and offshore demand for  apartment  sites as it moves to unlock $1 billion worth of capital through the  sale  of
ageing  commercial  properties.

Dexus, with a market value of $6.9bn, is also in negotiations to sell an office building with  apartment
conversion potential at Sydney’s 201 Elizabeth Street to  Chinese  developer Fosun International for more than
$430m.

It is also rezoning a car  park  on Melbourne’s Flinders Street so it can accommodate a  residential  tower.

The Burwood  property , which has a short-term lease to the NSW government, was  sold  with zoning for a
mixed-use project.

Holdmark and the agents on the deal, Savills’ Simon Fenn, Stuart Cox, Ben Azar and Neil Cooke, declined to
comment last night.

Dexus would use the  sale  proceeds to pay off debt, Mr Steinberg said yesterday. He added that the  group
sold  $930m worth of  property  in the year to June. “This  transaction  is consistent with our strategy of
divesting non-core  assets ,” Mr Steinberg said.

“While there is future development opportunity at the  site , we have made the decision to capitalise on strong
current investor demand and Dexus’s share of the gain on  sale  will flow through to our net tangible  assets .”
Last year Dexus  sold  a  property  in Sydney’s Rosebery to Harry Triguboff’s Meriton  Group  for more than
$190m.

The  purchase  is a boost for the Macquarie  Park -based Holdmark, led by its founder Sarkis Nassif, with the
group  gathering pace over the past two years as a developer in the Sydney market.

Holdmark has been especially busy in Burwood, the suburb of its first ever project.

The  group  last year paid $80m for the Burwood Plaza shopping centre in Sydney’s inner west, with plans for a
mixed-use development with about 340 apartments and 16,000sq m of extra retail space.

It also last year bought a Burwood office building with development potential from Tony Pitt’s 360 Capital  Group
for about $80m.

Mr Nassif founded Holdmark 27 years ago when he emigrated from his native Lebanon.
