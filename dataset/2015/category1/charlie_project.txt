LP  China National Offshore Oil Corp, or CNOOC, has issued its second LNG supply tender, offering one cargo for
loading December 25-26 from the BG-operated Queensland Curtis LNG or QCLNG export plant in Gladstone,
Australia, market sources said Thursday.

The tender was issued November 4 and closes November 10.

TD  "[CNOOC] is long," a trading source said.

The company was not immediately available for comment.

This is the second supply tender issued by state-owned CNOOC, China's biggest LNG importer. The first, which
closed September 8, offered two cargoes for loading over October 19-23 and November 18-19. Both were sold
on an FOB basis at a DES-equivalent price in the low $7s/MMBtu.

CNOOC began marketing volumes from QCLNG in late 2014 due to lower-than-expected consumption by its
downstream customers, trading sources said at the time.

The company has a 50% equity interest in QCLNG Train 1 and a contract with BG Group for the procurement of
5 million mt/year of LNG (234 Bcf/yr or 6.61 Bcm/yr of gas) from the seller's portfolio.

BG Group loaded its first cargo from QCLNG Train 2 on July 10 for delivery to CNOOC's Zhuhai LNG terminal.

The two-train of the QCLNG plant is due to reach its nameplate production capacity of 8 million mt/yr in mid-
2016.
