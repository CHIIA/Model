Hollywood filmmaking with stars including Matthew McConaughey and Julia Roberts is a long way from the oil
and gas fields owned by Santos in Australia but Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital casts its net wide.

TD  Project Merino, the secret code name for Hony's $700 million investment in the ailing Santos was its first big

purchase in Australia and came weeks after it was a final bidder in the sale process for Melbourne-based
vitamins firm Swisse Wellness, which was ultimately sold to Hong Kong's Biostime International for $1.67 billion
on September 16.

Hony, which has its head office in Beijing, is spearheaded by the entrepreneurial John Zhao who is still the
president of the $10.4 billion firm after founding it in 2003 as an offshoot of China's Legend Holdings , the
holding company for the world's biggest personal computer maker, Lenovo. Lenovo was founded by Liu
Chuanzhi, who was previously a member of China's National People's Congress, China's parliament. He
remains Lenovo's chairman.

One of the biggest private equity firms in China, Hony has also been ploughing funds into the Hollywood movie
studio STX Entertainment, producer of the Adam Sandler film The Waterboy, and is targeting returns from movie
budgets of between $US20 million ($28 billion) and $US80 million. Hony's Mr Zhao is one of two Hony
representatives on the STX board.
