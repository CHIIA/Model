LP  AN UNNAMED  property  developer with links to  China  is the latest to  buy  into booming Box Hill.

The  site  at 820 Whitehorse Rd, which changed hands for $18.8 million – setting a record land value in the area
of $10,588 per sq m – was  sold  by Savills. Savills state director CBD and Metropolitan Clinton Baxter said the
developer planned to build “at least a 25-level  apartment  complex”.

TD  “They have quite a few developments around Melbou rne; they are a local deve loper and they do have links to

China ,’’ Mr Baxter said.

“They have developments in the city and they have found that it is becoming too difficult to move around with
[Planning Minister] Richard Wynne’s interim density law in the city.’’ The  site  is home to a two-storey office
building and is marked  Commercial  Zone Schedule 1. Mr Baxter said the  property sold  without a permit but
was in an activity centre marked for multi-storey development.

The tower will have plenty of  company , with work on the Asian Pacific  Group ’s Whitehorse Towers – a $330 
million 36- and 26-store dual tower  residential  development with a five-star  hotel  – starting last month and the
to-be-built 20-storey Australian Taxation Office at 990 Whitehorse Rd.

Council general manager city development Jeff Green said there had been no  recent planning applications for
the  site .The Box Hill Structure Plan lists the  site  in Activity Precinct B and Built Form Precinct F, which is the
primary office precinct in the activity centre and encourages taller buildings.
