LP  Iris Capital has sold the Oxford Hotel in the Sydney suburb of Drummoyne for $34 million, making it the second-
biggest gaming hotel sale of the year, behind the $40 million sale of the Oasis on Beamish in Western Sydney in
May.

The Oxford Hotel, at 195 Victoria Road, was purchased by private operators Michael Wiggins and Joanne
Cassar, who will partially fund the acquisition with the sale of the Royal Exhibition Hotel in Surry Hills.

TD  The Oxford, which has 30 gaming machines, just underwent a $4 million renovation, and the sale includes an

adjacent retail property.

Iris Capital, a hospitality and development company, has been both a buyer and seller of real estate this year. It
bought the iconic Bourbon bar and restaurant in Kings Cross, but later sold the nearby Crest Hotel site and the
Crown Hotel in Parramatta to China's largest developer, Greenland Group.

Sam Arnaout, chief executive of Iris Capital, said the group constantly assesses the market and looks at assets
individually.

"We are continually assessing market conditions and identified a quality asset such as the Oxford would
generate a premium in this climate," he said.

The deal was negotiated on behalf of Iris Capital by Daniel Dragicevich of CBRE Hotels and John Musca of JLL
Hotels & Hospitality Group.

"The market has again experienced a year of high asset turnover and sales activity as the spread between
capitalisation and borrowing rates remains attractive to both existing participants and new entrants into the pubs
sector," Mr Dragicevich said.

Mr Musca said the sale was one of many top gaming hotels to trade this year. The pricing level reflects asset
supply constraints and earnings growth more than yield compression, he said.

The properties occupy a combined 974-square-metre site, which could be developed further, with the potential
for height increases and scope for a rooftop bar.
