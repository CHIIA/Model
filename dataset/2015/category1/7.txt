LP  SANTOS has bitten the bullet on the impact of the devastating intersection of low — likely, sustained low — oil
(and gas) prices with the boomtime billions it poured into its Queensland coal-seam gas project via an almost
mirror-image capital raising to that of fellow and similarly challenged energy and boomtime coal seam gas
enthusiast, Origin Energy .

But with a fascinating and pregnant-with-future-potential twist — a pre-issue placement to the previously
unheard of Hony Capital , a “China-based international private equity firm,” at a premium to market.

TD  Hony will then have 8 per cent of Santos’s pre-issue capital and will take up its entitlement in the issue in full,

averaging down its entry cost and so the premium it is paying to gain a significant stake in Santos.

Like Origin, as discussed in these columns, the Santos issue will be at a very significant — but utterly sensible
(and costless to shareholders) — discount to market, so it should not pose any ‘will-I-or-won’t-I?’ challenges to
retail shareholders.The raising of $3.5 billion had to be done. It is being done well.
