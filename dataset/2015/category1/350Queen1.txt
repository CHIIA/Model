LP  Melbourne's reputation as the skyscraper capital of Australia will be further boosted after a  Chinese  developer

lodged plans to build a twin skyscraper complex on Queen and La Trobe streets.

Just six months after buying the massive corner  site  for $135 million, a  company  called 3L Alliance has submitted
plans for two soaring 79-level towers at 350 Queen that will stretch far higher than the nearby 55-level Melbourne
Central building on Elizabeth Street.

TD  The completed towers at 267.8 metres will be just 30 metres shorter than the city's current tallest building, the 92-

level Eureka tower completed in 2006.

The city's latest high-rise proposal follows hard on the heels of a series of other super-tall structures in planning or
under construction, fuelled by an offshore-driven  apartment  boom.

Another landmark tower in Southbank is set to rise 81 levels, or 259 metres, on the corner of City Road and
Clarendon Street.

It will be taller than Southbank's newly completed 72-level Prima Pearl building, but shorter than the country's tallest
building, Australia 108, which is expected to rise 100 levels, or 319 metres, on the same side of the Yarra River.

The fresh proposal is likely to test new Planning Minister Richard Wynne who recently rejected another high-rise
apartment  planed by Grocon for 85 Spring Street.

3L Alliance's structure at 350 Queen will cost $750 million to build and will include a public plaza, a creche and
nearly 2000 square metres of retail space.

The towers will stand behind KTS House, a 21-storey office that will remain on the  site . The structure will dwarf its
immediate neighbour, the tiny Welsh Church building.

3L Alliance is controlled by  Chinese  nationals Baoyu Li and Lin Xiong. The pair  purchased  the  site , known as
KTS House, in October last year from a private Malaysian investment  group .

The towers will have about 1700 apartments with resident facilities that include four large swimming pools, saunas,
spas and gyms, a home theatre, communal kitchens, karaoke rooms and a yoga studio.
