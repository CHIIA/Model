LP  FEDERAL politicians tasted Australia's best farm produce but also sampled a dose of Mother Nature's ill-timed

interventions, when it rained on the Australian Parliament Farmers' Market in Canberra last week.

The event was an initiative between the National Farmers' Federation and the Parliamentary Friends of Primary
Producers.

TD  It showcased a diverse range of food and fibre products, including beef, grains, dairy, forestry, horticulture,

seafood and pork.

PFPP co-convenor and Liberal MP Nola Marino said the event helped to educate parliamentarians about food
production.

She believed the inaugural event would also grow and expand in future years.

"We want to make sure that the members of parliament understand the connection between who grows their
food and the food that they're eating," she said.

"If you're out there enjoying some of the wonderful produce, you need to know that it's grown and produced by
Australian farmers."

Opposition agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon said it was important to raise the profile of Australian
agriculture in parliament and reinforce the connection between the farming community and food.

But the PFPP co-convenor said the farmers' market day was not just about food production it was also about
fibre products like wool and cotton.

NFF chief executive officer Simon Talbot thanked parliamentarians for attending the event that aimed to promote
Australian agriculture.

He said the farm sector was on the cusp of a "boom" and was valued at $57 billion and growing at 8 per cent.

"We have to continue the bipartisan approach," he said.

Sanger Australia CEO James Campbell said his company was part of the Bindaree Beef Group and participated
in the promotion to showcase its brands to the nation's political leaders.

He said Bindaree also anticipated expanding trade opportunities for Australian beef in export markets like China,
having recently signed a deal that gave China's fourth-largest pork processor, Shandong Delisi Food Co, a 45pc
stake in his company, valued at $140 million.

"We see that Australian agriculture has a very bright future," he said.

"The free trade agreement with China is an essential tool that was negotiated by government but will be
executed by business.

"From Bindaree's perspective we're technically invested in China (following the Shandong deal) and that's a
strong commitment for our business and to achieve greater synergies over time."

Australian Dairy Farmers and Dairy Australia showcased a range of products including Australian Grand Dairy
Award-winning cheeses and Sharma's Kitchen flavoured milk.

ADF president Noel Campbell said the event was an important opportunity to establish stronger ties with
decision-makers and to demonstrate that supportive policy could provide farmers with the confidence to invest in
best practice initiatives and for the wider industry to invest in a strong future.

"We want to ensure every member of parliament understands the challenges and opportunities facing our
primary food producers," he said.

"We are working to invest in ourselves but it is not just up to us.

"Industry and government must work together to ensure Australian agriculture reaches its full potential."
