Government Property NSW has netted $22.4 million by offloading an office block in Pyrmont to
Chinese-backed private developer Thirdi Group.

The Sydney-based developer headed by George Zhang in collaboration with Ron Dadd, Luke Berry and
Robert Huxley has bought the 1846sq m site with plans to build about 50 apartments atop a ground-floor
supermarket or retail space.

...
“With a current median unit price of $950,000 in Pyrmont and the preference for inner-city apartment living,
prices are expected to achieve over $18,000 a square metre,” Mr Cox said.
“And this site combined a remarkable location with exceptional potential for luxury residential apartments
which attracted a multitude of inquiries from local and international developers.” The sale comes as the state
government property arm offloads a number of inner-city sites in a bid to raise funds that will help construct
more affordable homes in suburbs further out.
For Thirdi Group, the sale marks the end of a near year-long hunt for property in the enclave walking
distance from the city.The group has bid on other high-profile sites in the area and emerged as the
underbidder for an office building at 30 Ross Street in Forest Lodge, which sold to TPG for $30m in late
2014.
