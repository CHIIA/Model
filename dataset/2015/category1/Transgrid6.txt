LP  State Grid, Macquarie Infrastructure Real Assets likely bid over $10bn for NSW network.

State Grid and its partner, Macquarie Infrastructure Real Assets, is believed to have bid more than $10 billion for
the NSW government’s transmission network.

TD  The knockout price is likely to clinch the deal in the closely watched contest.

The other bidding groups most likely lobbed offers of between $9.5bn and $10bn, sources said.

Final bids were due yesterday.

Some believe that should one consortium offer a price far higher than others, a preferred party will be
announced tomorrow or Thursday, but if bids are close, it could take a fortnight for the government to announce
a buyer.

State Grid and its Macquarie backers have been under the spotlight since the Deutsche and UBS-run contest
began, with some questioning whether the consortium would secure approval from the Foreign Investment
Review Board for its offer.

The 99-year Trans Grid lease is said to be the most sought-after NSW government electricity asset up for sale,
because it offers 100 per cent ownership and full management control.

Of all the state government assets for sale, it is thought to be the business least directly affected by the
increasing threat of households using their own solar panels to generate power.

TransGrid’s regulated asset base is about $6bn, and it has been widely expected to sell for more than 1.4 times
that number, which had previously placed sale price expectations at about $9bn.

Spark Infrastructure and its bidding partners, advised by JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Canada, are understood
to have secured a $500 million bridging loan to fund its proposal.

Its backers include Hastings Funds Management, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Canada’s Caisse de depot et
placement du Quebec, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Kuwait’s Wren House.

Others include IFM and Queensland Investment Corporation, advised by Lazard and Barclays and Australian
Super with the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and Borealis, all advised by Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs.

Meanwhile, one theory circling the market is that State Grid could eventually angle for a takeover of the $5.3bn-
listed energy provider Ausnet.

The Chinese government-backed company already owns about 20 per cent.

This would be a possibility if State Grid was unsuccessful in securing the government’s $7.4bn-plus distribution
network Ausgrid.

State Grid, which is the world’s largest utility operator and one of the 10 largest companies globally, is after fully
owned operational expertise to run TransGrid, according to some market analysts, but the company does not
have this in Australia.

Information memorandums for the asset sale are expected to be sent out around mid-December, with all of the
same bidding consortium groups for TransGrid expected to line up.

Meanwhile, Macquarie’s move to draft in PGGM could see the Dutch pension fund make one of its first major
Australian acquisitions.

Hesta is also working with State Grid’s partner, the Macquarie infrastructure arm, which is widely known as
MIRA.
