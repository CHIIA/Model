LP  A BRISBANE development company is on track to start construction on its first residential project in Brisbane.

Raykong Property, a company associated with the Zhang family which has been developing commercial and residential property in China since 2002, has
plans for a $96 million mixed-use project comprising twin 15-storey towers in Upper Mt Gravatt.

TD  Brisbane City Council is expected to make a decision on the development application within two to four weeks.

The proposed 174-apartment complex is on a 3154sq m, four lot residential block at 7-15 Cremin St that Raykong purchased late last year for $5.28 million.

If approved, the project’s towers will be the highest in Upper Mt Gravatt and they will offer sweeping views of the surrounding area and east to Moreton Bay.

The development will incorporate retail and commercial areas, a shared basement and podium level, as well as communal rooftop facilities for residents
including a swimming pool, outdoor cinema, private dining room and a barbecue area.

Project manager, PDS Group director Michael Sutherland said the site was within 200m of Westfield Garden City, Kessels Rd and Logan Rd.

He expects owner-occupiers to account for 50 to 60 per cent of apartment buyers.“This is a very convenient location with Garden City and Griffith University
nearby,” Mr Sutherland said.
