LP  Dexus Property Group said construction of the office towers at Kings Square was on track and nearing

completion but the handover may not include a tenancy for engineering firm John Holland.

The property group’s office and industrial executive general manager Kevin George said the development was
broadly in line with the construction program.

TD  Office tower KS2, which will be the new home for Royal Dutch Shell from early next year, has reached practical

completion, as has KS3, which has been leased to John Holland. Construction has almost finished on the
22,000sqm KS1, which is still for lease.

State-owned Chinese giant China Communications Construction Company purchased John Holland for $1.15
billion earlier this year from Leighton Holdings and Mr George said since the sale, it was not clear if John
Holland would go ahead with its plan to move into the new CBD project.

“I think the new owner has decided that they won’t move into it but they are paying us rent and they are still
working out their future and how much if anything they are going to take,” Mr George said.

“They have a lease with us for 10 years on the building.

“It may be they decide to sublease that tenancy but, from our point of view, we are getting rent from John
Holland on that space.”

John Holland declined to comment.

In a 2013 fund-through deal, Leighton Properties on-sold three office towers it would build at Kings Square to
Dexus for $435 million.

As part of the purchase, Dexus obtained a rental guarantee that would ensure full income on the properties for
five years after practical completion.

“When Dexus looked at this opportunity three years ago we were mindful the situation in Perth was not always
going to be as buoyant as it was then,” Mr George said.

“We were keen to invest in the asset because we think its a terrific strategic site in terms of the evolution of the
Perth central business district.

“The pricing we achieved and the structure of the deal was very much aligned to giving us comfort through any
downturn.

“From out point of view we have new buildings producing incomes from as soon as they are complete.”

When it was finished, Mr George said Kings Square would benefit from the northward expansion of the city and
would provide an easier and a safer transition for people between the CBD and Northbridge.

“For those reasons, Kings Square becomes very valuable over time, particularly the retail offering we are
creating, where there will be more natural ant tracks for people to transition between two very important zones in
the city.”

Dexus, one of the CBD’s biggest landlords, is forecasting Perth office vacancies will peak around 22 per cent in
the next year.

“It’s clearly a challenging market and there’s still some supply coming on, ours included, that will impact on
vacancies,” Mr George said. “We think the market will start to stabilise through FY17 and recover in the ensuing
few years.”
