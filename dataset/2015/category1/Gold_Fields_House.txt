SYDNEY'S Circular Quay precinct is to get a facelift with the addition of a five-star hotel and
upmarket apartments, following the sale of the Gold Fields House at 1 Alfred St to the Chinese
Dalian Wanda Group for A$415 million (NZ$443m).

The sale is one of the largest along the landmark strip, which is earmarked for several
redevelopment projects that will start this year.

Global investment group Blackstone sold the site, which it acquired when it took over Valad
Property Group in 2011.

The sale was negotiated through CBRE and JLL.

Blackstone has been reviewing all possibilities for the well-known 1960s-vintage property,
including redevelopment into apartments.

Blackstone's head of real estate Asia, Chris Heady, confirmed the binding agreement had been
signed with Dalian Wanda, saying Gold Fields House has been successfully repositioned and
planning approvals obtained to redevelop the office building into one of Sydney's "premium
residential developments".

A spokesperson from Wanda said the group recognised the "iconic location", and intended to
create a mixed-use development including a five-star hotel, luxury residential properties and retail
outlets. Fairfax
