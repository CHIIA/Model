Metro Property Development, founded by property identity David
Devine, plans to book a $24 million proﬁt in just over six months
by selling a site to Chinese real estate giant R&F Properties.

by Matthew Cranston

The Hong Kong-listed, Guangzhou-based R&F is in due diligence
to pay $46 million, more than twice the $22 million Metro paid for
the former TAFE college in south Brisbane last December.

The deal, which is set to go unconditional this month, shows how capital ﬂowing out
of Asia, particularly China and Singapore, into Australia is quickly moving from the
booming cities of Melbourne and Sydney to the undervalued Brisbane market.

Mr Devine declined to comment on the deal but told the Financial Review Sunday
program he expected a wave of Chinese investment in property to come. He predicted
the foreign capital would contribute to an oversupply of apartment stock in Australia.

The RBA has been monitoring the impacts offshore capital could have on the
competitiveness of Australian banks looking to lend to local developers. Local
developers have restrictions on how much they can borrow and how many
apartments they can sell to overseas buyers, whereas the offshore-backed developers
do not.

The Australian Taxation Ofﬁce has also been monitoring the impacts of offshore
capital on local developer’s decisions to sell out.

In comments unrelated to Metro’s potential property deal, the ATO’s Deputy
Commissioner Tim Dyce said last week the tax ofﬁce had begun auditing property
developers  carrying out activities which conﬂict with their stated purpose of capital
investment.

“A growing number of property developers are using trusts to suggest a development

“The developer might be saying “We have had a nice little bit of interest from overseas
for this property so we might take a nice little capital gain," but the developer would
have to prove to the tax ofﬁce the true intention of the property," she said.

“The developer would have to make sure there was never any marketing for a
development or that there were never any internal minutes documenting an intention
to develop."

There is no suggestion Mr Devine’s Metro would look for a capital gain concession if it
sold its site.

Dozens of mainly Asian-backed buyers have been picking up residential development
sites all along the eastern seaboard rapidly changing the dynamics of development
and the pricing of apartments and buyer demographics. The competition has priced
out Australian listed developers such as Mirvac.

The R&F deal with Metro is the ﬁrst major Chinese purchase in Brisbane following
several Singaporean listed companies buying in the city in the last few weeks.

Tycoon Koh Wee Seng’s Singapore-listed Aspial Corporation, the developer of
Melbourne’s Australia 108 project, is closing in on an inner city site owned by SEQ
Water for $25 million. At the same time, Singapore-based hotel and resorts operator
Banyan Tree snapped up the  Newman government’s prime  residential property site
atop the Kangaroo Point cliffs facing Brisbane city for about $15 million.

Mr Devine’s Metro is also expected to see the Chinese R&F Properties buy one of its
Kangaroo Point properties for $19 million and market sources indicate the Chinese
group is set for even further acquisitions in the Brisbane market.

The move by R&F, which has more than 20 years experience in property
development, reﬂects the growing level of Chinese capital ﬂowing out of the country.

Several offshore funds set up in overseas countries to buy property in Australia have
been used as natural hedges against local currency or property markets.

Investec’s Australia Property Fund, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, acts
as a natural  currency hedge for South African investors.
