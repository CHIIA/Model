LP  SHANGHAI, May 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --  Solar  Power, Inc. ("SPI") (OTCBB: SOPW), a vertically-integrated
photovoltaic ("PV") project developer, today announced its wholly owned subsidiary, SPI  China  (HK) Limited,
has completed the  acquisition  of 80% of the outstanding capital stock of  Solar  Juice Pty Ltd (" Solar  Juice"),
the leading  solar  PV wholesale distribution business in Australia in 2013 and 2014 by wholesale volume,
according to SolarBusinessServices, Pty Ltd ("SBS"), an independent Australia-based research and consulting
firm . The  acquisition  was previously announced on March 31, 2015.

According to SBS, Australia had more than 3 gigawatts (GW) of cumulative installed PV capacity, including more
than 750 MW installed during 2014, dominated by the residential segment in recent years.

TD  A bipartisan deal on Australia's Renewable  Energy  Target (RET) was reached on May 18, 2015, and is poised

to unlock the significant potential of renewable  energy  in Australia in the coming years. To deliver the 33,000
GWh revised target as provided by the RET deal will require approximately 6,000 MW of new renewable
energy  capacity to be built by 2020. Australia has already approved renewable  energy  projects with an
expected aggregate capacity of approximately 6,600 MW, the majority being large-scale  solar  and  wind
projects.

"We are delighted to announce the closing of this deal with  Solar  Juice, " said Xiaofeng Peng, Chairman of SPI.
"The timing is particularly advantageous given the recent RET deal in Australia, which is expected to create
more than $10  billion  worth of investment in renewable  energy  projects over the coming years. We are
confident that we have the strongest local platform and partner in  Solar  Juice to capitalize on this enormous
market opportunity."
