THE Sino-Australian milk processing and farming consortium comprising Leppington Pastoral Company,
New Hope Dairy Holdings and Freedom Foods Group has completed its acquisition of the $100m Moxey
Farms business in Central West NSW.

Moxey Farms, one of Australia's largest single-site dairy operations, runs a 3700-cow farming operation in
the Lachlan Valley near Gooloogong, 340 kilometres west of Sydney.

Moxey Farms' portfolio on 2700 hectares produces about 50 million litres of milk annually.

The Moxey family will continue to operate the farming business based at "The Angle" dairy in a joint
venture with the Perich family which also owns a similar large-scale farming enterprise at Leppington
Pastoral's Bringelly base, south west of Sydney.

The Moxey-Perich joint venture, flagged in May, is now officially part of a farm management agreement
with the newly formed consortium Australian Fresh Milk Holdings (AFMH).

The Moxey family, including principal Janet Moxey and her children Quentin, Jill and Rose and their
spouses, has also picked up a strategic stake in AFMH as part of the deal.

The completion of the acquisition confirms AFMH's strategic operations across every aspect of the dairy
value chain including processing activities in Australia and China and distribution networks in China.

AFMH is expected to further invest in additional greenfield dairy production sites as part of its plan to
become a significant player in the Australian dairy industry.

AFMH director and dairy manager at Leppington, Michael Perich, described the Moxey Farms acquisition as
an "exciting step forward" for Australian Fresh Milk Holdings which provided the new export dairy player

with a great opportunity to enhance its expertise in high performance dairy farming.

"We look forward to building a strong and successful relationship with Moxey Farms," he said.

Mr Moxey, the general manager of his family's business said the company's objective since establishing two
generations ago (in the Hawkesbury Valley west of Sydney) had always been to build a world-class milk
production platform.

Early last year the Moxeys began reviewing their operations with the aim of finding a strategic partner to
assist with a new growth stage, which includes establishing other farms similar to "The Angle" elsewhere in
eastern Australia.

The review included considering taking on equity partners from overseas to help fund the family company's
expansion plans.

"We are pleased to partner with AFMH on the development of Moxey Farms and the establishment of
additional world class greenfield dairy farming operations in Australia," Mr Moxey said.

The consortium agreement allows AFMH to leverage Sydney-based Freedom Foods' processing capabilities
and New Hope Dairy's Asian footprint to readily access export markets in China and South East Asia.

Freedom currently produces a range of long-life carton beverage products, breakfast cereals and snack bars
and has an ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated export milk operation at its Pactum Dairy site at
Shepparton, Victoria a joint venture with nearby family farming business Australian Consolidated Milk.

This is the A team of dairy. Moxey, Perich and New Hope is a pretty impressive line up. A good model of
co-investment with an international consumer and Aussie management expertise. It shows good support for
the value & direction of NSW dairy.

I wonder how much milk from this dairy will now be on the Australian market , or will it all get shipped
straight to China for their own use ....

Hi Jock. I think it benefits from a Chinese interest by being able to access that export market. The only way
past the Colesworths dilemna for the NSW dairy industry is to develop new export markets. We have
nowhere to sell new production from growth without export. By having a co-investment they get access to
the export market and maximise the value of their management expertise.
