THREE buyers flew from overseas specifically to inspect a Wonga Park mansion that has sold for
$6.1 million.

Two of the buyers negotiated around $6 million before a Chinese property developer with business
interests in Australia secured the property at 8 Jamieson Rd.

The price smashed the record for a property in Wonga Park. The previous record was $4.67 million.

Agent Matthew Lockyer, of Jellis Craig Doncaster, said the sale, which followed a similar price paid
for a trophy home in Chirnside Park, proved the top end of the market was very strong in the middle
and outer eastern suburbs.

He agreed that the sales showed that sellers could not overcapitalise if they offered the style and
features that discerning buyers want.

“These clients do not look at the cost or evidence of past sales,” Mr Lockyer said.

“They want the best of the best.

“They want a statement and they’ll pay for it.” The luxury home includes a formal living room with an
8.4m ceiling, three other living areas, a wine cellar, a separate guesthouse, a heated pool,
mod-grass tennis court, sauna and gym on a 2.4ha property.

It was built about two years ago by a builder of luxury properties as his own home.For more real
