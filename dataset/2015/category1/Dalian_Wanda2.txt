LP  Hong Kong's record office building transaction

In an effort to boost its international profile, Chinese developer Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. agreed to
buy the Mass Mutual Tower in Hong Kong's Wanchai for HK$12.50 billion from Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd.,
the most ever paid for an office building in the city.

TD  The 26-floor Grade A office building is fully occupied and has 32,090.9 square meters of office and commercial

space.

Chinese Estates saw the property's price climb more than 20x the sum it paid over 10 years ago, according to
Bloomberg News. The previous most-expensive office transaction in Hong Kong was the HK$5.4 billion paid by
Citigroup Inc. for Wheelock Properties' Kowloon Bay project in 2014.

Beyond the Great Wall of China

* On the same day after Evergrande's deal was announced, China Life Insurance (Group) agreed to buy an
office building with a two-story retail block at One HarbourGate in Hung Hom from Wheelock and Co. Ltd. for
HK$5.85 billion, making it the second-most expensive building purchase in Hong Kong and the largest single
office-tower transaction in Kowloon district, according to the South China Morning Post.

The assets include the 15-story West Office Tower, totaling about 357,000 square feet of gross area, and the
36,000-square-foot West Retail Villa. China Life intends to use the property as the headquarters of its unit,
China Life Insurance (Overseas) Co. Ltd.

* Besides Hong Kong, Chinese companies are also looking for opportunities in Australia. Dalian Wanda Group
Co. Ltd., the parent of Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co. Ltd., has entered into negotiations with the
Queensland government for the acquisition of a land parcel for a theme park development at Coomera on the
Gold Coast, following the Chinese company's newly opened US$2.5 billion Xishuangbanna resort in China's
Yunnan province, The Australian reported, citing Dalian Wanda General Manager Xie Hong.

* China Investment Corp. and Chinese-backed property developer JQZ are believed to be buying Goodman
Group's development sites near the Sydney Olympic Park in western Sydney, The Australian Financial Review
reported.

CIC is reported to be in due diligence for the estimated A$660 million acquisition of a development site in
Goodman's Carter Street industrial precinct, while JQZ is tipped to be nearing the completion of acquiring a site
in the same area for over A$200 million.

Institutional investors in real estate

* After Qatar Investment Authority teamed up with CapitaLand Ltd.'s The Ascott Ltd. for the US$600 million
serviced residence global fund, the new vehicle has acquired two properties in Tokyo and Paris for US$104
million. These include an office building, which is slated to be converted to a 70-unit Citadines Suites Champs-
Élysées Paris that will open in 2018, and a serviced residence that has been operating as Somerset Shinagawa
Tokyo.

The fund will invest another US$33 million for the conversion and asset enhancement on the properties, bringing
the total investment to US$137 million.
