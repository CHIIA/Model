LP  Melbourne's heated development market has resulted in a nondescript St Kilda Road office selling for nearly 30

per cent above expectations and a listed offshore developer moving into middle ring suburbs.

China -backed developer Golden Asset outmuscled a mix of investors, owner-occupiers and local developers to
snap up a five-level stand-alone office building on the corner of Raleigh Street and St Kilda Road for $12.1
million.

TD  The little-known Golden Asset  group  also owns a large development  site  at 8 Hopkins Street in Footscray

where it is seeking to build six multi-storey towers with 939 apartments.

Selling agent David Minton from GormanKelly said 613 St Kilda Road changed hands on a low yield of 2.4 per
cent, well above the $9.5 million it was expected to fetch.

Mr Minton, who handled the deal with colleague Mario Nobrega, said the 1038-square metre corner  site  was
sought after as a development opportunity because it was offered with vacant possession in two years' time.

"It's a much stronger result than we thought it would be. It's a sign of the times," he said.

If the building is redeveloped it will be the latest in a string of sites on the leafy boulevard to be converted to
upmarket  residential  dwellings.

Two months ago Malaysian developer UEM Sunrise acquired the Victoria Police complex on the same strip with
plans to transform the  site  into an ultra-luxurious  residential apartment  block. The giant fund - effectively a
sovereign wealth player - paid IGR  Property Group  $58 million for the  site .

Another large Asian developer, Bursa Malaysia listed SP Setia, is building an upmarket Karl Fender-designed
19-level complex at 557 St Kilda Road next to Wesley College, a  site  it bought from multi-millionaire
businessman Lloyd Williams' Hudson Conway.

SP Setia's previous Melbourne foray included the Fulton Lane Project next to the Queen Victoria Market.

The  group  has plans to expand beyond its usual city focus into key middle ring suburbs, a territory traditionally
the target of smaller local developers.

It has  purchased  a  residential  development  site  in south-eastern Carnegie for $6.68 million in a deal
negotiated by CBRE's Ed Wright, Scott Orchard, and Chao Zhang.

The corner block at 47-251 Neerim Road will make way for a low-rise  apartment  complex in a suburb that has
seen rapid growth in similar developments.

"SP Setia were able to fend off strong competition from local and other offshore developers to secure the
property , with the  transaction  representing more than $139,000 per unit, a new record for Carnegie," Mr
Wright said.
