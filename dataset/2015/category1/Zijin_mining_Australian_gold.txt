China's major gold producer Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd (601899.SH; 02899.HK) an?nounced on Aug. 6
that its wholly owned Norton Gold Fields Limited will offer about 45 million Australian dollars (about 205
million yuan), or 0.10 Australian dollar/share, to ac?quire all the issued shares of Australia's Phoenix Gold
Limited that the Chinese company does not own.
Norton lodged the bidder's statement about the acquisition to the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission (ASIC) on Thursday. The offer will be valid from August 20, 2015 to 7 p.m. (Australian Eastern
Standard time) of September 21, 2015.

As at the date of the announcement, Norton and its associates hold a 17.94-percent relevant interest in
Phoenix, a gold exploration company listed on the Australian Securi?ties Exchange (ASX) with assets cored
on multiple mining rights near Kalgoorlie, West?ern Australia, which cover more than 600 square kilometers.

The transaction will increase company gold resources reserve and be in line with its development strategy,
said Zijin Mining.
The Fujian-based company bought to control Norton in 2012 and bought up the company in mid-2015. The
Chinese participation increased Norton's gold production by 30 percent at a production cost lowered by 20
percent.
Zijin Mining said it will continue to do contribution to local economy and create job oppor?tunities for local
residents through invigorating local gold industry while global gold prices are low.
