LP  EXCLUSIVE  Chinese  conglomerate Fosun International is believed to have entered exclusive due diligence to

buy  a Sydney CBD office tower with  residential  conversion potential for about $430 million.

The  group  is now the preferred party to  buy  a  property  at 201 Elizabeth Street, which is owned Dexus
Property Group  and Perron  Group , according to sources.

TD  The Australian revealed last month that Fosun had made an offer on the building, bidding against a rival

Chinese  syndicate.

It is thought that the talks have now progressed further with Fosun heading the race.

The building was first put on the market last year as an  apartment  conversion play, but its suitor,  China ’s
Dalian Wanda  Group , pulled out of the  purchase  due to uncertainties about the eventual planning outcome.

Its co-owners are trying to get the  site  approved for development, and the deal being finalised may be
predicated on their ability to do so, according to sources.

It is believed that Savills has introduced Fosun.

Fosun, Dexus, Perron and Savills declined to comment.

The move by Fosun shows that  Chinese  developers continue to be attracted to  apartment  projects in the
Sydney CBD, despite fears of an overheated market and concerns about  China ’s own economic
circumstances.

It would follow moves by a host of Asian developers in the Sydney CBD to convert old office buildings into
glistening  apartment  towers.

Hong Kong -listed Shimao  Property ,  China ’s Dalian Wanda  Group , Visionary Investment  Group  and
Singapore’s Far East Organization are among those with conversions in the pipeline.

China ’s largest developer, Greenland  Group , is building a $700m  apartment  and  hotel  project on the old
headquarters of Sydney Water at Bathurst Street.

Elsewhere in Sydney, a number of  Chinese  companies have made aggressive offers on an office tower at 117
Clarence Street towards the northern end of the city.

The building, owned by Altis  Property  Partners is expected to reap about $80m.  Chinese  conglomerate
Nanshan  Group  has run its ruler over the  property , while other  Chinese  companies King  Group  and Chip
Eng have also shown interest.

Local  group  EG Funds Management is also one of the lead contenders, according to sources.

The owners initially aimed to sell the building with the adjoining pub to create a bigger development scheme, but
many have shown interest in just the office component.Altis and the agents on the building, CI Australia and
Knight Frank, declined to comment.
