LP  ONE of Tasmania’s leading whisky distilleries is set to move after the sale of the historic Redlands Estate

property in the Derwent Valley.

The Redlands Estate Distillery in Plenty announced on its website earlier this week that it would relocate after
the estate sold for an undisclosed sum.

TD  While the buyer and price for the property are unknown, it received significant interest from China with reports

the property could fetch as much as $4 million.

The 1819 estate, which comprises of a historic homestead and 101ha of fertile land, was put on the market in
March.

Derwent Valley Mayor Martyn Evans was optimistic that the sale would bring added benefits to the region.

“Obviously it’s been for sale for not a great deal of time,” he said. “From council’s perspective it’s great to see
values of such a unique property going for some really good prices in that term.

“The opportunity is there and for a person to have bought it they would’ve seen opportunities for the future.” The
distillery is expected to announce more details on its relocation later in the week. Cr Evans is confident it will
stay within the Derwent Valley.

“They’re working on a site within the Derwent Valley to create that whisky experience in another location,” he
said. “That’s a good thing for us to keep that brand and keep that paddock to the bottle basic program
going.”The company is one of only two paddock-to-bottle distilleries in the world.
