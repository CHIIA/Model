LP  Rumours swirl around the potential sale of home appliance retailer The Good Guys, while Santos looks to Asia

for a cornerstone investor.

One of Australia’s largest privately held firms is seen on the chopping block at the right price, with a deal in
excess of $1 billion potentially in the offing.

TD  Elsewhere, Santos’ hunt for a cornerstone investor gathers momentum, Sankaty Partners waits on a decision

from GE Capital and IVE Group takes another shot at an IPO.

Retailer The Good Guys was the subject of a takeover hoax near the end of last month as false rumours of an
acquisition by UK-based Dixons hit the airwaves. It turns out there may be a sliver of truth to talk of a sale,
however, as The Australian Financial Review reports owners the Muir family are willing sellers at the right price.

The firm was put on market in 2011 but interested parties, including private equity firms and Wesfarmers ,
flinched at the $1bn asking price. The retailer has since enjoyed strong growth and while several unsolicited
offers have been rejected in recent years, a strong bid could get a deal done. Private equity would again be
prime candidates, though a trade buyer is seen preferred.

Meanwhile, the prospect of Santos taking on a cornerstone investor is believed
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/5/mergers-acquisitions/santos-sell-struggles] to have been
driven by lowball bids for several of its non-core assets. An offer for its Cooper Basin assets from private equity
firm KKR reportedly came in well shy of a $1.5bn valuation, while a Macquarie JV eyeing Santos’ WA assets
also purportedly delivered a proposal short of the seller’s expectations.

It makes a sale of a 15 per cent stake and a rights issue to existing shareholders an increasingly likely
proposition. Santos is looking to Asia to find its cornerstone investor, with the AFR tagging HK-listed ENN
Energy as the lead candidate after earlier reports centred on China’s Sinopec .

In finance, Sankaty Partners will discover in the next week whether it has been successful in the auction of GE
Capital ’s remaining Australian operations. A delay in the process was reportedly down to GE ’s disappointment
in the final bids, but a sale still appears likely to close.

Sankaty has been working with Deutsche Bank on the deal, though it’s now believed
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/5/mergers-acquisitions/sankaty-kept-edge] the German
entity’s involvement is primarily in funding the bid.

In the IPO market, printing and marketing firm IVE Group is again pursuing a $150m IPO, while IT company
Over the Wire is hoping to raise $10m through a December 3 listing on the ASX , according to the AFR.

Elsewhere, Ramsay Healthcare is close to signing a major JV with a leading Chinese hospital group. The deal
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/5/dataroom/chinese-jv-coup-ramsay] with Jinan University
No 1 Affiliated Hospital , which could be announced today, will see the two combine to develop and operate a
number of hospitals in the region.

Finally, a deadline for Anheuser-Busch InBev ’s $145bn takeover of SABMiller has been extended
[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/11/4/mergers-acquisitions/ab-inbev-sabmiller-deadline-
extended] as complex details are worked out, while the AFR reports the government’s sale of the ASIC registry
business has received more than 10 expressions of interest, with the likes of Computershare , ASX and Veda
seen involved.
