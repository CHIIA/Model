LP  Sales of agricultural land across Australia in the 12 months to August reached $14.5  billion , slightly down on

the previous month because of the traditional winter slowdown.

But while the total was less than the $14.94  billion  recorded-worth in the year to May, a store of big-deal plans
is likely to send sales data soaring into the new year.

TD  Landmark Harcourts' rolling three-monthly Benchmark rural property report, compiled by CoreLogic RP Data,

shows sales in all the states and territory were down or on a par with previous results.

Just over $6.7  billion  worth of sales in NSW were recorded over the year to August, down from the $6.9
billion  in sales recorded in the year to May.

Landmark Harcourts' NSW state manager Phil Rourke said it was important to look through the winter sales
period.

"This spring compared to last spring is about 10 per cent stronger in terms of value," Mr Rourke said.

Mr Rourke just  sold  grazing property Fullerton Station, near Crookwell, to a local farmer for $3.85  million ,
almost a 10 per cent premium to the property's value a year earlier.

In the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven Region of NSW, $114  million  worth of properties between 40 and
100 hectares were  sold  in the 12-month period through 88 separate transactions.

In Victoria, $3.2  billion  of sales were recorded for the year to August, down from the $3.4  billion  in May.

Landmark's John Stringer said that while the sales figures dropped during the season, a lot of deals had
transacted that will settle in December and January.

"This has actually been the best and biggest year I have ever had since 1981," Mr Stringer said.

He has just  sold  an 800-hectare grazing and cropping property called Rosemount, near Shepparton, to
overseas interests for $2.4  million  and has contracted to sell a 485-hectare property near Euroa called
Springbank for $2.4  million .

He said more Melbourne-based professionals were entering the market.

Queensland had $1.5  billion -worth of sales, unchanged from May, but deals such as BRW Rich Lister Tom
Strachan's purchase of the 7300-hectare Lighthouse station near Roma for $14  million  and  Chinese
billionaire  Xingfa Ma's purchase of Wentworth cattle station will lift the total.

Stand-out areas included the Darling Downs and Maranoa districts, with 90 sales of more than 1000 hectares,
worth $222.5  million .

SA had $819  million  in sales, down slightly from the $827  million  recorded in 12 months to May. WA was
unchanged with $1.6  billion  in sales.

Just over $485  million  of sales were recorded in Tasmania, marginally up on the $484.7  million  in sales
recorded in May. The recent acquisition by a foreign  company  of  dairy  farmer VDL  Dairy , which was to be
sold  to listed  company  OnCard, will boost the  sale  figures significantly next quarter.

NT featured only $198  million  of sales in the year to August, down from $225  million , but that is likely to
change with some huge pastoral deals, including the  sale  of S.Kidman & Co stations and Macquarie  group 's
Walhallow station to  billionaire  Brett Blundy, due to settle this week.
