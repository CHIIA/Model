LP  Chinese  development behemoth Greenland  Group  has finally been confirmed as the buyer of two lots in

Sydney’s north, agreeing to pay $190 million for the government-owned  site  and knocking out rival Japanese,
Chinese  and local groups in the process.

As revealed by The Australian in October, the  Chinese  government-backed Greenland  Group  is purchasing a
1.5ha landholding called Lachlan’s Line at Macquarie  Park  in Sydney’s north in a bid to develop at least 800
apartments and a major shopping centre valued at more than $500m.

TD  Close to 20 parties expressed an interest in Lachlan’s Line, which first hit the market in November last year

through the NSW government’s land development agency, UrbanGrowth.

Apart from Greenland, Japan’s Sekisui House and  China ’s Aqualand are known to have made the second
round in bidding for the major  site . Local  group  Toga was also in the running at one stage.

Greenland is undaunted by the size of the project and in a statement yesterday said it was committed to building
something “truly spectacular” and of a “first-class standard” for Macquarie  Park .

“Greenland looks forward to working hand-in-hand with UrbanGrowth NSW to realise their vision and create
something special for the residents and its community,” said Greenland man aging director Sherwood Luo.

Mr Luo said he hoped to begin construction as early as possible but it depended on when Urban Growth finished
the infrastructure and formally handed over the  site  to Greenland. “We hope that will be by late next year.” Mr
Luo said he had placed a put and call option on the  site  and was still interested in buying more sites,
particularly in NSW.

The Lachlan’s Line  site  came to prominence earlier this year when Greenland rival Meriton Apartments was
shaping up to bid $184m for the  site .

But Meriton was prevented from bidding because the prolific  apartment  developer, run by Harry Triguboff, had
hired  Simeon McGovern, once Urban Growth’s NSW development director.

According to media reports, it was later revealed that Mr McGovern was one of seven people with access to
commercial -in-confidence information on the tender led by  UrbanGrowth. As such, Meriton was prevented
from bidding for the  site , paving the way for Greenland to win the tender.

Meanwhile,  sale  proceeds from the  site , which is bounded by Wicks, Epping and Delhi roads as well as the M2
freeway, will be reinvested in new urban transformation projects, according to UrbanGrowth NSW.

Announced in 2013 as part of the North Ryde Urban Activation Precinct, Lachlan’s Line is a masterplanned
development that will eventually provide about 3000 new homes within 10 minutes of a major train station.

Greenland had global revenue of nearly $US54 billion last year, and was looking at new developments in
Sydney. It was also interested in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and in large-scale urban regeneration projects.

Greenland has been a prolific developer since it arrived in Australia several years ago. Billed as  China ’s largest
developer, Greenland is building a $700m  apartment  and  hotel  project on the former headquarters of the

Leichhardt, in the city’s inner west, raising the ire of residents in the process.CBRE and Matrix  Property
