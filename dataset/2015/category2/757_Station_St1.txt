LP  A  Chinese  buyer has paid $12.7 million for two office buildings in the Tally Ho Business  Park  in Burwood, 17

kilometres east of Melbourne's central business district.

The bigger, two-storey, 2376-square-metre office building was  sold  for $9.2 million on a net yield of 8.7 per cent,
despite the upstairs offices being vacant. The smaller two-storey building of 750 square metres down the road was
sold  for $3.5 million, with a net yield of 7.5 per cent. The building was leased to a single tenant, Yokogawa
Australia, for a net annual rent of $262,000.

TD  Both buildings had low  site  coverage, which would allow the buyer to develop the  site  in the long term.

Ben Galanos of Newton Real  Estate  negotiated the  sale  for long-standing local family investors.

Dogs take a walk

A local developer will develop a dog daycare centre in South Melbourne into a four-storey  apartment  and retail
building after the 611-square- metre building with a 2.7 per cent yield,  sold  for $3.8 million. The building is at 201-
209 Ferrars Street.

The buyer planned three more levels on top of the single-storey building to accommodate 25 apartments, with retail
shops on the ground floor. Dog Day Care would vacate the building in May when the lease expired, and a gym
would take a short-term lease while development approvals were sought.

Colliers International's Andrew Ryan sealed the deal.

Armadale auction

A local developer has locked in an empty building at 737-739 High Street, Armadale, for $2.9 million, beating the
auction reserve by 30 per cent.

The 422-square-metre  site  in Melbourne's south-east was formerly a medical centre with six consulting rooms and
a large on- site  carpark. The  site  was zoned mixed-use and was surrounded by a mix of single and two-storey
buildings occupied by retailers, offices and medical centres.

Chris Kombi of Fitzroys was the selling agent.

Kent Town investment

A local private syndication  group  has acquired a two-level office building in Kent Town in Adelaide as a long-term
passive investment.

and retail shops. The auction drew a crowd of about 100, with six local and offshore bidders.

Retail plans

A local investor has paid $1.6 million for a half-empty retail building in Capalaba in Brisbane's east, after beating
another contender in a tender campaign.

empty. The remaining three were leased to a doctor, an accountant and a loan provider for a combined gross annual
income of $118,000. The buyer planned to refurbish the building and is aggressively chasing more tenants.
