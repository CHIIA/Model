LP  State Grid Corporation of China and Singapore Power-backed Jemena are set to be announced as the preferred

bidder for the Northern Territory's $1 billion gas pipeline.

As revealed by Street Talk Online on Monday night, it is understood Jemena's proposal for the North East Gas
Interconnector project has won government support, beating proposals from the likes of APA Group, DUET
Group and a company owned by China National Petroleum Corporation. Sources said representatives from the
bid groups were flying to Darwin on Monday night before an announcement on Tuesday.

TD  Jemena proposed to build the line using the Queensland route, from Tennant Creek to Mt Isa, which they say

will be cheaper and quicker, and will not rely on any public funding. That route would benefit the Gladstone LNG
export ventures, and mining industry gas customers in Queensland, and is favoured by the Queensland
government.

The win comes after Jemena missed out on EnergyAustralia's Iona Gas Plant in October.

Elsewhere in pipelines, and also as revealed by Street Talk Online on Monday, Origin Energy has shown it is
serious about an $800 million asset sale process, taking pitches from investment banks in a formal request for a
proposal round last week.

It is understood Origin met investment banks last week, seeking pitches for two mandates; an infrastructure sale
process and an upstream gas project. The two auctions are expected to be run separately and commence early
in the new year.

Sources said Origin was seeking an infrastructure and utilities specialist to handle the sale of pipelines at Darling
Downs and Mortlake, and an oil and gas specialist to run the review of selected upstream projects. The sales
are part of $800 million of divestments flagged by Origin when it handed down $4.7 billion in capital initiatives in
September.
