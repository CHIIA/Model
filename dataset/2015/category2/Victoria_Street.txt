LP  Giant  Chinese property  developer Hengyi has emerged as the buyer for a massive development project on the

edge of the Melbourne CBD, which has a permit for more than 1000 apartments.

Hengyi, a subsidiary of Shandong HYI  Group , a powerful player in  China 's Shandong province, has significant
exposure through two other  residential  projects in Melbourne's CBD.

TD  The  Chinese group  acquired the  site  at 170 Victoria Street from listed Singaporean developer Chip Eng Seng for

$64.8 million last month.

The deal attracted considerable attention in the market. The Singaporean seller doubled its money in just two years
after gaining a planning permit under the previous state government.

A hiatus in the approval of planning permits after the change of government and market uncertainty over how readily
new Planning Minister Richard Wynne will dispense permits have added a premium to good sites with permits.

Chip Eng Seng acquired the corner  site  - a 2927-square-metre parcel of the former Carlton & United brewery - from
Grocon only two years ago for $32 million. Through its Australian subsidiary, CES Victoria, the Singaporeans won
approval for a 72-storey Elenberg Fraser-designed tower comprising 1035 apartments.

The  transaction  is thought to have set a record for the Carlton area, just north of the CBD, with a land rate of just
over $22,000 per square metre.

It was handled by Colliers International's Trent Hobart and Bryson Cameron, who were not available for comment.

Hengyi is embarking on a 607- apartment  project in Elizabeth Street called the Light House. Nearby, it has
redeveloped two neighbouring towers in William Street into  residential  accommodation.
