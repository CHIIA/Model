A DAIRY property south of Hamilton has been acquired by a major Chinese investment group,
heralding a farm spend-up across the Western District.

The $2 million property, located near Branxholme, has been purchased by a subsidiary of the
Bright Food Group, which owns and operates the second-largest dairy network in China.

Tianjin Bright and Meng-De Dairy, which milks over 20,000 cows at its own dairy facilities in
eastern China, confirmed its purchase of the Branxholme property Duncraig on Wednesday.

Lets Go sales and marketing director Jason Hellyer is acting as a spokesman on behalf of the
Chinese agricultural group.

Mr Hellyer said the Branxholme property was set to be one of three to four farms acquired by the
Chinese group.

Its goal is to eventually export livestock to China.

About 700 heifers will initially be run on the property, grown out to 400 kilograms and exported to
restock dairies in China.

"The aspiration is certainly to grow and this is an opportunity to test the waters," Mr Hellyer said.

"It took two-and-a-half years to identify and negotiate this deal (Duncraig), so it has been a long
and very strategic process.

"The plan is to look closely at properties on the market with a view to purchasing three to four
properties.

"Livestock will be bred at the property and exported through the Port of Portland once they are
ready for milk production."

Duncraig covers 900 acres south of Branxholme and was on the market earlier this year with a
$2800-an-acre price tag. It could not be confirmed whether the farm sold for that but the sale
fetched at least $2 million.
