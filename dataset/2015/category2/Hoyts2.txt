LP  BEIJING, June 2 (Reuters) - Wanda Cinema Line Corp , a unit of  China 's leading  property  developer Dalian

Wanda  Group , said it would  buy  Australian cinema chain Hoyts  Group , a  purchase  that underscores its
parent's ambitions to become a global entertainment  company .

Wanda Cinema, in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, did not disclose how much it would pay for Hoyts.

TD  In December,  Chinese  businessman Sun Xishuang, a major shareholder in Dalian Wanda  Commercial

Properties Co and a friend of Wanda  Group  Chairman Wang Jianlin, bought Hoyts from private equity fund
Pacific Equity Partners for an undisclosed sum.

Hoyts operates some 450 cinema screens in Australia. Wanda Cinema currently operates  China 's biggest
theatre chain, with over 150 motion-picture houses in more than 80 cities.

The acquisition is the latest push by Dalian Wanda into entertainment as it seeks to diversify its holdings away
from real  estate .

In February, Dalian Wanda agreed to acquire Swiss sports marketing  firm  Infront Sports & Media AG for 1.05
billion euros ($1.15 billion) after making a 45 million euro investment in Spanish soccer club Atletico Madrid.

In 2013, Dalian Wanda agreed to oversee a 50 billion yuan ($8.07 billion) investment in a movie studio and
entertainment complex in the  Chinese  coastal city Qingdao. A year earlier, it bought AMC Entertainment
Holdings, the second largest U.S. cinema chain, for $2.6 billion. ($1 = 0.9109 euros) ($1 = 6.1980  Chinese
yuan renminbi) (Reporting By Matthew Miller and Shu Zhang; Editing by Miral Fahmy)
