LP  EXCLUSIVE  Chinese  investors are targeting Sydney’s inner south, with an Adina  Hotel  bought for nearly $40

million  while a  residential  development  site  has been snapped up for nearly $50m.

In Mascot, a cashed-up  Chinese  individual has bought the Adina  Hotel , which was developed and is operated
by Toga  Hotels.

TD  The  hotel , which was recently completed, has 123 serviced apartments across seven storeys.

It is close to Sydney Airport and accommodates business travellers. Capital Corporation  sold  the  property , but
the  company  and the agent on the deal, Knight Frank’s Dominic Ong, declined to comment.

Capital Corporation bought the Bourke Street  site , which was then a seven-storey office building, in 2011 for
$29m. The  group  subdivided the  property  into two lots, developing a  hotel  next to the office building.

Capital Corporation made its first profit on the  site  after selling the office building in February for $35m to
technology  company  CR Kennedy, which will house its headquarters on the  site .

At that time, Capital Corporation director Steve Grant said the  group  would use the funds from the  sale  to look
for future development opportunities. The  company  is in the process of developing a project with more than
600 homes in Sydney’s north-western Rouse Hill.

Also in Sydney’s inner south, a private  Chinese  development  group  has bought a 260  apartment site  in
Roseberry.

The 8403sq  m site , at 12-24 Rothchild Avenue, has three street frontages with a development concept scheme
completed by JPR Architects. The private owner of the  property  bought it in 1997 for just $4.5m, and could
earn about $44m from the  sale .

Values in Sydney’s south are being boosted as the area is transformed from an industrial precinct to a trendy
residential  neighbourhood.

Nearby, Mirvac  Group  is the  lead  developer in Sydney’s $8  billion  Green Square precinct, one of Sydney’s
biggest urban regeneration projects. There are 10,000 apartments and 60,000sq  m  of retail space to be built in
the precinct over the next four years.

The  company sold  238 apartments on its Green Square development in the March quarter, with another 224
apartments to come to the market this quarter.

The NSW government is running an expressions of interest campaign to sell its  stake  in Green Square through
JLL, with expectations of reaping more than $100m. Other companies are racing to meet demand for
apartments in the area. Iwan Sunito’s Crown  Group  this year bought a business  park  in Waterloo for $40m
and is said to be planning a $2bn development in the precinct, while  Hong Kong -backed Anson City
Developments recently bought a  site  in Kensington for $40m.

Elsewhere, in Sydney’s north shore,  Chinese  developer Bridgehill has held talks to sell its  site  at 52 Alfred
Street for about $110m to a new buyer, thought to be offshore syndicator known as Bullion Development

build a 220  apartment  project, The Uptown.

The project will be built opposite Roseville College.The six-building development will have an end value of
$200m.
