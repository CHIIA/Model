LP  Australian  commercial property  asset sales to offshore buyers in the first quarter of 2015 were up 58 per cent year

on year, with  Chinese  buyers accounting for most of the uplift.

The value of  commercial property sold  to offshore buyers was more than $1  billion  in the three months to
March, despite the first quarter of the year traditionally being the quietest period for  commercial  investment,
according to realtor LJ Hooker.

TD  Most of the investments were in office  assets  which accounted for more than 90 per cent of the quarter's activity.

Chinese  developers made up 44 per cent of the sales. The next biggest offshore investors came from the US and
Singapore.

The largest foreign  transaction  in the first quarter was not  Chinese  but US  firm  Blackstone's 25 per cent  stake
in 161 Castlereagh Street, Sydney at $240  million  in February, LJ Hooker's national research manager Mathew
Tiller said.

"But the  Chinese  trumped the offshore category last quarter with  China 's Dalian Wanda  Group 's  purchase  of
Gold  Fields House for $425  million ," Mr Tiller said.

The largest  Chinese commercial  deal in the first quarter was Aqualand's $158  million purchase  of 168 Walker
Street in North Sydney.

The trend was also seen in the fourth quarter of 2014 which recorded over $3  billion  in  commercial  sales to
offshore buyers, nearly twice as much as the same quarter in 2013. The  Chinese  were also the main buyers last
quarter.

LJ Hooker said offshore buyers were looking to transform their  purchases , particularly those in CBD locations, into
residential  apartments.

"The pace will continue and in all asset classes across all quality grades from offshore  purchasers ," Ray White
Commercial  Head of Research, Vanessa Rader, said. "Australia is a safe haven for investment and the current
dollar as a lot to do with it."

"It's amazing. Offshore buyers especially from  China  are very aggressive."
