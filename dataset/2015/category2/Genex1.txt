LP  Here is something a bit different for fund managers who reckon they have seen it all in initial public offerings.

Innovative power generation  company  Genex  Energy  is heading for the ASX boards with a project that uses
an old  gold  mine to generate low-cost electricity for the Queensland grid.

TD  One of  China 's largest turbine manufacturers, ZHEFU, is already on board, having just taken a 20 per cent

stake  in Genex.

The infrastructure IPO will use existing assets from the abandoned mine and install a pump storage hydro power
plant. The IPO is underwritten by Brisbane-based broker Morgans and it's understood marketing will start on
Monday. A listing is pegged for the first week in July.

Helmsec's Simon Kidston and Michael Addison, the pair that founded Carabella Resources, are behind the
project. Ralph Craven, a non-executive director at Senex  Energy  and SP AusNet, will chair the board.

Genex's market capitalisation on listing is expected to be $30  million . The IPO is said to have already attracted
a handful of high-profile investors.

It'll be the third-biggest hydro project in Australia and the technology is already proven.

Elsewhere, and as revealed by Street Talk Online, consumer products and kitchen appliances  company  Shriro
is asking potential investors to buy into its $50.5  million  initial public offering at 9.5-times forecast 2015 profit.

Shriro, which is advised by Wilson HTM Corporate Finance and ANZ Securities, is meeting fund managers this
week, seeking support for the  company 's  equity  raising, which is scheduled to close on May 25.

The  company  wants to raise $50.5  million  at $1 a share, which represents 9.5-times pro forma 2015 calendar
year profit. It was also 6.3-times forecast 2015 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation on an
enterprise value-to-EBITDA basis.
