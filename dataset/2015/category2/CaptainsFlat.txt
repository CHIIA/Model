Who owns Australia’s farms? Nation’s biggest landholders revealed | The Weekly Times

• Home-grown owners

Family farm beats foreign

WHO owns Australian farms?

That’s the question on many lips as the debate over foreign investment in Australian agriculture
continues to rage.

The Weekly Times has compiled a list of more than 500 properties and their owners, who range from
family partnership and domestic pastoral groups to international business people and conglomerates.

The big players are a mix of foreign and domestic entities.

With its more than 10 million hectares, Australian pastoral giant S Kidman and Co has the most land.
But foreign funds such as US teacher superannuation entity TIA-CREFF are rapidly building a profile
with a reported investment of $1 billion in prime farming country.

The list provides a platform for debate about investment in Australian agriculture. Where is it needed
and where should it come from?
