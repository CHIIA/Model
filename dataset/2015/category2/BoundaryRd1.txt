East Melbourne

TD  A shop in a tightly held retail pocket of East Melbourne has  sold  for $3.025 million. The 193-square-metre  site
with a six-metre frontage to Wellington Parade and 28 metres to Simpson Street attracted 120 inquiries, Savills
Australia's Nick Peden and Jesse Radisich and MGO  Property 's Martin O'Halloran said. The two-level building,
with a shop and office on the ground floor and an office upstairs, was fully leased to two tenants at a total
income of $95,576 net. "East Melbourne retail in this precinct is relatively scarce and, as such, highly valued and
tightly held," Mr Peden said.

Hampton

A two-level shop and residence at the beach end at 390-392 Hampton Street has  sold  on a low 4.1 per cent
yield at auction. On five separate titles, the building's five tenancies provide an annual rental income of
$112,285, conjunctional agents DBRE and Buxtons said. "The vendor accepted the final bid in the high $2
million range from a local private investor whose intention is to look to redeveloping the upper floors in the
future," DBRE's James Davie said.

Carlton

A securely leased ground-floor strata shop metres from Lygon Street  sold  for $1.925 million, representing a
tight yield of 4.6 per cent, Morley  Commercial 's James Lie said. The shop at 186 Faraday Street was leased to
Et Al, a prominent Australian fashion  company  with five stores, for $89,989 per annum, plus GST, he said.

Abbotsford

A local developer outbid offshore buyers to nab a $5.04 million development  site  in Hoddle Street. The
property  on the corner at 218-228 Hoddle Street, which had two street frontages, had been used as a
showroom, Savills Australia's Nick Peden and Jesse Radisich said. "We were expecting a little over $3.5 million.
The strong competition from both local and offshore interests put its value at another level, perhaps reflecting
some hope that the  site  may see a  residential  rezoning in the not too distant future," Mr Peden said. The main
portion of the  property  facing Hoddle Street was  sold  with vacant possession.

Laverton North

Strengthening demand from owner-occupiers wanting to gain a foothold in Melbourne's western industrial
precinct has underpinned more than $12 million in sales over the past two months.  Chinese -based consortium
Forte Land secured a 7462-square-metre industrial facility at 197-205 Boundary Road in Laverton North for
about $6 million with impending occupation for a related entity, CBRE's Harry Kalaitzis and Todd Grima said. In
another deal, National Auto Glass Supplies acquired a 4008-square-metre, speculatively built facility at 31 Benn
Court within the Westpark Industrial  Estate  in Derrimut for $3.78 million. Meanwhile, South Melbourne-based
business The Car Brokers bought a 2360-square-metre facility at 2/405 Grieve Parade in Altona North for $2.42
million. The  property  comprises a modern two-level office/showroom/warehouse, internal clearances of 10
metres and four container-height roller doors.
