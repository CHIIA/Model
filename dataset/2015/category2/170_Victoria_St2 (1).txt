LP  Developers are swooping on  apartment  sites in Sydney and Melbourne with deals struck that will see Iwan Sunito’s

Crown  Group  and  China ’s Hengyi build about 2000 new apartments in each city.

Crown, which yesterday unveiled its latest luxury development in Sydney’s inner west, the $88 million  residential
tower Crown Ashfield, has secured two sites in Waterloo and is close to taking full control of the Eastlakes Shopping
Centre  site  in Botany.

TD  These moves will add about 1200 apartments to the  group ’s pipeline, which includes a project in the city’s Green

Square.

Crown  Group  project sales manager Anthony Falas said there was a rising demand for high-end apartments in
Ashfield where the 79 apartments will start at $700,000. At Eastlakes, Crown  Group  will build above the shopping
centre as it did in its Top Ryde project in Sydney.

Mr Falas said the  group  was buying out partner Proshka from the $500m development. “It will be ours by the time
we launch.” He said Crown had a stronghold in Green Square and was still interested in the Sydney CBD.

Hengyi, an affiliate of mainland  Chinese  player Shandong HYI, has emerged as the buyer of an inner city  site
sold  by Chip Eng Seng through Colliers.Hengyi, which is undertaking two Melbourne towers already, is buying 8
Bouverie Street, and could develop more than 1000 apartments. The 2927sq m parcel is mainly vacant land and a
72-storey, 1035  apartment  high rise development is permitted.
