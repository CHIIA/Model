LP  It's been 10 days since bidders tabled a binding offer for the Port of Darwin's 99-year lease and so far it's been

all quiet on the Northern (Territory) front.

However, the key players won't have to wait long for news - Street Talk understands a preferred bidder will be
selected early this week.

TD  JP Morgan -advised Port of Brisbane and a Macquarie Capital-advised grouping of Colonial First State and

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management remain in the race.

As Street Talk revealed late last month, private  Chinese  group Landbridge also tabled a final offer for the $300
million -plus asset.

While a decision had not been made as of Sunday, sources noted Port of Brisbane is seen as the logical
acquirer because it has a good read on Darwin port's key markets.

Flagstaff Partners is selling the lease for the Port of Darwin on behalf of the Northern Territory government.

Elsewhere, deal-hungry equities desks don't need an invitation to test the waters for an  equity  capital markets
trade.

And so it was at the weekend, with certain funds understood to have been asked at what price and on what
terms they would be willing to throw fresh funds into  oil  producer Santos.

It looks like a small window has opened for Santos. The resurgent  oil  price - which in Australian dollar terms
bottomed about three weeks ago - and Origin  Energy  flying after announcing its $2.5  billion  recapitalisation
have equities desks confident they could get a deal done for Santos.

Of course, the Santos faithful had been waiting for the  company  to finalise some asset sales (final bids for
most of the portfolios up for grabs went in on October 7) before tapping  equity  markets for fresh funds.
However, with the window opening, some are now tipping a $1.5  billion  deal ahead of the sales. Whether an
equity  deal happens is another matter. But there is no doubt Santos has more capital options today than it did
last week, last month or even last quarter.

Deutsche Bank is advising Santos on its options, alongside Lazard , and would be expected to be involved in
any  equity  deal. Other banks also would be keen to run the trade, including the likes of Morgan Stanley and
Citi.

Interestingly, Santos is believed to have closed the data room for the  sale  of its assets in Vietnam, Malaysia
and Indonesia. Sources said Blackstone -backed Tamarind  Energy  was still around the portfolio but only at
below the touted price of $500  million  to $700  million .

Santos shares closed at $5.97.

Finally, graphite play Magnis Resources will announce on Monday it is raising $4  million  at 40¢ a share to fund
the next stage of its development.
