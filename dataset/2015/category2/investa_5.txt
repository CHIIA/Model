LP  Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing has repatriated more than $1.2 billion after selling almost $2.5bn worth of

office towers out of the Investa Property Group empire, and is edging closer to exiting the entire business.

Investa’s accounts reveal the big ticket item was the sale of 11  office assets to China Investment Corporation for
$2.455bn, with the $340m sale of the Investa Land to Proprium Capital Partners adding to the pot.

TD  Morgan Stanley and UBS handled the sales.

Only the sale of the management business remains. Morgan Stanley last month agreed to a term sheet
proffered by the unlisted Investa Commercial Property Fund to acquire its management platform for $110m-
$120m.

It remains unclear whether the listed Investa Office Fund will participate in that deal as it weighs up its own
future. The ultimate management of the CIC portfolio is also unclear but neither deal will significantly shift the
numbers for the vendor.

The fund through which Morgan Stanley holds its stake in Investa last month repatriated $1.205bn of sales
proceeds from the office tower sales to its offshore parent. This came after the repayment of $701.9m of
shareholder loans, the redemption of $351.1m of loan notes and a capital reduction of $152.2m.

Investa made a $93.5m profit for the year, driven by $286.3m in portfolio revaluations, perhaps reflecting the
sharp near 5 per cent yield on the CIC deal.

The accounts also show the record-breaking deal only went some way to trimming losses  suffered by Morgan
Stanley funds. They poured $3bn of equity into Investa and were sitting on about $1.1bn of losses at the end of
June.

While Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the accounts, its return to profit over the past two years lends
credence to the thesis of American real estate executive Scott MacDonald’s forthcoming book, Saving Investa.

Due to be released in March, the book bills Investa’s well-regarded management team as the chief architects of
the group’s turnaround after the global financial crisis.

While losses were sustained from Morgan Stanley’s $6.6bn boomtime acquisition of Investa, the group’s
management has won plaudits for restricting, stabilising and expanding the business.Their future will be
determined by what happens to Investa Office Management, a near $400m  enterprise once $200m-plus stakes
in IOF and a $40m-plus stake in ICPF are taken into  account.
