EG and China's Forte strike major partnership

Real estate manager EG Funds Management has joined forces with Forte, afﬁliated
with major Chinese conglomerate Fosun, for three major development projects in

Sydney and Brisbane with an end value of $650 million. 

Forte has acquired a 75 percent stake for just over $100 million in EG's projects at Five
Dock and Auburn in Sydney and Fortitude Valley in Brisbane. It is the Chinese group's
ﬁrst investment in Australia, and combined, the developments will provide 1000 new
homes. 

Adam Geha, chief executive of EG, said the group would retain the remaining interest
in the projects and work alongside Forte as an equity partner. The deal was brokered
by Colliers International. 

"Forte are highly knowledgeable and capable developers and we will collaborate to
continue to signiﬁcantly improve these developments," Adam Geha said.

EG has seven projects in Australia with a pipeline of approximately 2500 units over
the next four years. 

Expressions of Interest

"We took a view that we would canvass China on a regular basis to secure a joint
venture partner who was also thinking long-term about Australia," Mr Geha said.

EG will be the development and project manager for the three sites, and they will still
be held in EG's Yield Plus Infrastructure Fund.

The chairman of Forte, which was purchased by Fosun several years ago,
foreshadowed further overseas investment.

overseas investment," Zhihua Chen said.

"During the development process, Forte and EG will combine expertise to develop
better products. In the meantime, Forte will also gradually increase its overseas
investment scale."

20 real estate developer in 2015.
