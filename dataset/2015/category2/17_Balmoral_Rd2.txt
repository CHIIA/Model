A CHINESE mining company has paid $43.7 million for two prime residential hectares in Kellyville — one of
the biggest sales in the suburb.
The land at 17 Balmoral Rd has approval for 290 units and was sold by local construction company Bathla
Group. Alex Mirzaian from CBRE, who negotiated the deal, said it represents one of the highest prices paid
per unit for a DA approved site in the area.
“It is always going to be more profitable to build the site than to sell it but in this instance the uplift in the
margin was too good to refuse,’’ he said.
Negotiations on the sale took two months with Bathla Group deciding to sell the land rather than take on the
building project.
It is believe the Girraween-based company purchased the land 18 months ago for around $20 million.
The name of the mining company has not been released. It is believed, however, they have already started
selling the units off the plan following settling on the deal at the end of last year. The site, which has a R4
High Density Residential zoning is located close to the $8.3 billion Sydney Metro Northwest line – 1km to the
future Kellyville train station and 650m to Bella Vista station.

...
“I know of a couple in North Kellyville that have been purchased and conceptual designs have been done,
but now the rates for subdivision lots and houses are increasing they are considering selling the sites as
well,’’ he said.According...sale in Kellyville is $61.3 million, paid for 8039sqm on Windsor Rd in 2010.
