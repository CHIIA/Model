LP  2303 GMT -- Goldman Sachs welcomes the end to speculation about Santos Ltd .'s (STO.AU) financial health

with an upgrade to neutral from sell. On Monday, the Australian oil and gas producer unveiled a package of
measures to raise 3.5 billion Australian dollars ($2.46 billion). They comprised the A$520 million sale of a gas
field to Japan's Mitsui, a A$2.5 billion share issue to existing investors and a A$500 million placement to
Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital . "By our estimates, the amount raised looks sufficient to bring Santos's
credit metrics back to consistency with BBB credit metrics on our oil deck (and also looks sufficient on $50/bbl
flat)," analyst Mark Wiseman says. The broker lifts its price target by 24% to A$4.95/share. STO last traded at
A$5.91. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
