LP  Chinese  state-owned  company  Zijin  Mining  Group Co. Ltd. has again upped its bid for the remaining  stake

in ASX-listed Norton  Gold  Fields Ltd., according to a May 26 statement.

Zijin subsidiary Jinyu (H.K.) International  Mining  Co. Ltd., which holds an 82.43% interest, is now offering 25
Australian cents per share; a 2-cent-per-share hike on its previous offer.

TD  It is the second time Jinyu has had to raise its offer from an initial 20 cents per share to gain traction with

shareholders.

The original deal was valued at about A$33  million  for the remaining 17.57% interest Jinyu does not already
own. The higher price now values that  stake  at A$40.9  million .

Norton said the latest increase in price comes on the back of talks with certain parties who agreed to tender their
shares to the offer at the new price.

Zijin also made it clear the revised offer is its best and final price, according to Norton.

Shareholders will be given the opportunity to vote on the proposed takeover at a June 12 meeting. Norton
previously pushed back the shareholder meeting to gain greater support for the takeover.
