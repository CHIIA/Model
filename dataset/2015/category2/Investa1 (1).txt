LP  $2bn MYOB IPO biggest so far Four investment banks and a raft of other advisers, such as lawyers and

accountants, will split a pool of fees worth as much as $41.1  million  for the $2  billion  float of accounting software
firm  MYOB in what is the largest initial public offering so far for 2015.

MYOB will list at between $3 and $4 per share with its market capitalisation at between $1.9bn to $2.26bn when it
lists on May 4.

TD  According to the prospectus, released yesterday, the four joint  lead  managers, which include Goldman Sachs ,

UBS , Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi, are entitled to a base fee of 1.9 per cent of the proceeds raised.

The  company  said it may elect to pay the joint  lead  managers an incentive fee of 0.85 per cent of the total offer
proceeds “at its discretion”.

It would also reimburse the joint  lead  managers their costs. Other advisers on the deal include financial adviser
Reunion Capital, law  firm  Clayton Utz, and PricewaterhouseCoopers , among others.

MYOB’s enterprise value will be between $2.34bn to $2.7bn.

The book build will be held on April 29 and 30 as vendor Bain Capital moves to raise between $831.7m to $833.8m.

The deal equates to between 14.5 times and 16.8 times MYOB’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation for its 2016 annual earnings or 24.9 times pro forma net profit after tax and amortisation for the fiscal
year to June 2016.

US private  equity  giant Bain Capital is not selling any of its MYOB shares through the offer, and will continue to
hold at least 56.75 per cent post-IPO.

Bain had acquired MYOB for about $1.2bn in 2011 from Australian private  equity firm  Archer Capital .

MYOB provides tax accounting and other services to small-to-medium businesses. It is the largest player in the
Australian accounting software market for small and medium enterprises.

The Melbourne-based  company  is one of the largest providers of desktop and cloud business management
software in Australia and New Zealand, employing over 1100 people and serving over 1.2 business customers.

Chinese  bidder arrives As the first round of bidding for Morgan Stanley ’s $8.9  billion  Investa Property Group
nears a conclusion, a colossal  Chinese  life insurance  firm , Ping An, has emerged as a serious contender for the
real estate empire.

The insurer,  China ’s second largest by market share, is widely viewed as one of the most aggressive suitors for
Investa given its sheer scale and track record of snapping up iconic property assets.

In 2013 Ping An, which has total assets of over US$461  billion , bought the iconic Lloyd’s of London building,
marking its first offshore  purchase , and followed that up with Tower Place in the capital.

The  company  is currently vying with Fosum, another  Chinese  behemoth, for a US$1.6  billion  portfolio of
buildings in the centre of Berlin as it seeks out relatively high-yielding blue-chip property assets. Ping An has
previously stated it will consider teaming up with partners to explore opportunities, although it has no fixed
acquisition  strategy and it remains unclear how it will structure an offer for Investa, which is selling a $2.5bn
portfolio of balance sheet assets, that include stakes in some of Australia’s most recognisable skyscrapers, like
Deutsche Bank Place, as well as a management platform.

As The Australian reported last month, over 40 contenders have so far filed through the data room, with several
listed domestic groups, including, Charter Hall, GPT Group and Dexus squaring up against long list of international
names such as the US real estate giant, CBRE, alternative asset manager, Blackstone, Canada’s Brookfield,
Chinese  conglomerate Fosun and La Salle Investment Management.

However, one of the most acquisitive offshore investors, Canada’s massive Pension Plan Investment Board, has
opted to steer clear of the auction.

Morgan Stanley acquired Investa at the peak of the last credit cycle and called in UBS last year to help advise on
the  sale  of the business — a move first revealed by this newspaper.

It is understood that Investa’s advisers, along with its  management team, will travel to Morgan Stanley ’s head office
in New York within the next two weeks to present a short-list of contenders.

Sources claimed Ping An may opt to submit a bid on its own and but the entire group outright,  giving it control over
the listed  Investa Office Fund , along with its unlisted stablemate, ICPF, or strike a partnership deal with an
Australian or Asian manager.

Alternatively Ping An may join a consortium and seek to take control of a handful of the assets from the balance
sheet.

Chinese  Life Insurers spent a combined $15  billion  on offshore property last year after the  government relaxed
regulations limiting the sector from making international acquisitions in 2012.

The volume of purchases that have been made since then have led some to predict the mainland insurers will
repeat the same large scale incursions made by the Japanese throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Strong IPO conditions TouchCorp’s strong start to its life as a listed  company  yesterday has reinforced the strength
of the Australian sharemarket conditions for initial public offerings.

Shares in digital payments system  company  closed nearly 11 per cent higher on its ASX debut, underlining the
strong investor demand for technology stocks.

TouchCorp shares rose as much as 16 per cent in intraday trade but settled at $1.55 by close, up 10.7 per cent from
the issue price. Around 6.5  million  shares, or nearly 6 per cent of the  company ’s  equity , changed hands on the
ASX on Tuesday.

The IPO raised $56  million  through a combination of  sale  of existing shares and issue of new shares.

All shares were issued at $1.40 each, giving the  company  a market value of $162m on listing.

TouchCorp focuses on the retailing sector, with its Touch System software allowing retailers to sell third party
products by connecting retailers with the third party service providers.

The deal comes as technology  company  Aeeris Limited , will debut on the ASX on Wednesday, after raising $3.5
million  through an IPO. Aeeris, which operates a location-based weather and hazards early warning service,
issued shares at 25c each.
