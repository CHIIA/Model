LP  Landmark development  site  sales in Sydney are heating up, with Toga believed to be a leading bidder for the

William Inglis & Son stables in the eastern suburbs, while Greenland Holding  Group  is preparing an aggressive
offer for a Pyrmont  property  partly owned by billionaire media mogul Kerry Stokes.

Toga, thought to be partnering with Far East Hospitality, is said to have made an offer near $260 million for the Inglis
site , which will accommodate about 700 dwellings, sources says.

TD  It is understood that  Chinese  developers Shimao  Property , Aqualand and Fosun are no longer in the running for

the Randwick  site , which is expected to yield a landmark project.

The 4.45ha holding has been owned by the family since 1906 and was the headquarters of thoroughbred  company
William Inglis & Son.

The family this month finally received approval from the NSW Planning and Environment Department to rezone the
site .

Bowing to community pressure, NSW Planning has also ruled that at least 5000sq m of open space on the stables
site  be quarantined for a  park .

The department has approved townhouses,  apartment  towers, villas and shops for the  property .

Randwick Mayor Ted Seng has attacked the NSW Planning decision, recently telling The Australian that community
concerns about traffic congestion and density had not been allayed.

Toga development director Fabrizio Perilli and the agents marketing the  property , Colliers International’s Jon
Chomley and Robert McCuaig, declined to comment last night.

Closer to the CBD, Greenland is thought to be in hot pursuit of the Revy 8 building, which is being  sold  by a
consortium of owners, led by developer Citta  Property Group  and including Seven West Media.

The heritage-listed building, next to the Seven Network studios on Darling  Island , will be  sold  with approval for a
$150m luxury  apartment  project. The winning bid is expected to be higher than $50m, with the expressions of
interest to close today.

Greenland is understood be in favour of the project’s luxury element and the fact that it is already approved for
development.Only one of the three historic buildings on the  site  — not those currently occupied by Seven — is
being  sold . Greenland and the agents on the  sale , CBRE’s Matt Ramsay, Peter Krieg and Justin Brown, declined
to comment.
