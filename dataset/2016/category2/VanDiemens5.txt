LP  A  Chinese  businessman who took over Australia’s largest blind maker, Kresta, will be the new owner of the

nation’s largest  dairy  if he can clear legal and foreign  investment hurdles.

Kresta’s new owner in  dairy  bid

TD  Multiple sources have confirmed that Lu Xianfeng, whose Ningbo Xianfeng New  Material Co Ltd bought 85 per

cent of  Kresta Blinds last year, is the successful bidder for Tasmania’s Van Diemen’s Land Co.

But Mr Lu, who last night confirmed he had offered $280  million  to VDL, which has 25  dairy  farms in
Tasmania’s far northwest, cannot complete the  sale  until court action launched by a rival local bidder is
concluded.

TasFoods Ltd, representing a consortium of wealthy local  businesspeople including Kathmandu founder Jan
Cameron, and Australian institutional investors, has obtained an injunction in  Victoria’s Supreme Court
preventing the  sale  of VDL to Mr Lu.

It had signed a  sale  agreement for VDL earlier this month and believes  it has been unfairly “gazumped ” by
VDL’s New Zealand owners, the New Plymouth  District Council, selling to Mr Lu two weeks later.

An interim injunction obtained by TasFoods has been extended to next week, while the court ordered VDL to
provide  TasFoods with  details of the  sale  agreement with its  Chinese  rival.

After inquiries from The Australian, Mr Lu last night confirmed he had bought VDL through Moon Lake
Investments, set up by him for that purpose.

“Mr Lu intends to work with the existing management of the Tasmanian  dairy  asset to continue gains in
productivity while continuing to supply fresh  milk  to the local Tasmanian market,” a spokesman said.

He had offered VDL’s owners $280m cash, including a $20m  deposit, and a commitment to  expansion of the
business .

The identity of the successful buyer had been kept secret by VDL and its owners, who have disclosed only that it
is a foreign entity and will require Foreign Investment Review  Board  approval. TasFoods chairman Rob Woolley
has characterised the battle for the giant  dairy , which dates to the 1820s, as being between a local  company
wanting to invest in premium products and a foreign buyer with unknown intent.

However, The Australian  understands Mr Lu and his  company , which for a time considered bidding for the
$350m Kidman and Co cattle and pastoral empire, will argue that they plan to expand  operations at VDL, which
includes the historic Woolnorth  property , and retain local jobs.

As VDL has always been foreign-owned it is not expecting any significant obstacle from the FIRB.

The 45-year-old,  Chinese -born Mr Lu and his Ningbo Xianfeng Co, which is also known as APLUS, came to
the attention of Australians last year when he launched his successful takeover of Kresta. APLUS claims to be
China ’s leading manufacturer of indoor and outdoor sunscreen blinds, used in large office and  commercial
buildings.

Mr Lu, Kresta’s managing  director, is understood to have other  business  interests in  China  and Australia and
Ningbo Xianfeng is believed to be keen to  secure cattle or  dairy assets  in Australia.
