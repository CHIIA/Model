One-time iron ore hopeful Cazaly Resources has sold out of one historic gold district and moved
into a new one.
Just days after China’s Hanking paid Cazaly $220,000 for strategic mining tenements near
Southern Cross, Cazaly’s joint managing director Nathan McMahon yesterday announced the
takeover of private exploration company Yamarna West.

Cazaly will pick up exploration licence application E38/3111, which covers nearly 200sqkm along
the Mt Venn greenstone belt.
The belt is an offshoot of the Yamarna shear zone, which hosts Gold Road Resources’ 6.16Moz
Gruyere discovery, 200km east of Laverton.

“It is rare to secure such a large land position in an area rapidly becoming known as a world-class
gold camp,” Mr McMahon said.

There has been little systematic exploration at Mt Venn, with just 15 reverse circulation, 74 aircore
and 86 rotary air blast holes drilled within the entire licence area.
Cazaly has paid $15,000 for the exclusive two-month option to purchase all the shares in
Yamarna West. The acquisition, if exercised, is for 2.5 million Cazaly shares, worth $200,000 at
yesterday’s closing price of 8 cents.
The vendors will also receive 2.5 million options exercisable at double the price of the initial
shares with an expiry date three years from issue. Another 2.5 million options will be exercisable
at three times the price within four years.
The refocus on gold and lithium assets comes after Cazaly’s Parker Range iron ore project near
Southern Cross was approved in 2012.
