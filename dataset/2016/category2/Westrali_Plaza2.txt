INTRODUCTION

Colliers International is pleased to present our valued clients with the 2016 
Capital Markets Office Year in Review. 
The  Australian  commercial  market  has  experienced  another  strong  year  of 
office  investment  with transaction volumes totalling  approximately  $8  billion 
over the  calendar  year.  Once  again  we  have  witnessed  an  influx  of  foreign 
capital to our shores, which is a testament to Australia’s economic strength, 
political stability and world class commercial asset quality. 

Leading  market  indicators  are  pointing  to  another  bountiful  year  ahead  for 
prospective investors, with yield spreads suggesting there remains scope for 
further cap rate compression, and strong employment conditions supporting 
revenue streams in key markets. Combined, these factors should encourage 
ongoing investment from both domestic and foreign capital sources.   

2016 was a record-breaking year for our Capital Markets business, as the team 
successfully leveraged into the high level of Australian market activity. In 2017, 
we  will  endeavour to  not  only  focus  on transactions,  but  continue to  create 
unique relationship that will produce lasting value for our clients. 

We trust you find the 2016 Year in Review an insightful read and thank you for 
your continued support.

2016 YEAR IN REVIEW

Australian Safe Harbour 
It’s safe to say that 2016 has dealt its fair share 
of  economic  shocks  to  the  global  economy, 
with the standouts being Britain’s referendum 
to  leave  the  European  Union  (Brexit)  and  a 
pending Trump presidency. And while we don’t 
want to weigh into any political debate, these 
economic  shocks  further  cement  Australia’s 
position as an appealing global destination for 
foreign capital deployment. Australia has, and 
will continue to resonate with foreign investors 
due to our consistent economic growth through 
cycles,  transparent  financial  system  together 
with sound political and legal frameworks. 
Monetary policy and interest rates
2016 was characterised by record low interest 
rates  both  globally  and  domestically.  The 
issuance of negative yielding government bonds 
in  Asia  and  Europe  spurred  the  global  hunt 
for  yield  throughout  the  year,  with  Australian 
commercial  property  assets  becoming  even 
more  appealing  in  terms  of  risk  adjusted 
returns. Cuts to Australia’s official cash rate in 
May and August saw our domestic benchmark 
fall  to  a  record  low  of  1.5  per  cent,  ensuring 
that  commercial  property  also  retained  its 
appeal  with  domestic  investors.  Importantly, 
the implementation of regulatory measures has 
allowed the RBA to focus its monetary policy 
strategy  on  economic  objectives  while  also 
addressing fears of an overheating residential 
housing  market.  Looking  forward,  the  central 
bank now has room to move lower if required, 
although officials appear content with current 
monetary  policy  settings  according  to  recent 
commentary.

Capital Markets – Australian Office  |  2016 Infrastructure 
investment has 
played a large 
role over the year, 
which bodes well 
for all commercial 
property asset 
classes.

Leasing markets
Leasing markets in both Sydney and Melbourne 
have  performed  exceptionally  well,  supported 
by  white  collar  employment  growth,  falling 
vacancy,  rising  net  effective  rents  and 
restricted  supply  pipelines.  In  the  twelve 
months through to September 2016, Sydney’s 
premium  net  effective  rents  have  increased 
a staggering 28.4 per cent, far exceeding the 
ten year historical annual average growth rate 
of  4.7  per  cent.  Meanwhile  A  and  B  grade 
net  effective  rents  increased  27.8  and  33.7 
per  cent  respectively  over  the  same  period. 
Growth  rates  in  the  secondary  market  were 
strongly  influenced  by  stock  withdrawals  due 
to infrastructure projects and conversions.
CBD Infrastructure
Infrastructure  investment  has  played  a  large 
role  over  the  year,  which  bodes  well  for  all 
commercial  property  asset  classes.  Over  the 
next four years, New South Wales and Victoria 
will  see  a  record  $110  billion  of  combined 
infrastructure  investment  which  will  play  a 
leading role in propelling Australia’s commercial 
property  market  forward.  With  a  variety  of 
metro and light rail projects underway in both 
Sydney  and  Melbourne,  these  CBD  office 
markets have become even more appealing to 
businesses and their employees which in turn 
creates tailwinds for investment markets.

QUICK RECYCLING

Capital partnering continues to be a theme for 
core  office  investment,  with  two  major  deals 
nationally acquired in 50:50 deal structures -  
1 Shelley Street, Sydney & Southgate Complex, 
Melbourne.

Examples of assets being purchased and sold 
within 12 to 18 months include:
•  210-220  George  Street,  Sydney  was 
acquired  in  2015  for  a  combined  total  of 
approx $100 million and sold in 2016 for a 
total of approx $160 million. 
114 William Street, Melbourne was acquired 
for $125 million in 2015 and sold in 2016 for

2016 

highlighted 

Largest deal
The  two  major  transactions  in  the  Sydney 
market 
the 
resurgence of domestic capital. Fortius Funds 
Management’s sale of their 75 per cent interest 
in 420 George St to Investa Property Group for 
$442.5  million  was  an  indication  of  domestic 
wholesale  investors’  endorsement  of  current 
market metrics. Charter Hall Core Plus Office 
Fund’s  $525  million  purchase  of  1  Shelley 
Street in conjunction with Morgan Stanley Real 
Estate Investing marked the largest transaction 
of 2016, and was another demonstration of the 
strength of the domestic capital market.
Investors capitalise on strong 
market conditions
The weight of Sydney’s market conditions has 
seen numerous owners recycling assets after 
short  holding  periods.  In  July,  Anton  Capital 
successfully divested 210 & 220 George Street 

for  $160  million  to  Poly  Group,  after  having 
acquired it in 2015 for $99.2 million. Similarly, 
EG Funds Management’s $52.2 million sale of 
92 Pitt St to City Freeholds came after acquiring 
in 2015 for $30.6 million. Both sales were driven 
by the  key  Sydney themes  of  competition  for 
longer term development sites, and shortage of 
existing B grade accommodation.
Leasing outlook to drive further 
yield compression
While  2016  has  seen  continuing  cap  rate 
compression  across  Sydney  transactions,  the 
health of Sydney’s leasing market continues to 
provide buyers with confidence in the forward 
income outlook. With A Grade Year-to-date Net 
Effective Rental Growth of 27.8 per cent to Sep-
16, the market has confidence that while entry 
pricing  is  high,  the  leasing  market  conditions 
will support their underwriting. 

SYDNEY

The Sydney market 
across 2016 has 
been characterised 
by a surge in capital 
values against 
the backdrop of 
an unprecedented 
leasing market. 
While transaction 
volumes have 
trended lower from 
2015, competition 
has only intensified.

sustained 

Sustained high transaction 
volumes
high 
Melbourne  witnessed 
transaction  volumes  in  2016  with  a  total  of 
approx.  $3.05  billion*  in  office  transactions 
($50 million plus) following on from 2014 and 
2015  which  saw  $2.9  billion  and  $2.6  billion 
transacted  respectively.  A  large  portion  of 
2016  sales  volume  (approx.  $1.2  billion)  was 
accounted for in the Southbank precinct as core 
investors turned their  attention to  large  scale 
assets outside the traditional CBD grid. These 
deals  included  75  Dorcas  Street,  Twenty8 
Freshwater Place, Southgate Complex and 12 
Riverside Quay.

Offshore groups continue to 
dominate Melbourne landscape
Following on from 2015 which saw the highest 
volumes  of  offshore  capital  in  Melbourne’s 
history  with  approx.  $2.1  billion,  offshore 
groups  continued to  dominate the transaction 
landscape  purchasing  10  out  of  14  assets 
traded. Once again a total of approx. $2.1 billion 
in offshore capital was deployed in 2016. 
Largest deal 
Suntec  REIT  and  Peninsula 
Investment 
Partners through ARA Investment Management 
made the largest transaction of the year with 
its  acquisition  of  the  Southgate  Complex  in 
Southbank  from  Dexus  Property  for  $578 
million.  The  origin  of  capital  for  this  deal 
emanated from Singapore and Korea.

Australian investors most active 
on the sell side
Australian  based  investors  were  most  prolific 
on the  sell  side  divesting  10  out  of  14  assets 
representing 78 per cent of total sales volume. 
Lendlease was the most active group through 
their divestment of 825 Bourke Street and the 
soon to be developed One Melbourne Quarter 
and  839  Collins  Street,  all  in  the  Docklands 
precinct.  
Offshore groups trading out of 
assets
Following  a  strong  period  of  acquisition 
from  2010  through  2015,  offshore  investors 
capitalised  on  the  strong  market  conditions 
and  divested  out  of  their  investments.  These 
transactions 
Invesco’s  divestment 
of  380  LaTrobe  Street  for  $176.5  million  and 
Straits  Real  Estate  trading  out  of  114  William 
Street for $161.5 million.

BRISBANE

Improving occupier market 
driving increased counter-
cyclical transactions
Brisbane’s  occupier  market  has  begun 
to  show  signs  of  recovery  with  above 
average  net  absorption  for  the  Brisbane 
CBD  in  2016  (Six  month  net  absorption 
in  the  Brisbane  CBD  to  July  2016  was 
very  strong  at  44,634m²*).  2016  has 
seen  186,684m²**  of  additional  stock  to 
the Brisbane CBD prime grade market as 
a  result  of  the  completions  of  1  William 

Street,  480  Queen  Street  and  180  Ann 
Street.  Limited  forecast  supply,  coupled 
with forecast withdrawals in 2017 - as a 
result of demolitions for the construction 
of  the  Queens  Wharf  Integrated  Casino 
Precinct  -  will  see vacancy  stabilise  and 
drop to the end of 2017 which will be the 
catalyst for driving effective rental growth.  

Signs  of  recovery  in  the  tenant  market 
prompted counter-cyclical sale transaction 
activity in the secondary grade market with 
333  Adelaide  Street,  444  Queen  Street 

and 348 Edward Street all trading, and 316 
Adelaide Street currently on-market. 
Offshore capital dominating  
buy-side demand 
Offshore capital, increasingly being represented 
by  domestic  asset  managers,  has  dominated 
buy-side of Brisbane sales landscape in 2016.  
Offshore capital was behind three of the four 
Brisbane  CBD  office  transactions  over  $100 
million  in  2016,  and  also  behind  307  Queen 
Street currently in due diligence. The greatest 
depth  of  capital  is  currently  emanating  from 
USA, Germany, Singapore and South Africa.

Increased buy-side capital 
demand attracted to yield 
arbitrage  
Over recent years Brisbane has become much 
more  widely  accepted  as  a  core  market  for 
investment  by  both  domestic  and  offshore 
institutional  capital.    Driven  in  part  by  the 
substantial  yield  arbitrage  available  between 

Brisbane and the Australian gateway cities of 
Sydney  and  Melbourne.  Limited  investment 
supply  and  heightened  competition  in  both 
Sydney and Melbourne, is also driving capital 
demand for Brisbane.  A case study of three 
comparable  A-grade  sale 
in 
2016 shows a 100 basis point yield arbitrage 
available in Brisbane, well above historic levels.

CANBERRA

Secure government tenant lease 
profile fuels demand
in  other  Eastern 
The  shortage  of  stock 
Seaboard  markets  coupled  with  the  security 
and  stability  of  government  tenants  in  the 
Canberra market has seen transaction volumes 
increase for the sixth year in a row. 

A-REITs  have  been  net  sellers  while 
syndicators,  high  net  worth  privates  and 
off-shore  buyers  seek  either  stable  core  or 
manage to core investments. Local purchasers 
have been active making a number of counter 
cyclical ‘value add’ acquisitions. 

Long term leased assets have been attractive 
in the current economic climate due to tenant 
security,  growth  profiles  and  comparatively 
strong  returns.  Four  assets  with  government 
tenants  sold  in  2016,  with  another  four 
exchanged  or  in  due  diligence.  Yields  have 
remained  stable  throughout  2016  and  are 
expected to remain steady into 2017, as buyer 
side  demand  outstrips  supply  across  the 
eastern seaboard.  
Domestic investors most active
Domestic investors have been the most active 
in  the  Canberra  market,  with  syndicates  and 
high  net  worth  private  investors  being  the 

main  buyers.  Offshore  purchasers  have  been 
active, with interest in most major campaigns, 
although have been struggling to find assets of 
sufficient scale or WALE. 

By  the  end  of  2016  we  anticipate  a  total  of 
$460 million to have transacted with a further 
four assets currently on the market. There are a 
number of assets already tabled for campaigns 
in Q1 2017. The Canberra market is expected 
to remain stable with strong levels of buy-side 
demand continuing.

Capital Markets – Australian Office  |  2016 ADELAIDE

The  Adelaide  CBD  office  market  has  seen 
yields  compress  over the  last  12  months,  but 
not to the same levels as seen in most eastern 
markets. 

This  is  a  reflection  of  the  weaker  leasing 
market  that  has  seen  vacancy  move  higher 
over the  year.  Prime  assets  which  have  long 
lease  terms  and  no  vacancy  are  expected  to 
see  yields  below  7  per  cent,  but  if  the  asset 
has  any  vacancy  or  shorter  lease  terms,  this 
has been reflected in the yield. All of the major 
sales this year have seen yields in the 7 to 8 
per cent range.

The  source  of  capital  has  been  mostly  from 
Australian  sources  with  a  mix  of  private 
investors, and institution investors purchasing 
in the Adelaide market over the last 12 months. 
The exception has been the most recent sale of 
25 Grenfell Street which was bought by Credit 
Suisse (Switzerland).   
State government initiatives fuel 
investment
One  of  the  key  changes  in  the  Adelaide 
market over the last 12 months was the State 

government  announcement  that  Stamp  Duty 
on  commercial  real  property  assets  will  be 
abolished  by  2018.  There  are three  stages to 
this,  with the  first  cut to the  stamp  duty  rate 
effective in December 2015. The second cut is 
due  July  1st  2017  which  will  reduce the  rate 
by  a  further  third  with  the  full  abolishment 
due  in  2018.  This  will  make  Adelaide  one  of 
the  most  competitive  places  to  do  business 
nationally and it is expected that sales volumes 
will increase on the back of fewer transaction 
barriers. 
Increased transaction activity  
in 2017 
New  commercial  supply  is  limited  over  the 
next two to three years, which combined with 
improvements  in  white  collar  employment, 
is  likely  to  tighten  vacancy  from  2017.  The 
improvement  in  the  market  is  likely  to  offer 
some scope for an element of yield compression 
in  2017.  There  are  also  several  assets  being 
marketed which are likely to transact early next 
year, implying sales volumes in the first half of 
2017 will remain strong.

PERTH

Chinese Investors eye Perth
Asian  capital  continues  to  see  value  in 
Perth’s property market, with the major 
transactions  for  2016  dominated  by 
Asian buyers. 

Since  the  beginning  of  2016,  Westralia  Place 
at 167 St Georges Terrace, The Forrest Centre 
at 221 St Georges Terrace and 81 St Georges 
Terrace sold to investors originating from China 
& Singapore. These three assets transacted for 
a combined $360.35 million. This was 57.8 per 
cent  higher  than  the  previous  year’s  total  of 
$228.4 million from the sale of four assets.

Colliers International also understands that 141 
St Georges Terrace, part of ICWA’s divestment 
of three CBD assets, brought to market in 2015, 
is  also  currently  in the  crosshairs  of  Chinese 
interests. This is further affirmation that Perth 
is  well  and  truly  on  the  radar  of  Chinese 
investors who are on a global hunt for assets to 
diversify their portfolios and/or hedge against 
Chinese domestic issues.

Perth’s shared time zone and proximity to Asian 
commercial  hubs,  along  with  its  long-term 
growth  prospects,  have  acted  as  a  drawcard 
for  ‘patient  capital’  from  Asia.  This  has  also 
been  evident  in  acquisitions  of  major  CBD 
development  sites  by  foreign  Asian  interests 
over the past year.
Prime assets with strong lease 
profiles drive demand
The CBD office vacancy rate remains elevated 
and  rents  have  fallen  significantly  from  the 
peak. Despite this there have been no signs of 
Prime  CBD  assets  in  distress,  since the  start 
of the current down-cycle some three and half 
years ago. 

To date, Prime assets with strong lease profiles 
are keenly sought which has resulted in further 
yield compression over the past year, as deep-
pocket private and foreign institutions compete 
with  local  institutions  and  major  syndicates 
for secure assets to park capital and generate 
positive inflation adjusted cash flow.

Perth CBD Prime Office Yields
9.0%

This  scenario  is  likely to  persist  in  2017.  
However, the recent elections result in the 
US and its impact on the inflation outlook, 
future interest rates and bond rates could 
change yield expectations. 

In a first for Perth, 
two of the major 
asset sales this year 
were to mainland 
Chinese investors.
This signals a new 
source of Asian 
capital to add to the 
Singaporean and 
Malaysian investor 
pool.

CASE STUDY NSW

The  building’s  prime  location  and  Sydney’s 
surging  B  grade  occupier  market  created  an 
unmatched  level  of  interest  from  local  and 
offshore  funds,  developers  and  syndicators. 
Ultimately,  the  campaign  yielded  over  75 
inspections and almost 30 EOI’s, with the sale 
reflecting  a  rate  per  m²  of  $14,896/m²  and  a 
reversionary cap rate of 4.80 per cent. 

The strength of Sydney’s leasing market played 
a material role in the sale, providing buyers with 
comfort around purchasing a near-vacant asset. 
Marketed by Colliers International, the sale was 
a great demonstration of the enormous depth 
of capital for core Sydney assets, with over $2.1 
billion in unsatisfied capital.

Capital Markets – Australian Office  |  2016 2017 INVESTMENT 
OUTLOOK

Potential for more yield compression
Throughout  much  of  2016,  the  commercial 
property  asset  class,  both  direct  and  listed, 
benefitted from tailwinds of increasing investor 
uncertainty,  a  flight  to  defensive  asset  classes 
and declining bond market yields. 

Recent  political  events  have  disrupted  these 
tailwinds  to  an  extent,  with  the  most  obvious 
example  being  the  spike  in  global  bond  yields. 
However  even  after  taking  these  factors  into 
consideration,  scope  remains  for  further  yield 
compression  within  the  commercial  property 
sector.  For  example  in  the  September  2016 

quarter,  prime  assets  within  Sydney  and 
Melbourne were yielding 5.76 per cent and 5.5 
per cent respectively, achieving spreads of 3.75 
per cent and 3.49 per cent over the risk free 
rate at that time. This is almost double the long 
term historical spread for both markets. Even 
after taking into account the recent increase in 
bond  yields,  these  spreads  remain  healthy  at 
3.06 per cent and 3.63 per cent for Sydney and 
Melbourne respectively. So while spreads have 
without  doubt  narrowed  over  the  last  month, 
they  still  remain  above  long  term  averages 
implying favourable returns for new investors.

More stock coming to market
2016  has  been  characterised  by 
lower 
transaction  volumes  as 
investors  became 
increasingly  comfortable  with  holding  core 
positions at record levels of pricing. This has 
created  an  element  of  frustration  amongst 
new investors as the weight of capital chasing 
deployment was met with a shortage of stock. 
Looking forward, we expect that 2017 will see 
an increase in transaction volumes, as offshore 
investors  with  core  strategies  capitalise  on 
the  strong  market  conditions  and  rotate  out 
of current positions. We anticipate that future 
yield compression will be facilitated by this core 
stock becoming available to investors, allowing 
an element of repricing to occur.

5% cap rate breach in sight

Increased transaction volumes

It's not all about Sydney and 
Melbourne

%

Whilst  yields  continue  to  compress,  2016  did 
not witness the offering of the quality of stock 
to  warrant  a  sub-5  per  cent  cap  rate.  It  is 
anticipated sales reflecting the cycle's first sub-
5 per cent cap rate may occur in 2017.

large-scale 

2017  is  expected  to  witness  higher  volumes 
of 
transactions,  with  owners 
of  existing  assets  expected  to  capitalise  on 
favourable  conditions  and  developers  selling 
down new product.

A  combination  of  leasing  forecasts  and  the 
hunt for return and WALE has increased buyer 
demand for Brisbane, Perth and Canberra.
