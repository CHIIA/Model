2159 GMT - Credit Suisse is baffled by Chinese private equity firmHony Capital 's US$750 million sale
of its 11.7% stake in Australian oil and gas producer Santos (STO.AU) to ENN Ecological Holdings
(600803.SH), a unit of Chinese gas distributor ENN. Hony bought the stake in Santos as part of the
Australian company's review in November 2015, and was billed as a long-term strategic investor.
Clearly that's not how it panned out in this case. Credit Suisse says Hony bought shares at an average
price of A$4.90 each. "With the move in the Australian dollar, it has possibly actually not lost money on
the deal," Credit Suisse says. "That said, it doesn't seem to have locked in a huge profit." It keeps an
outperform call on Santos and a A$4.10/share price target. STO last traded at A$4.03.
