SYDNEY, March 14 (Reuters) - China's state-owned utility State Power Investment Corp, fresh from a $2.5
billion acquisition of Australian renewable companyPacific Hydro Pty Ltd, has signed an agreement with
Banco Santander to acquire its Australian Taralga Wind Farm Pty Ltd for an enterprise value of about
A$300m (US$227m), sources said.
SPIC is acquiring the wind farm with the existing debt, but is likely to refinance the facility at a later stage, the
sources said. The acquisition will close in around six to eight weeks.
Located in New South Wales state, the 106.8MW Taralga Wind Farm project, which comes with a 10-year
power purchase agreement with Energy Australia, was built at a cost of A$280m. ANZ, the Federal
government's renewable investment fund Clean Energy Finance Corp (CEFC) and Danish export credit
agency EK provided the debt, which comprised 65 percent of the cost, according to CEFC's website.
The SILC Group, a Melbourne-based boutique firm, was the financial adviser to SPIC, while King & Wood
Mallesons was the legal adviser. ANZ was financial adviser to Santander, while Freehills was the legal
adviser.

SPIC closed a $2.5bn-equivalent 12-month bridge loan at the end of January for the Pacific
Hydroacquisition from IFM Investors Ltd. China Construction Bank took half of the loan, with Banco
Santander, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, DBS Bank and
Societe Generale also participating.
That acquisition was entirely debt funded and the lenders relied on a parent guarantee from SPIC, according
to other sources familiar with the deal. Pacific Hydro's portfolio comprised 19 wind and hydro electricity
projects in Australia, Chile and Brazil totalling 900MW, with another 1.8GW of projects in development.
