LP  BACKLASH from Tasmanian farmers is expected to occur if the sale of processing company Van Diemen's Land

Company is approved by the foreign investment review boards.

The organisation announced on Friday that it had rejected a $250 million offer from Tasmanian owned
consortium TasFoods, opting instead to take a higher bid from an unnamed international company.

TD  The successful bidder for the 190-year-old VDL, based at Tasmania's Woolnorth property, could include - but is

not limited to - Chinese or Thai consortiums, understood to have shown an interest in the deal.

TasFoods chairman Rob Woolley told The Australian that they had not only organised a clean contract with the
company, but were also offering the price asked of them.

Mr Woolley said he believed the New Zealand organisation was using delays caused by TasFoods seeking
shareholder approval to renege on the deal.

"They've managed to use a technicality to essentially get around, and negotiate outside of, our arrangements
without telling us," he said.

"There's going to be a lot of disappointed [sic] in Tasmania about this, particularly within the farming
communities, that we can be gazumped like this."

The company operates 25 dairy farms in the far North-West, including 13 at Woolnorth, and 12 near Circular
Head.

VLD announced a $52 million sales revenue and record production of 7.66 million kilograms of milk solids in its
2015 annual results - an increase of 14 per cent on 2014.
