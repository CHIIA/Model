LP  A  CHINESE  investor has snapped up the Civic Square Shopping Centre for $30.51 million after the  sale  of two

other major shopping centres in Croydon in just six months.

The 6371sq m centre has been owned by the same Melbourne family since being built in 1986 and includes a
Woolworths supermarket and 18 shops.

TD  Commercial  real  estate  agent Mark Wizel said there were 14 offers on the  site , with it being acquired on a

strong passing yield of 6.17 per cent.

It was bought by a  Chinese  investor. But Mr Wizel did not comment specifically on who’d bought the  site  or if
there were plans for redevelopment.

It comes after the recent  sale  of Croydon Central, Kent Ave, Croydon, for $41 million, and Maroondah Village
Shopping Centre, corner of Maroondah Highway and Exeter Rd, Croydon North, for $13 million.

Mr Wizel said the high number of shopping centre sales showed buyers had an ongoing interest in the sub-$50
million Victorian retail investment market.

“It has been a very eye-opening three weeks for our team,” he said. “We saw serious activity during the strong
2007 market but what we have witnessed and continue to witness in 2015 has taken activity to a whole new
level.” He said vendors were also gaining confidence to offer Victorian retail  assets  for  sale .

It leaves the future of many local shopping centres up in the air, including Croydon Central.

The centre was  sold  to Haben  Property  Fund in July this year. Former owner PCL Prattcorp said in June that
Haben had plans to transform it into one of the region’s best convenience-based shopping centre destinations.

Works were expected to start in late 2015. However, there is no planning permit before Maroondah Council.

Haben  Property  has been contacted for comment.Maroondah Village was  sold  on April 16 this year to an
undisclosed buyer.
