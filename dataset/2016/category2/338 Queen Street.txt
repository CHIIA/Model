COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ■ AMP Capital has struck a deal to buy the Stud Park Shopping Centre
in Rowville for $154 million.

Investors in AMP’s Wholesale Australian Property Fund will own the subregional centre, 30km east
of the CBD, which also houses a council library.

Fund manager Chris Davitt said the centre’s solid performance was expected to continue given the
area’s households boasted incomes that were 12 per cent above the Melbourne average.

The 26,000sq m centre’s anchor tenants include Woolworths, Coles and Kmart and it also houses
58 specialty tenants and has 1500 car spaces with room to grow on an 11 hectare site.

The fund has 13 properties worth about $700 million and aims to provide stable returns, made up
primarily of income with some long-term capital growth, Mr Davitt said.

It targets assets which have high occupancy rates and stable income streams underpinned by
leases to long-term, secure commercial tenants.

Location, location ■ A “DEEP pool of buyers” took an interest in a well located Malvern East office
investment with the successful bidder paying $9.85 million, shortly after the auction.

Private investor Garry Dumbrell, who bought the property, said strong sale of 1911 Malvern Rd was
reflective of the lack of supply of quality suburban commercial office investments Mr Dumbrell also
acquired another office complex, 17-27 Cotham Road, Kew, for $10.3 million in 2013.

Colliers International and GormanKelly marketed the 2315sq m, three-level Malvern East property,
which has 87 on-site car parking spaces and sits on a 1604sq m site.

It is fully leased and returns about $717,091 a year.

A number of developers were keen on the site because of its potential for a future residential
development.

But Mr Dumbrell said he would carry out some capital works to the building in a bid to attract new
tenants in the future.

$12m for city site ■A CHINESE investor has bought into the CBD with $12 million for 338 Queen
Street, in an off-market deal brokered by Savills.

vacant possession on a land rate of $41,379 per square metre.

The purchaser has the option of redeveloping the site or occupying it. Savills’ Clinton Baxter said the
purchaser had flown into Melbourne for one day to view the property, “demonstrating the intense
demand for prime CBD properties with significant potential to add value”.

Cafe changes ■ THE freehold of the popular Pipe Road Cafe in Laverton North has been sold by
agents Gray Johnson to a private investor for $564,000.

Located at 23 Pipe Rd, the outer west property is on 1011sq m of land, with a 268sq m building in
an industrial complex in the vibrant logistics centre of Laverton.

It is leased for two years plus a further three-year renewal and returns $29,808 a year.

Room to move ■ ELITE Surface Technologies has leased a new office and warehouse at
Dandenong South in the southeast.

The 305 Frankston-Dandenong Rd property comprises a 3327sq m office and warehouse on a
8445sq m site.

Agents Savills Australia said the property was let for four years at $250,000 a year to the growing
business which required a new fitout for its laboratory department.SEE MORE AT
