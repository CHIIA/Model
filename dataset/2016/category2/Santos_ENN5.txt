0333 GMT [Dow Jones ] Plans by a unit of Chinese gas distributor ENN to acquire an 11.7% stake in
Australia's Santos (STO.AU) may be a prelude to a full-blown takeover, says Bernstein analyst Neil
Beveridge. Under the deal, ENN Ecological Holdings (600803.SH) will buy Hony Capital 's stake in
Santos for $750 million. Hony will then take a stake in ENN Ecological Holdings via a private
placement. "We believe ENN are dipping their toe in the water and could well come back for a full-blow
takeover of Santos," Beveridge says in a note. He says a takeover by Hong Kong-listed ENN would be
less politically sensitive than if it were by a state-owned Chinese oil giant, and would help the Chinese
company grow to span the entire natural gas value chain from production to final distribution.
