Chinese group Union Agriculture has snapped up Kyabra Station, a 5259-hectare prime sheep and
cattle-breeding property north of Tamworth, for $11 million, taking its agricultural holdings in rural NSW to
more than 12,000 hectares.

Union Agriculture is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hebei-based Jiahe Brewery which, according to its website,
supplies customers in China with "high-quality beef and sheep meat" as well as producing 400,000 kilolitres
of beer every year in Hebei province and Beijing.
In 2011, Union Agriculture paid $13.8 million for more than 4500 hectares of farmland at Galong and
Binalong in southern NSW and $7 million for 2840 hectares in Greg Greg, east of Wodonga. The company,
which has two Beijing-based directors and two based in Sydney and Launceston, also made an unsuccessful
bid in 2014 for the 12,000-hectare south-west Queensland cropping property Undabri, sold by receivers to
another Chinese buyer, Orient Agriculture for $30 million.
Another Chinese group, Shanghai Pengxin, controlled by China-based Hunan Dakang Pasture Farming, is
expected to be the preferred bidder for the vast S.Kidman & Co portfolio, excluding Anna Creek.

All these transactions are part of a huge wave of Asian investment into prime Australian farmland.
Large-scale beef, lamb and dairy-producing properties are the most sought-after properties, driven by the
massive demand among the Chinese middle-classes for these foods.

...

In the past two years the property ran more than 1000 agisted cattle and has previously carried 3000
cross-bred ewes producing prime lambs. The sale included a five-bedroom homestead, four other homes, a
woolshed, cattle yards, an artificial insemination centre, stables, hay and machinery sheds.
