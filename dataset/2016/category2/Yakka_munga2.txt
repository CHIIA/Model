A Chinese company which was part of the blocked bid for the Kidman cattle empire has finalised the
purchase of a station near Broome despite attempts by One Nation senator-elect Rod Culleton to
stop the deal.

The Australian arm of Shanghai CRED paid Buru Energy close to $10 million for Yakka Munga
station and cattle in a deal that settled last week.

Yakka Munga was formerly owned by Pastoralists and Graziers Association stalwart Ruth
Webb-Smith and her son Nathan, who maintain they should not have been kicked off the 189,000ha
pastoral lease.

The deal with Buru comes a month after Shanghai CRED, operating in Australia as Shanghai Zenith,
purchased Mt Elizabeth Station in the Kimberley.

The company is also close to acquiring a string of stations in the Goldfields.

Mr Culleton has been helping the Webb-Smith family in attempts to reclaim the station they lost
when the ANZ Bank moved to recover multimillion-dollar debts.

Buru trumped five other bidders, including Gina Rinehart, when Yakka Munga was put up for sale
through receivers in 2014.

Nathan Webb-Smith, who until recently was contract mustering in the Kimberley, said last week his
family was grateful for the work Mr Culleton had done to try to save their station.

“Admittedly, his approach is a bit unorthodox but the orthodox approach wasn’t working,” Mr
Webb-Smith said.

“It was never going to work and would have cost us millions in legal fees. He has kept a lot of
farmers on their feet through his unorthodox approach.”

Mr Culleton said WA Lands Minister Terry Redman had ignored his requests not to approve the sale
of Yakka Munga.
