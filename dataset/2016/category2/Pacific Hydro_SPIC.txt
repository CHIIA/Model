THE company that owns the Codrington and Cape Bridgewater wind farms has been sold for over $3 billion.
China's state-owned firmState Power Investment Corporation has bought Pacific Hydro from fund manager
IFM Investors, which had owned the business since trumping Spain's Acciona in a $725 million takeover
deal in 2005.
Pacific Hydro owns 900 megawatts of generation capacity across 19 hydropower dams and wind farms in
Australia, Chile and Brazil, including wind farms at Yambuk, Codrington, Cape Nelson, and Cape
Bridgewater. It also has a significant pipeline of wind projects and potential wind sites in Australia.
The transaction counts among the largest acquisitions in Australia's energy sector by a Chinese government
entity.
This sale has already been approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board, according to sources.
The deal comes amid heightened sensitivity about Chinese acquisitions of Australian infrastructure.
