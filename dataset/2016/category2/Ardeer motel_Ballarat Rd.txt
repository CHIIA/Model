■ FATHER-and-son partnership John and David Swain have sold a 44-room Ardeer motel to a Chinese
investor for an estimated $5.5 million.

The western suburbs Sunshine Motor Inn achieved a 3.5-star rating after a refurbishment three years ago,
which led to year-on-year revenue growth, said selling agents CBRE.
The Swains had operated the 608 Ballarat Rd motel for two decades. CBRE’s Scott Callow said six firm

seeking accommodation assets at both ends of the market,” Mr Callow said.
The property also has a two-bedroom manager’s residence, swimming pool, public bar and a restaurant.
