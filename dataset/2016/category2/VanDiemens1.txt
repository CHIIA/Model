LP  Australia’s largest and oldest  dairy  farm has been effectively  sold  for $220  million  to  Chinese  owners.

Herman Shao-ming Hu and Kenny Zhang are finalising the  purchase  of a majority interest in the 190-year-old
Van  Diemen’s Land  Company  (VDL) in Tasmania.

Chinese buy  nation’s largest  dairy

TD  The near-completed deal comes in the same week as federal parliament prepares to  debate the  Chinese -

Australia free-trade agreement, and will be a test of Treasurer Scott Morrison’s attitude to foreign investment.

Mr Hu and Mr Zhang through their respective companies,  Ryoden Development and the Australia-registered
Waratah Corporation, will each  buy  about 35 per cent of VDL from current owner New Zealand’s New Plymouth
Council.

The other third of Australia’s biggest single  milk  producer is set to be bought by the Lempriere Capital  equity
managers, linked to the Melbourne-based Lemp riere family, noted wool traders.

The deal is one of Australia’s biggest agricultural sales to  foreign investors and will require  approval by the
Foreign Investment Review  Board  as it is significantly larger than the new $15m approval threshold set earlier
this year.

In 2012, the Lempriere  group  also organised the  sale  of Australia’s largest cotton farm and irrigation water
holder, Cubbie Station, to another  Chinese company , Shandong Ruyi, for $240m, retaining a 20 per cent
stake  for itself.

Hong Kong -based Mr Hu and former Howard government communications minister Richard Alston, chairman
of Waratah Corporation, visited Tasmania last week to inspect the 25  dairy  farms owned by VDL.

They met Premier Will Hodgman and State Growth and  Energy  Minister Matthew Groom.

Neither Mr Hu, who is a deputy of  China ’s National  People’s Congress and chairman of  Hong Kong ’s City
University, or Australian-educated mainland  Chinese  property developer and  coal billionaire  Kenny Zhang,
have any previous agricultural interests.

But both  Chinese  companies have access to distribution and marketing channels in  China  and  Hong Kong ,
where any food and farm products they produce in Australia can be  sold  directly.

VDL’s new  Chinese  owners plan to further expand and  develop its farms and associated infrastructure to focus
on  China ’s growing demand for infant baby formula and  milk -based health drinks for its ageing population.

There are also suggestions the  company  may build its own  milk  powder plant to enable all its  milk
production, processing and distribution systems to remain within its own networks.

One of the key reasons for Mr Hu and Mr Zhang’s interest in VDL is understood to be the  location of its  dairy
farms and the 19,000ha of land it owns in remote Tasmania.

They believe foods grown and produced from Tasmania, and  potentially marketed under a  special new  brand
highlighting VDL’s centrepiece station Woolnorth as the location of the world’s cleanest air and water at Cape
Grim, will sell particularly well in  China .

VDL runs a massive herd of 29,000  dairy  cattle on a combined 19,000ha of fertile farmland in northern
Tasmanian.

Its 18,000 milking cows, most located on Woolnorth station on the state’s isolated northwest tip, as well as 12
other farms, produce more than 100  million  litres of  milk  a year, making the VDL  company  Australia’s largest
single  milk  supplier.

The Bureau of Meteorology also has an air-testing station at Cape Grim, while VDL’s Woolnorth farm is already
home to 62  wind  turbines, majority-owned by  another  Chinese company , the Shenhua  Energy Group

Mr Zheng, managing director of Waratah Corporation which started life as his first  business  Waratah Paint,
earlier this year flagged his move out of investment in the slowing  mining  and resources sector into
agribusiness in Australia and New Zealand.

“With the domestic food safety problem becoming more and more serious, most  Chinese  are paying more
attention to safety and healthy food,” Mr Zheng wrote in a recent message on his  company  website.

The Tasmanian government, which did not respond to requests for comment yesterday, is understood to be
thrilled by the  Chinese  interest — and much-needed  foreign capital — into Australia’s smallest and poorest
state and its booming  dairy  industry.

There are also hopes other  Chinese  investors may now invest in Tasmania’s ageing container port at
Launceston or at Burnie — as well as in direct shipping services between Tasmania and  China .

None of the companies  involved in the  sale  would comment yesterday.

The  company  has been informally on the market for the past three years, with potential  Chinese  investors
always prominent in talks.

Sources told The Australian that, while formal  purchase   papers had not been signed, contracts were well
advanced and would proceed to signing ahead of FIRB approval within days.

Lempriere Capital’s  purchase  of one-third of Tasmania’s biggest  dairy  operation marks a nostalgic return to its
roots.

Its heritage goes back to 1823, when Tasmanian woolgrower and trader Thomas Lempriere founded the Bank of
Van Diemen’s Land, Australia’s second bank.
