Chinese gas distributor ENN Group is set to become the largest shareholder in Santos after agreeing to
buy an 11.7% stake in the Australian company for US$750 million. The move is testament to the
growing ambitions of China's private energy firms on the M&A market as its national oil companies
(NOCs) remain largely out of the game.  
ENN Ecological Holdings , a subsidiary of ENN Group, said Thursday it was acquiring the entire stake in
Santos that is currently held by Chinese private equity firmHony Capital , as part of its strategy to
develop into a vertically integrated international gas company. 

Emboldened by pro-competition reforms in China, ENN is building its own LNG receiving terminal in
Zhoushan, in the eastern Zhejiang province and has in recent months signed agreements with several
big-name suppliers (LNGI Mar.2'16).

"This introduction to the upstream sector takes us a step forward in our aim to generate value across the
entire natural gas value chain, and allows us to learn and build experience," said Wang Yusuo , chairman
of ENN Group. 

Santos said it welcomed ENN onto its shareholder register given its knowledge of the gas business across
the region.
ENN will pay the $750 million part cash, part equity. The deal's price tag works out at A$4.82 (US$3.62)
per share, which is roughly a 23% premium to Santos' closing price in Sydney on Wednesday. At the
same time, Hony Capital will become a strategic investor in ENN Ecological Holdings via a private
placement of US$380 million.
Hony Capital only recently acquired most of its shares in Santos through the company's A$2.5 billion
($1.76 billion) equity raise, in a move designed to reduce its debt after a strategic review failed to offload
any assets (LNGI Nov.10'15).

"We chose to invest in Santos because of its strategic position in Australia and synergies with the rapidly
growing China energy market," said John Zhao, chairman of Hony Capital. "Bringing in ENN as a
strategic investor will help Santos connect to that opportunity in China, and at the same time we are
helping a Chinese company expand internationally."
Santos' main assets are a 13.5% stake in Papua New Guinea's 6.9 million ton/year PNG LNG project
and its 30% stake in the $18.5 billion Gladstone LNG project in the Australian state of Queensland,
where production started last year.

But Citi analyst Dale Koenders said in a note it is hard for to see synergies from the deal for ENN given
the LNG offtake from Santos' projects is largely already contracted. "Therefore, we see this investment as
based on value, with expectations of growing gas demand in China longer term, LNG markets moving
back to balance after 2020, and a view of recovery in oil prices in the medium term."
ENN last year sold 11.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas in China, where demand growth has slowed
sharply over the past two years. The company supplies gas to more than 12 million households in 152

tons of LNG annually, accounting for about 20% of the LNG trade volume in China.

Meanwhile, analysts at Bernstein said they believe ENN is dipping its toe in the water and could well come
back for a full-blown takeover of Santos. "Given that ENN is not an NOC, such a move would be less
politically sensitive than if the acquisition was made by a Chinese oil major," they wrote in a note. Any
major overseas transactions by China's NOCs would also come under close scrutiny in China itself in the
wake of a sweeping corruption probe that has examined previous big-money acquisitions. 
The deal remains subject to ENN shareholder approval and customary regulatory filings in China.
