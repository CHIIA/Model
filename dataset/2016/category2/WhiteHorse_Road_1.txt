A boutique 1870s building with six apartments in a coveted "Poet's Corner" location at 2 Mozart Street
was snapped up at auction for $4,755,000. CBRE's Julian White, who negotiated the deal with Josh
Rutman and Chao Zhang, said the result was evidence of interest in Melbourne's luxury apartment
market.

Hawthorn

Three strata shops at 769 Glenferrie Road have sold on an average yield of 4.25 per cent with a
combined value of $4.11 million, Gorman Commercial's Stephen Gorman and Stephen Speck said. "In
a time when we are seeing stand-alone retail in the same strip sell on yields less than 3 per cent,
smarter buyers are acknowledging retail tenants no longer have a use for first-floor dwellings and
offices," Mr Gorman said.

Balwyn

A Chinese family has snapped up a Balwyn shop for $6.18 million. The 701 sq m property at 313-315
Whitehorse Road sold with existing leases to established bedding retailer Back to Sleep and creative
agency Web Silk on a weighted average lease expiry of four years, returning combined annual income
of $376,000 net. CBRE's Josh Rutman, Rorey James, Mark Wizel and Benson Zhou negotiated the
sale.

A 1303 sq m office warehouse at 5/35 Taunton Drive was auctioned for $2 million, $450,000 over
reserve. Steven Salopek from Crabtrees Real Estate said the price reflected a "shortage of stock within
the suburban south-eastern industrial market". In another deal, four factories making up 69 Renver
Road in Clayton sold for $925,000 with current passing net rent of $53,910 plus GST, he said.

Prahran

An ordinary looking brick building sold for what may be the lowest yield for an inner suburban industrial
property this year - 1.6 per cent. The 11-13 Regent Street factory was nabbed by a developer at a
heated auction for $2 million, about $550,000 above reserve at a land rate of $9000 a sq m, said Teska
Carson's George Takis and Barry Novy.

Developers looking at building small office warehouses were interested in 8-10 Monomeeth Drive which
sold for $2,821,289. Gorman Commercial's Stephen Gorman said industrial sites, like the 5281 sq m
block that sold, have "brought out seasoned eastern suburban developers who on many cases haven't
been in the market for nearly 10 years".

Glen Waverley

A commercial in-fill site with redevelopment potential has sold for $6.25 million. The 810 sq m site at 50
Montclair Avenue sold before auction to a local developer, Ray White Commercial Glen Waverley's
