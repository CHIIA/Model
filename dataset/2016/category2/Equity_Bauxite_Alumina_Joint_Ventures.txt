EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN UNDER THE JOINT VENTURE WITH HD MINING

Background

In 2010 the Company entered into a JV with HD Mining & Investment Pty Ltd (HD Mining) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Shandong Bureau No1 Institute for
Prospecting of Geology & Minerals (Shandong) to explore for bauxite. The JV provides for HD Mining to fund 100% of exploration and feasibility costs for HD
Mining to earn:

(a) a 40% interest in any defined area of exploration on the making a binding commitment by HD Mining to undertake a detailed feasibility study for the
commercial mining of the defined area; and

(b) a further 20% interest in a defined area upon completion of the feasibility study and the making by the JV committee of a decision to commence mining.

Current Activities

Current fiscal restraints advised in the last quarter have led to HD Mining deferring a decision to commence a feasibility study, and a reduction of exploration to
minimal levels.

Negotiations are being undertaken to determine the way forward for the HDJV following continued delays from HD Mining in meeting its JV contribution
commitments over the last two quarters.

CORPORATE

Completion of Sale of Yankuang Joint Venture Interest and Buy-Back of Shares

As announced on 21 January 2016, following shareholder approval on 18th January 2016, completion occurred on the sale of BRL's interest in the joint
ventures with its Chinese partner Yankuang Resources for $7.15m and the buy-back of Yankuang's 19,700,000 shares for $1.15m.

As a consequence of the transaction the following changes have occurred:

o BRL's net cash funds increased by $6m, being the difference between the sale price of $7.15m received for its interest in the BAJV and the buy-back sum of
$1.15m paid by BRL for Yankuang's shares in BRL;

o BRL has a royalty right of 0.9% of the FOB price (presently estimated to be worth approx. 50 cents per tonne) from the sale of the first 100 million tonnes of
bauxite mined from the Felicitas and Fortuna tenements. Mercator Metals Pty Ltd executed the Deed of Variation & Assumption on the Fortuna tenement
required under the Yankuang Sale Agreement to approve the assignment of the Fortuna bauxite rights on 20 April 2016, which will now be included in the
royalty;

o Following the cancellation of the 19,700,000 shares the subject of the buy-back, the total shares on issue have been reduced to 214,302,336 shares;

o Yankuang's representative Mr Cunliang Lai has resigned from the BRL Board; and

o BRL has no further obligations under the BAJV to continue to fund the joint ventures, which has substantially reduced BRL's ongoing costs of operation.
