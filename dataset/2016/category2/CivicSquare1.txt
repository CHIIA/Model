LP  Investors' appetite for well-leased shopping centres continues as the Civic Square Shopping Centre in Croydon

is  sold  for $30.51 million to a mainland  Chinese  buyer.

The centre, which is anchored by a Woolworths supermarket and includes 18 specialty retailers, was owned by
the same Melbourne family since it was built in 1986.

TD  CBRE's Mark Wizel, who negotiated the  sale  with colleague Justin Dowers, said offshore investors were

moving up the food chain to focus on sub-$50 million income-producing  assets .

"We saw serious activity during the strong 2007 market but what we have witnessed and continue to witness in
this space in 2015 has taken activity to a whole new level," Mr Wizel said.

Civic Square  sold  on a sharp passing yield of 6.17 per cent.

Other recent outer eastern suburbs sales include the Mountain High Shopping Centre ($22.5 million), Croydon
Central ($41 million) and the Maroondah Village Shopping Centre ($13.3 million).

One beneficiary of the favourable conditions has been Michael Lasky's retail development arm, Lascorp.

"We have  sold  several properties for Lascorp this year," Mr Wizel said.
