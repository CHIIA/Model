LP  OXFORD CENTRAL EPPING HAS BEEN BLESSED BY A MASTER OF THE ANCIENT ART WHO HELPED IN THE DESIGN TO FOSTER PROSPERITY

FOR BUYERS, WRITES SHAYNE COLLIER

On the advice of a feng shui master, a water feature strategically located to encourage wealth and prosperity has been incorporated into the landscape design
for Oxford Central Epping.

TD  Chinese-backed developer Greaton (formerly Zhentang Group) procured the expert’s services for guidance on the ancient art to the architects and landscape

designers working on the $260 million project.

When completed in 2018, Oxford Central will be comprised of 252 apartments across two 17-storey towers on a 5170sq m site 150m from Epping station.

More than 75 per cent of the apartments will be two and three bedroom, and some of these will have views of the city skyline and Epping.

The pet-friendly development will have a 250m green space to include a walking and meditation path, barbecue area and dog park.

A two-storey heritage building on the site that used to be a bakery will be transformed into a cafe dining area to form part of 625sq m ground-level retail.

There will be 292 car parking spaces although some of the one-bedroom apartments have no on-site parking.

Greaton managing director Nicho Teng said the feng shui component of the project was just one positive aspect of a “quality product” on a premium site on one
of the highest physical points of the suburb.

He was confident of an enthusiastic response to the official launch on October 22.

“The demand is still strong for apartment living in this precinct,” Mr Teng said. “Buyers will be convinced by the location and the product itself, which is
superior.” Although no contracts have officially changed hands, Mr Teng said he expected buyers to fall broadly into two categories.

“We are expecting young families, growing families, to buy here because of the central location and the great schools in the area,” Mr Teng said.

Investors are also prominent.

“The investors will buy for the future and a strong rental market,” he said. Mr Teng said he believed the quality of the project would win buyer confidence. “This
is a quality product from the architects through to the fittings and finishes,” he said.

All apartments will feature timber floors, Caesarstone benchtops, timber accents on the kitchen cupboards, Miele appliances and Parisi tapware.

Imported tiles will be used in the bathrooms, and floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors will open to wide balconies.

Greaton is involved in several other developments nationally, including the West Franklin project in the Adelaide CBD.

It recently bought The Ribbon, a $730 million hotel property to be built at Sydney’s Darling Harbour.

Oxford Central Epping will join a plethora of off-the -plan developments in Epping, propelling the suburb towards a targeted 3670 new apartments that will
accommodate 8000 residents.
