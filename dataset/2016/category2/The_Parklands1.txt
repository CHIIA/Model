SHANGHAI, January 18, SinoCast -- China Overseas Holdings bought a land lot covering 5022 square
meters for home development in the Macquarie Park, northern Sydney, at AUD 80 million.
Macquarie Universitysold the land lot, known as the Parklands. The land lot is at the corner of the Herring
Street and the Epping Street. Four old dorm buildings are there, which are for student accommodation.

The old buildings will be dismantled; 280 apartments would be built there, which will have a total
construction area of 22599 square meters, or ground retailing and commercial apartments would be built
there.
Sydney is the second overseas city the company enters after London. The company spent GBP 200
million buying an office building in London in 2012, and the project has begun bringing in rentals. The
company's overseas businesses merely include two commercial projects in core areas of London.

complex with an investment of AUD 800 million there.
