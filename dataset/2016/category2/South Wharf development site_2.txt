LP  Paul Little has more than tripled his money on a site in Melbourne’s Docklands, selling to a Chinese group.

The former Toll Holdings boss put the South Wharf development site on the market in March, and the site’s permits for two residential towers with 940
apartments saw it draw interest from offshore and locally, with over eight parties bidding.

TD  The sale by Mr Little, who now owns and runs Little Projects, of 89 Lorimer Street, also set a record price for the south Fishermans Bend precinct.

The ex-Essendon Football Club chairman struck the deal on the 8847sq m property through Colliers International after winning ministerial approval to build the
towers.

They will span 49 and 47 levels and have been designed by architects Elenberg Fraser — the firm behind a string of high-rise developments, including
Melbourne’s Swanston Central.

Trent Hobart and Bryson Cameron of Colliers International brokered the deal which could see the Shanghai-based new entrant undertake a project even larger
than Mirvac Group’s at the Yarra’s Edge precinct.

“In the midst of government increases to costs for foreign investment, we have been able to sell the site to a large, private offshore new entrant which shows
international confidence in Melbourne as a long-term investment proposition,” Mr Hobart said.

Mr Little marketed the property as a premium site with a de-risked planning and infra structure framework.
