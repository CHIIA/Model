Residential: Developers across Australia have brushed off warnings about a potential pullback in bank
lending to foreigners and apartment buyers by forging ahead with a series of major site purchases.

Brokerage CLSA on Friday warned of a looming correction due to market oversupply, saying this
could spark higher defaults among unit buyers.

However, developers are showing their confidence by continuing to buy, as some players are using
the recent slowdown to restock while rivals are out of the market.

A domestic developer with an offshore partner has just bought a site in the Sydney suburb of
Campsie from Abacus Property Group for $49.5 million. The site is approved for 353 units. A smaller
site is also being marketed for sale with approval for 86 units.

Abacus is also reaping the benefits of settlements on 138 land lots in the first two stages of a land
subdivision in the Sydney suburb of Werrington.

Foreign developers are also still buying. A Chinese group is understood to be targeting a 134 parcel
in Menangle Park in Sydney’s southwest.In Canberra, the Art Group has swooped on a major growth
project in a $40m deal. Knight Frank’s Nic Purdue, Daniel McGrath and Tim Holtsbaum managed the
sale. The 2.9ha Dickson site is part of the redevelopment of the Northbourne Avenue corridor.
