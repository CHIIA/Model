LP  acquisitions: Five parties remain in the bidding for the NSW government-owned Australian Technology  Park  in

Sydney’s inner-city Eveleigh.

Australian  property  heavyweights Mirvac, Goodman  Group  and Walker Corporation have been invited to
tender for the 14ha  property , which is expected to sell for more than $200  million , alongside private  equity
group  Altis  Property  Partners, which is bidding with First State Super, and the  Chinese -backed Aqualand.

TD  The  sale  of the precinct, a former heavy rail maintenance  site  on Sydney CBD’s southern fringe, was first

flagged in 2013, although the  property  was only put on the market late last year as part of the state
government’s  property  divestment plan. The proceeds from the  sale  are expected to be diverted to fund part
of the construction of the Central-to-Eveleigh urban renewal project, which is being run by UrbanGrowth NSW,
the same body that controls ATP.

Several other groups appeared to miss out in a competitive tender process. It was previously reported a
syndicate including Allen Linz’s Rebel  Property Group , AsheMorgan and Macquarie Bank had eyed ATP, as
well as a joint venture between Fosun and Propertylink. Lend Lease and Abacus  Property Group  have also
been touted as bidders.

The sales process is being handled by Knight Frank’s Richard Horne, James Parry and Neil Brookes.

The successful bidder will be required to protect many of the precinct’s heritage buildings and preserve public
access to the  site , as well as make allowances for future development over the adjacent rail corridor.

But they will also gain access to three development plots that allow  commercial  and mixed-use buildings of up
to 11 storeys in height and a potential gross floor area of 102,450sq  m .Aqualand is a surprise appearance on
the list of remaining parties. The  company , a subsidiary of Shanghai-based development giant Shenglong
Group , has chased development opportunities in Australia: it last week bought three waterfront buildings in
Pyrmont from the Kerry Stokes-controlled Seven  Group  for $180m.
