Van-Diemen's now has 29,000 milch cows and 10,000 small cows, with annual milk output of 100 million
liters, and it is Australia's largest milk supplier.

Sources said a Hong Kong-based company, together with a company registered by a mining tycoon in
mainland China, will spend AUD 220 million buying a 70% stake in Van-Diemen, and the rest 30% stake
will be acquired by a wool company headquartered in Melbourne.
