LP  BEIJING, October 18, SinoCast -- Australia's high-end fresh milk brand VAN was officially launched in China

on October 16.

Its milk source is from Australia Van Diemen's Land (VDL) that was acquired by a Chinese businessman
Ningbo Pioneer New Materials founder Lu Xianfeng and his company Moon Lake at AUD 280 million at the
beginning of this year. After the transaction was approved, VAN fresh milk then enters the Chinese market.

TD  VDL is Australia's largest single milk supplier, producing over 100 million liters of milk per year. VDL operates

over 19,000 hectares of farmland in northern Tasmania, Australia, has 29,000 dairy cows and has a history
of almost 200 years.

Due to not accepting retail sales, VAN fresh milk only accepts customization in its WeChat public number
and Jingdong platform.

VAN fresh milk was only limited to consumers in Beijing at the early stage and will cover Shanghai,
Guangzhou and other first-tier cities gradually.

According to the public price, 600ML and 1L VAN fresh milk is sold at CNY 24,000 and CNY 36,000,
equivalent to a bottle of 1L milk sold at about CNY 100.
