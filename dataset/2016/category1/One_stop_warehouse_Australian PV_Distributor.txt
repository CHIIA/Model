TD  Noting the “huge pressure” felt by many Chinese solar companies from the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy policies in place in the European Union and the US,
GCL System Integration (GCL-SI) bought a 51% stake in privately owned One Stop Warehouse. The purchase price was not disclosed. One Stop Warehouse
owns four PV distribution centres across Australia, selling modules from the likes of Hanwha Q Cells, Canadian Solar and GCL, and inverters from suppliers
including SMA, Enphase and Sungrow.GCL-SI offers EPC and O&M services to clients in the solar business, as well as financing packages. The acquisition of
One Stop Warehouse is a “crucial step” for the company as it looks for growth beyond China, it says.The aim of the acquisition is to allow GCL-SI “to
strategically enter the global market and develop its own product layout and distributed PV integration unit”, the company says. In addition to GCL-SI, parent
GCL owns controlling stakes in a range of solar businesses, including Hong Kong-listed GCL-Poly, the world’s largest supplier of PV wafers. The company is
also a major module manufacturer.One Stop Warehouse reported sales of A$45.1m ($34.8m) and a net profit of A$1.8m during the January to November 2015
period, according to GCL.
