RETAIL: One of the last vestiges of the DFO empire is close to selling, with Brisbane-based
Taiwanese investors, the Wen family of Chin Hong Investments, close to buying the DFO Jindalee in
western Brisbane for nearly $50 million.
The sale comes as Warren Ebert’s Sentinel Property Group edges closer to buying the Cairns DFO
shopping centre for less than $40m.

The sales at healthy prices justify a decision by the developer to hold on for a recovery in retail
property markets while other parts of its DFO business splintered.

In Cairns, Mr Ebert has flagged the deal will probably settle next month after a required $24m in
equity to buy the northern Queensland centre was rapidly raised.

Sentinel is separately increasing its shareholding in the listed Unity Pacific, which it is trying to take
over as a means of listing its $1 billion property funds operation.

The DFO Jindalee was marketed by Peter Tyson and Jonathan Tyson of Savills as a value-add
opportunity via repositioning, expansion or redevelopment but they declined to comment yesterday.

The single-level centre built in 2007 has more than 70 stores with brands such as Nike, Adidas, Puma
and Kathmandu. It generates a fully leased net income of $3.81m.

DFO Jindalee sits on the Centenary Motorway in the affluent western corridor to Brisbane’s
southwest. It has a trade area of about 488,000 people forecast to grow to 721,000 by 2026. There is
also a strong surrounding retail precinct of over 40,000sq m including Coles, Freedom, Snooze and
First Choice Liquor.

The building spans a gross lettable area of 16,485sq m with more than 900 car parks, and the
39,270sq m site has a range of development options.The Wen family bought the Centro Springwood
centre in 2014 for $53m in what was their sixth shopping centre acquisition in southeast Queensland.
Other centres in the $200m empire are in Burpengary, Morningside, Murrumba Downs, Arundel and
Sunnybank Hills.
