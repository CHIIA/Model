LP  Sydney - Wednesday - November 16: (RWE) - Lundin Mining Corporation [TSX:LUN] announces that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its

indirect interest in TF Holdings Limited to an affiliate of BHR Partners, a Chinese private equity firm, for $1.136 billion in cash and contingent consideration of
up to $51.4 million, consisting of $25.7 million if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $25.7 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20
per pound, both during a 24-month period beginning on January 1, 2018.

The consideration to be received by Lundin Mining is equal to the implied value of the company's stake in TF Holdings based on the transaction between
Freeport-McMoRan Inc and China Molybdenum Co, Ltd announced on May 9, 2016.

TD  TF Holdings is a Bermuda holding company that owns an 80 per cent interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining SA.

Lundin Mining has an indirect 30 per cent interest in TF Holdings and therefore, an effective 24 per cent interest in Tenke.

In connection with the Transaction, Lundin Mining has waived its right of first offer to acquire Freeport's indirect interest in TF Holdings.

The Transaction is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the completion of Freeport's sale of its interest in TF Holdings to CMOC and other
customary closing conditions.

A termination fee of $100 million, which has been secured by a letter of credit that has been received by the company, is payable to Lundin Mining in certain
circumstances, including upon termination of the Transaction due to the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.

Mr Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented: "The decision to sell our minority interest in Tenke has been arrived at following a careful and lengthy
consideration of all options open to us.

It was a difficult decision, respecting the 20 years of Lundin involvement in Tenke, and the special nature of this world class asset.

The sale will enable Lundin Mining to advance its strategy to incrementally grow the company with projects and operations we control, while maintaining a
strong balance sheet.
