LP  Australia’s initial public offers over the past year have easily exceeded the broader market, despite disappointing high-profile misses such as realtor McGrath

and WA’s Wellard.

While the S&P-ASX 200 has lost nearly 12 per cent over the past 12 months, the 81 floats in the same period are trading at a weighted average premium of
11.4 per cent to their issue price, according to Bloomberg data.

TD  The biggest raisers are among the best performers.

Share registry group Link Administration, mushroom grower Costa Group, retirement developer Gateway Lifestyle and IDP Education, which account for one
third of the $7.1 billion of IPO proceeds since last April, are each up at least 24 per cent.

Floated by private equity, Link listed in October, after raising $946 million at $6.37 a share. It hit a record $8.02 last week and finished Friday at $7.88,
capitalising the group at $2.8 billion.

An unlikely duo, however, have proved the big winners.

Skincare company BWX, little known until a $39 million IPO in October, has trebled its issue price of $1.50, last trading at $4.57 on Friday.

China-based citrus grower Dongfang Modern Agriculture also raised $39.2 million, in May, for the biggest-ever listing on the Australia Securities Exchange of a
company operating solely in China. Issued at $1, its shares are up 145 per cent at $2.45.

Agriculture has proved an attractive lure for investors.

Costa is at $2.95, having raised its $551 million cash at $2.25, while smaller peer Beston Global Food has put on 24 per cent, from 35¢ to 43.5¢.

But there have been profits in a string of other medium-sized floats, including QMS Media (up 98 per cent), telco Superloop (90 per cent), car cooling system
provider PWR Holdings (64 per cent) and baby products retailer Baby Bunting (71 per cent).

And clean technology minnow Hazer deserves mention, converting a 20¢ issue price into a last trade of 67¢.

There have also been plenty of disappointments, with 32 of the 81 IPOs listed by Bloomberg under water.

McGrath is a notable miss, losing 47 per cent after hitting up investors for $129 million in the lead-up to Christmas.

Perth-based livestock exporter Wellard is down 44 per cent, crunched after a profit downgrade last month. Sold to incoming investors at $1.39 a share in
November, the stock is wallowing at 77.5¢.

Mortgage broker Australian Finance Group has also struggled for traction, with its shares down 14 per cent since listing.
