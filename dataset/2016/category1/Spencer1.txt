■ THE final price for a West Melbourne mixed-use development site almost doubled from the opening
bid of $5 million, as investors clamoured for properties in the fringe CBD suburb.
Sold for $9.4 million at auction in front of a crowd of more than 100 people, CBRE said serious buyers
for the 137-157 Adderley St site included five local and offshore groups.

The winning bidder, Auburn Property Group, secured the 1597sq m corner property on a rate of
$5886 per square metre.
CBRE said the sale marked its ninth major deal in West Melbourne over the past 12 months.

“Smart developers are recognising that for $5000 to $6000 a square metre they can acquire a
prominent landholding, less than 500m from the CBD,” the commercial agency said.

“This is particularly appealing when compared to other city fringe markets such as Richmond,
Southbank and East Melbourne, where land rates are typically in excess of $15,000 a square metre.” In
the past six months, CBRE has transacted the following West Melbourne development site deals: 143
& 145-147 Rosslyn St, for $2.6 million to a Chinese buyer; 371 Spencer St for $5.5 million to a local
investor; 102 Jeffcott St for $6.1 million also to a local investor; 33-43 Dudley St for $12.1 million to a
Chinese developer; and 405-409 Spencer St for $12.7 million, also to a Chinese investor.

DEMAND RISING ■ COLLIERS International is also fielding strong interest for West Melbourne sites,
with a record price of $14.6 million achieved for 407 King St to an Asian developer.
The property’s prime location close to Flagstaff Gardens and Flagstaff railway station, the new
Haileybury College campus plus the Queen Victoria Market, generated fierce interest from
owner-occupiers, investors and developers, the commercial agency said.

Colliers said that traditionally, sales for West Melbourne development sites averaged around
$11,000/sq m, but 407 King St had collected $15,800/sq m, demonstrating huge demand for CBD
properties from overseas buyers.
MITCHAM SALE ■ CVA Property has privately sold an industrial investment at Unit 7, 621 Whitehorse
Rd, Mitcham, to a syndicate of local and European investors for $3.45 million.
The 1460sq m property is leased to Aneeta Windows, which was recently bought by US-based
Jeld-Wen Windows and Doors, which owns Stegbar Windows.
CVA said that it received more than 50 inquires for the property. Heritage haven ■ A PRIVATE
investor has paid $1.3 million for a double-storey heritage building at 111 Bridge Rd, Richmond.

vacancy rate of retail premises on Bridge Rd, investment interest remains strong in the city-fringe
location”, the agency said.
A temporary tenancy is in place at the 127sq m property, which has a 75sq m ground-level shop and
first-floor office/storage area of 47sq m.

Fitzroys said retail and office inquiries had spiked since March.
CUE TIME BUYS IN ■ US indoor sports firm Cue Time has paid $2.9 million for a near-new industrial
property at 1/86-102 Whiteside Rd, Clayton South, according to selling agent Savills Australia.
The property, built by Virtus Property Group, is a 2032sq m facility including a 1632sq m warehouse
and 400sq m of office space.
Formerly a tenant of the property on a 10-year term, Cue Time decided to become an owner-occupier
of the site.

Savills said that for some tenants “the buying versus leasing argument have swung in favour of buying,
particularly with interest rates low and likely to remain low”.

Cue Time operates a competition complex for badminton, table tennis and other sports.

QUAN AT SAVILLS ■ IN other Savills Australia news, the agency’s Melbourne office has added to its
residential projects team. It has appointed Wayne Quan.
Mr Quan, an off-the-plan apartment sales expert, joins Savills after seven years at Melbourne-based
property investment company Ironfish.Savills said Mr Quan “has a strong international client base”.
