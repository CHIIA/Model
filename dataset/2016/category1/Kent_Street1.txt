Sydney-based private hotel company Staywell Hospitality Group has sold its Park Regis Hotel in the
Sydney CBD to a Chinese private capital group for $46 million.

The new owner bought the hotel through its operating company, Melbourne-based financial planning
company Cornerstone Capital.

The same private equity group is also currently in exclusive due diligence to buy the residential
development-approved 333 Kent Street building for $90 million. Park Regis is its second acquisition
in the last few weeks.

The 122-room hotel at 27 Park Street was sold with a long 15-year management agreement to the
private equity group, which acquired the Park Regis because its replacement value was attractive
given the low hotel stock in the Sydney CBD.

Hotel investments such as the Park Regis are hard to come by in Sydney, with many investors
holding on to tight stock.

Hotels for sale have been snapped up at top prices in recent times as seen with the $445 million
sale of the landmark Westin Hotel to Singapore's Far East Organization and Hong Kong's Sino
Group and the Sydney Hilton Hotel sold to Singapore-based Bright Ruby for $442 million last year.

It is understood Park Regis' new owner has been in business in Australia for about eight years, and
is backing the Salter Brothers' investment in the $500 million IHG Hotel portfolio acquired from
Eureka Funds Management late year.

The portfolio of hotels includes the Intercontinental Hotel in Melbourne, Crowne Plaza Melbourne,
Crowne Plaza Coogee, Crowne Plaza Canberra and Holiday Inn Potts Point, and is now owned by
the Salter Brothers and property investor Lorenz Grollo's joint SB&G Hotel Group.

Staywell Hospitality in the meantime is targeting more Asian property acquisitions and is in
discussions to develop new hotels in Perth, Adelaide and Darwin as it seeks to build a 100-strong
hotel chain and a near $500 million balance sheet within three years, the group told the Australian
Financial Review two years ago.

Staywell currently operates 35 hotels under its Park Regis and Leisure Inn brands, in Australia,
India, Singapore, Bali and Dubai. It has also expanded to New Zealand and the UK and is looking at
expansions to China.

partner at Baker & Mackenzie.

Colliers International's Raymond Tran and Gus Moors, who handled the sale of Park Regis, declined
to comment.
