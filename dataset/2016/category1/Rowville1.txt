■ CONSTRUCTION of Ranfurlie Developments’ 25,000sq m shopping centre in the southwest
corridor suburb of Tarneit is about to start.

Sited in the Wyndham municipality 25km west of the CBD, the complex will be anchored by a
national supermarket, discount department store and supermarket and 42 specialty retailers.

The Tarneit Central Shopping Centre project, which will have 935 car spaces, marks the first leg of
a multi-staged town centre development, according to Colliers International leasing agent Mike
Crittenden.

The fast-growing area has more than 188,000 residents, with Victorian government projections
putting the expected population at more than 220,000 by 2017.
Ranfurlie is the retail and commercial brand of the Dennis Family, one of the property industry’s
largest new-home builders.
The company has completed and opened another sub-regional retail project in Cranbourne East,
the Hunt Club Village Shopping Centre.
The Tarneit centre is close to two Dennis Family residential developments, Rose Grange and
Westbrook.

OPEN TO OPTIONS ■ SUTHERLAND Farrelly has auctioned an older-style factory/warehouse at
43 Provost St, North Melbourne, for $1.95 million.
Just 2km northwest of the CBD, the property has good access to major arterials including CityLink,
the West Gate Freeway and Flemington Rd.
The 310sq m building has two street frontages and is in a mixed-use zone. Sold with a short-term
lease expiring in August next year, marketing agent Paul Farrelly said the property could eventually
be redeveloped into multiple residences.

“Demand for city-fringe, boutique development opportunities was at an all-time high, with this
campaign generating in excess of 100 inquiries,” Mr Farrelly said.
ARCHITECTS BUY IN ■ SHOP 1 at 96 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, in the mixed-use Elmington
development has been sold by Fitzroys at a rate of more than $6000 a square metre.

Elmington development has 485sq m of shops at ground level with 65 apartments above. The prime
commercial site is near the popular Camberwell Junction retail precinct.
ROOM WITH A VIEW ■ A BUILDING containing two shops and a first-floor apartment with
stunning St Kilda views has been sold for $1.66 million by Gross Waddell and Danaher Realty.
The property at 167 Fitzroy St netted a yield of 4.4 per cent on passing income of $74,000 a year,
with a potential for $95,500 when fully leased.
A bayside investor bought the corner property.

FOREIGN INVESTOR ■ SEVEN out of 10 formal offers for a Camberwell childcare centre came
from overseas investors, Savills Australia has said.
The centre, at 164-168 Warrigal Rd, was bought by a Chinese national for $6.82 million.

This was $400,000 above the reserve.
Another China-based investor paid $2.3 million on a 5.1 per cent yield for a childcare centre at
Rowville.
The Camberwell centre’s price netted a slightly better yield of 5.05 per cent. Opposite Wattle Park
Primary School, the 547sq m modern centre is on a 2065sq m site with three frontages and 24 car
spaces.
It was sold subject to a 10-year lease plus a 10-year option to national operator Affinity Educational
Group, which pays rent of $344,986 a year.
