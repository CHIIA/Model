LP  2016 APR 26 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at China Weekly News -- An executive delegation led by Hao Hongfeng, chairman of

TD  McHenry Hohnen owner David Hohnen and partner Murray McHenry gave the delegation a warm reception at which Mr. Hohnen said, "We are pleased to

welcome the management team of Jiuxian.com to McHenry Hohnen. We are fully aware of Jiuxian.com's reputation as China's largest vertical alcohol e-
commerce company and one that hastens of millions of members. We are pleased to reach a strategic cooperation with Jiuxian.com, a firm which has rich
experience in the Chinese alcohol market and proven brand promotion capabilities. We believe that the partnership with Jiuxian.com will serve to widen
McHenry Hohnen's fan base in China."

Mr. Hao explained some of the retailer's background: "Founded six years ago, Jiuxian.com is now a leading Chinese vertical alcohol e-commerce company
with rich experience in management and a strong channel strategy. Jiuxian.com expects to build a bridge connecting Chinese consumers with fine wines from
Australia. Our win-win cooperation starts now."

Through the partnership with McHenry Hohnen, Jiuxian.com plans to introduce the wine maker's popular Rocky Road category to Chinese wine lovers. Rocky
Road was rated a 94 by Australia's leading wine expert James Halliday, who, in his review of the wine, categorized it as an excellent value as a result of the
high quality at a manageable price, and as one that merits being among the offerings at a sophisticated wine tasting event.

The visit to Australia is a key step in the execution of Jiuxian.com's global wine direct purchase strategy. Since 2015, Jiuxian.com has been developing its wine
business rapidly by choosing among high-quality wine products worldwide and enriching its production lines as a result of the initiation of the strategy of dealing
directly with leading wine producers around the world. In 2016, Jiuxian.com's wine business is expected to contribute to 20 percent of the retailer's total annual
revenue.

Jiuxian.com decided to develop a global direct purchase strategy once the retailer noticed the continuing increase in the consumption of wine by the Chinese
public. Data from China Customs show that the country imported nearly 600 million liters of wine in 2015, a rise of 44.58 percent over the numbers for 2014.
The import value of wine grew by 34.30 percent year-on-year, setting a new record.

Jiuxian.com expects to reach a strategic partnership with more than ten five-star wineries during the visit to Western Australia. Jiuxian.com plans to bring these
fine wines to Chinese consumers by purchasing wine products directly from wine producers all over the world, providing Chinese wine lovers the opportunity to
buy affordable foreign fine wines in their own country.
