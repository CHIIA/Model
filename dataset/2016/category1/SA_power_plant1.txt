Surging electricity prices for industrial customers in South Australia have triggered plans for a new
gas-fired power station between local junior Leigh Creek Energy and giant Chinese equipment
manufacturer Shanghai Electric.
Leigh Creek managing director David Shearwood said the ASX-listed company had altered the shape
of its integrated energy project, planned at the Leigh Creek coal deposit 550 kilometres north of
Adelaide, to be able to supply electricity to industrial customers facing huge increases in power costs
due to the closure of Alinta's power stations at Port Augusta.

The power plant would have a capacity of 300 megawatts to 600MW, costing between $450 million
and $900 million, depending on the final capacity, Mr Shearwood said. Start-up is targeted for early
2019, with all power to be sold under long-term contracts with customers.
Leigh Creek's business strategy centres on a proposal to produce gas from the underground coal
deposit using a controversial process known as in-situ gasification. Some of the gas would be used in
the power plant and for fertiliser production, and the rest transported through a new pipeline to supply
east coast markets.
The heads of agreement signed with Hong Kong-listed Shanghai Electric provides for the two to work
together to set up a joint venture in South Australia that would construct, own and run the gas-fired
generator.
The equity split between the partners, funding and arrangements for electricity sales have still to be
determined.

The venture aims to construct a generator to provide cheaper and reliable electricity to industry and
mines in South Australia, according to Justyn Peters, executive chairman of Leigh Creek. The
company's shares surged 16.7 per cent in morning trading.

Leigh Creek, formed through a back-door listing last year using the shell of the former Marathon
Resources, is about 7.5 per cent owned by China's CITIC.
Mr Peters said the deal was "a great first step" in Leigh Creek's development as an energy company.

"The generation of base-load power through a gas-fired power station is important both to our
company and to South Australia," he said.

an investment approaching $2 billion.
In-situ gasification involves heating coal underground, to produce methane and other usable gases.
