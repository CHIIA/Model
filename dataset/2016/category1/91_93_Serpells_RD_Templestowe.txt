LP  FOREIGN buyers splashed out up to $25 billion on residential property in Victoria in the last financial year — substantially more than in any other state.

The Foreign Investment Review Board’s latest annual report reveals 16,587 offshore buyers were given the go-ahead to buy new and existing homes, vacant
land and properties for development in the state in 2014-15.

TD  The figure was well up on the previous financial year, in which 9979 foreigners were allowed to snap up $14 billion worth of Victorian real estate.

The FIRB report — which details how many offshore buyer applications were approved and their dollar value, but not actual completed sales — also reveals
almost $97 billion worth of real estate investment by foreigners was authorised in Australia in 2014-15. The Chinese had the biggest appetite for Aussie homes
for the second consecutive year.

Approved Chinese investment in Australian residential and commercial real estate has now doubled for two years running, reaching $24.35 billion in the last
financial year.

This was more than triple the outlay from US buyers.

CONTINUED PAGE 4 FROM PAGE 1 Real estate agents in Melbourne’s middle eastern suburbs say Asian buyers have driven their property markets more
than any other group over the past two years.

“Chinese buyers are ... making property sales more competitive, and that has to increase prices,” Jellis Craig Doncaster director Dallas Taylor said.

Mark Brown, director of Stockdale & Leggo’s Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley offices, said his suburbs had become “two of the hottest spots for real estate
in Australia”, with their median house prices “skyrocketing” over the past few years.

“That’s being driven by foreign buyers, whether they’re here to stay or investing,” he said. “Quite often money doesn’t become an issue for them — it’s about
pride. They think, ‘I’m here to buy the property at whatever price’. The vendors love it.” Buyer’s advocate Frank Valentic said while Chinese investment was
“boosting our economy”, it wasn’t so positive for those trying to buy into parts of Melbourne.

“If you’re trying to get into the market and you’re getting beaten by an overseas buyer every week, it’s a negative,” he said. The FIRB report shows that after
Victoria, the next most popular state with offshore buyers was NSW, where 12,079 foreigners spent up to $19.7 billion on residential real estate.

Of the $25.07 billion worth of foreign property investment approved in Victoria in 2014-15, $5.55 billion was to be spent on established homes, split among
4664 offshore buyers.

Of this, $840 million worth was approved for 575 foreigners who intended to demolish the existing dwellings and redevelop new ones.

“These are normally approved as long as the redevelopment increases Australia’s housing stock, (with) at least two dwellings built for the one demolished,” the
report said.
