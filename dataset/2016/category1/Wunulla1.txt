The secretive owner of Australia’s most famous trophy home, Altona, in Point Piper in Sydney’s eastern
suburbs, has decided to carve up the estate in a move described as “sacrilege’’.
Chinese property developer Wang Zhijun has excised 1100sq m of the 54 Wunulla Road waterfront in a
deal that could fetch him as much as $19 million.
In an apparent bid to avoid foreign investment review board scrutiny, Mr Wang paid $52m for the harbourside
mansion through a complex holding structure using Chaimovich Investments as the holding company in
2013.

...
Rosaline Ho of Goldfield & Co has been appointed to sell the vacant waterfront site, which includes a
slipway. Rival eastern suburbs agents estimated the vacant block could fetch between $15m and $19m.
Agent Bill Bridges foreshadowed the site would sell at the lower end of the scale. “It’s a pretty awkward block
(with) covenants on it,” he said.
“I think it’s been on the market for a long time. The sale will devalue Altona, most definitely — it’s sacrilege.
And you would be restricted to what you could build on it.” Mr Wang has developed luxury property, mines
and golf courses in mainland China. It is understood the vacant block was purchased for $6.25m by a former
Altona owner Matt Handbury around 1994.
If the sale proceeds, the eight-bedroom Altona mansion will sit on about 1300sq m of grounds.

...
These days, however, it is better known among China’s uber wealthy as an entertainment venue for Chinese
princelings.Ms Ho was unavailable for comment yesterday.
