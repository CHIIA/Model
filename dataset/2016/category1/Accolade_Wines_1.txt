Accolade's advisers and executives reckon they are a good bet given how enamoured China's elite
are becoming with the booming sales of Treasury Wine Estates and its big brands Penfolds and
Wolf Blass in Asia.

As Street Talk revealed on Thursday, Accolade management and CHAMP Private Equity
representatives will be in Hong Kong and China next week for a series of meetings to introduce
Accolade to potential institutional investors ahead of the IPO in the first half of 2017.

It's understood the team will also press the flesh with Chinese strategic players with a view towards
securing pre-prospectus cornerstone commitments.

Australia's wine exports to mainland China have climbed 50 per cent in the past 12 months to $419
million. Accolade management and top brass from 80 per cent owner CHAMP will point to the rising
sales to Asia of some of Accolade's key brands, such as Hardys and Grant Burge.

It's understood Accolade's pitch will note that China will be the world's largest market for imported
wine in the next five years and that the drinking population in China is increasing by a staggering 10

for wine exports.

Mainland China is the No.2 export destination for Australian wine behind the United States, and is
on course to overtake it over the next year if current growth rates continue.

CHAMP and Accolade's 20 per cent shareholder, the New York-listed alcoholic beverages giant
Constellation Brands, are each likely to retain a small stake in the business after listing.

The doubling in share price of rival Treasury Wine Estates in less than two years since late 2014 is
likely to result in strong interest from investors in the IPO. Accolade generates annual net profit after
tax of between $70 million and $75 million. It produces 37 million cases of wine annually from an
array of brands.

Corporate advisory boutique Reunion Capital Partners won the role of independent advisor for the
Accolade IPO in August as revealed by The Australian Financial Review.
