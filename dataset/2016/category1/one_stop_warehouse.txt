TD  SUZHOU, China, April 18, 2016

SUZHOU, China, April 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On 15(th) April, GCL System Integration Technology (Hereinafter referred to as GCL-SI) signed an agreement
with Australia ONE STOP WAREHOUSE PTY LTD (Hereinafter referred to as OSW) that GCL-SI owns a 51% stake of OSW. Both have also come to an
agreement in sales distribution, strategic development and future business planning, etc.

Under the huge pressure of Europe and America's "anti-dumping & anti-subsidy" policy to the photovoltaic industry, an increasing number of PV corporations in
China strive to march into overseas markets in avoidance of Europe and America's "double-anti" policy. GCL-SI's successful acquisition of OSW is a crucial
step for GCL-SI to enter the global market.

The aim of GCL-SI's acquisition of OSW is to strategically enter the global market and develop its own product layout and distributed PV integration unit. Apart
from the core business segments, GCL-SI strives to develop new businesses, such as carbon emission reduction and energy storage, etc. for new profit
growth and its rapidly sustainable development.

OSW is an Australian PV corporation active in PV system. Its four distribution centers are widely scattered in the whole of Australia. Besides, OSW develops e-
commerce, operation and mobile platforms by itself. In the first 11 months of last year, OSW, with sales of 45.145 million Australian Dollars, reported a net profit
of 1.78 million Australian Dollars.
