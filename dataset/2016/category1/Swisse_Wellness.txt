HEALTH RADEK Sali, the effervescent chief executive of vitamins empire Swisse Wellness, will leave
within weeks the group he has spent almost a third of his life transforming.

Mr Sali, 40, yesterday tendered his resignation to the board of Swisse after 12 years at the company
and nine as its chief.

Swisse will be led by ex-Treasury Wine Estates and Wolf Blass executive Oliver Horn from January.

The announcement comes as Swisse’s new owner, Hong Kong-based investment company Biostime
International Holdings, moves to full ownership after buying out the remaining 17 per cent, including
Mr Sali’s stake. Biostime fended off two Chinese bidders to net Swisse in a $1.67 billion deal in
September last year.

Mr Sali, a BRW Young Rich lister with an estimated net worth of $405 million, told Business Daily he
was leaving with some sadness after “an amazing ride”.

“I’m very proud of where the business has ended up. I feel like the business needs someone to drive it
to the next stage,” he said.

Mr Sali said he was keen to devote time to his not-for-profit Lightfolk Foundation, co-founded with wife
Helen, and a wellness retreat it is developing at Red Hill on the Mornington Peninsula.

Collingwood-based Swisse was founded in the 1970s by Melbourne-based organic baker Kevin Ring,
who also had a passion for herbal supplements. His son Stephen formed a business partnership with
Mr Sali to boost the group’s profile.A heavy marketing push, which saw the likes of Nicole Kidman,
Lleyton Hewitt and Ricky Ponting promoting the brand, paid off as Swisse expanded into New
Zealand, Europe and China.
