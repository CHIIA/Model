Australian iron ore explorer Athena Resources Ltd. has struck a deal with Hong Kong-based Brilliant Glory
Industrial Corp. Ltd. for a A$1.0 million placement and option to buy the Byro iron ore project in Western
Australia.   
The company said Jan. 8 that Brilliant Glory has agreed to subscribe for 15 million shares at 2 Australian
cents apiece and 28 million shares at 2.5 cents apiece.

...
The Hong Kong investor has also been granted the right to purchase the Byro project for a A$20.0 million
cash payment.
The sale is conditional upon Athena undertaking the necessary works to obtain two mining leases for the
project, as well as securing all necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals.
Under the deal, Athena will also be entitled to a royalty of A$2 per dry tonne of iron ore sold from Byro.
The company expects to convene a general meeting in the first quarter of 2016 to obtain the necessary
shareholder and regulatory approvals.
