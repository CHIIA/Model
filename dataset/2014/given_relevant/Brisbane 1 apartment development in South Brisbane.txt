SINGAPORE

* Fitch Ratings said S-REITs are "likely" to issue more perpetual securities in 2016 to raise funds for asset
development and improve their balance sheets. The said move is expected to take place because the city-
state's regulator narrowed the cap on leverage for the sector, there is a potential increase in long-term interest
rates and most sectors are expected to suffer from "weaker" operation conditions that could put asset values
under pressure in 2016.

and Keppel REIT as those who issued perpetual securities for growth in 2015.
