LP  A group of  Chinese  businessmen have bought the failed Cairn Hill  iron ore  mine from the liquidator of Termite

Resources, one of the first companies to go bust last year at the start of the  iron  price tumble, which has worsened
considerably in the past few months.

Cu-River  Mining  has acquired the mine near Coober Pedy in northern South Australia for an undisclosed price,
adding to some nearby exploration tenements it bought in September 2014 from the liquidator, Ferrier Hodgson.
Those tenements are known as the Mt Woods  iron ore  project.

TD  Cu-River  Mining  is an entity set up in Australia in June 2014 and its president is listed as Yonggang Shan.

Termite's assets have been liquidated by Ferrier Hodgson, which was appointed administrator in June 2014, when
the  iron ore  price was $US89 ($116.82) a tonne. It is now $US47 a tonne. Termite operated the mine for less than
four years before it collapsed, throwing 200 people out of work.

Termite was 51 per cent-owned by ASX-listed IMX Resources, with the other 49 per cent owned by  China 's Taifeng
Yuanchang International Development. IMX had a market capitalisation of $200  million  in December 2010 as the
first shipments of  iron ore  were made from Cairn Hill, 55km from the opal  mining  centre Coober Pedy.

Ferrier Hodgson partner Martin Lewis said Cu-River had continued to invest in Australian  iron ore  assets and it
was a positive outcome, given the conditions facing  iron ore  miners.

Ferrier Hodgson wouldn't comment on the price tag of the  iron ore  mine.

The transaction has been approved by the South Australian government, the federal Treasurer and the Department
of Defence.

The Mt Woods tenements comprise eight exploration licences covering about 3400 square kilometres, about 50
kilometres south of Coober Pedy. The  acquisition  by Cu-River of those tenements in September 2014 for $3.7
million  enabled IMX to pay $3  million  to extinguish a liability to Flinders Ports, which operates most of South
Australia's ports. Termite was exporting  iron ore  through Flinders ports.

Cairn Hill was a high-cost mine but was able to prosper initially at a time of much higher  iron ore  prices. The  iron
ore  price averaged about $US135 a tonne during 2013.
