LP  Guangzhou-based R&F Properties plans to spend $500 million acquiring sites in Australia over the next five

years, continuing its development push outside of China, according to deputy general manager Vincent Chen.

The group which has a listed arm in Hong Kong with a market value of $4.7 billion, has amassed four sites in
Brisbane and Melbourne, last week launching a $400m apartment complex at South Brisbane. Brisbane 1, a 30-
level project of 600 apartments, is R&F Properties’ first venture in the Australian development  market.

TD  “While we have plans to expand into other capital cities, Brisbane is our current focus as a booming city with

robust potential for population growth and development,” he said. “We will continue to invest in development in
Brisbane as it evolves towards New World City status.” R&F made a dramatic entry into the Australian market
last year when it bought two approved sites from Brisbane-based Metro Property Development paying $45m,
almost double what the local company had spent less than a year earlier. Marketing began on the project
through CBRE last week at a starting price of $345,000 for a one-bedroom unit with three-bedroom apartments
priced around $1.14m.

R&F, which has completed shopping centres, office buildings and five star hotels in China including a Ritz
Carlton, Grand Hyatt and Park Hyatt’s in Guangzhou, says it has plans to expand outside of China and has also
flagged Malaysia as a destination.

In 2013, its Hong Kong-listed company paid 4.5 billion ringgit ($1.4bn) for six commercial and residential sites
totalling 47ha in the Malaysian state of Johor Bahru in its first acquisition abroad.

In Australia, in addition to the South Brisbane property, it has purchased two other sites in the city and one in
Melbourne which are included in the $500m acquistion target.

Earlier this month R&F Properties submitted plans for a 1400-apartment project on the Kinnears Ropeworks site
in Melbourne’s Footscray. The group last year bought the 3.3ha parcel for $60m from Richard Gu’s AXF Group
in a deal brokered by CBRE. If approved it would be one of Melbourne’s largest apartment projects, with the
designs being undertaken by Elenberg Fraser. The apartments will be spread across eight buildings ranging
from five to 18 storeys.Mr Chen said R&F hoped to release further details on the project early next year. Tourism
and population growth made Australia attactive, Mr Chen noted.
