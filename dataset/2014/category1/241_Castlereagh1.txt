Gu pays $18.5m for prime Sydney site

The site, 241 Castlereagh St, overlooks Sydney’s Hyde Park. AFR

Chinese billionaire Richard Gu ’s AXF Group has paid $18.5 million to secure a prime
development site overlooking’s Sydney’s Hyde Park.

The developer, which has a large portfolio of residential projects under way in Sydney
and Melbourne, acquired the existing six-storey ofﬁce building at 241 Castlereagh
Street on a 500-square-metre site from Sydney lawyer John  Landerer . Mr Landerer,
the managing director of  commercial law ﬁrm Landerer & Co., paid $6 million for the
ofﬁce building 10 years ago.

He told The Australian Financial Review he had received a number of off-market,
unsolicited offers for the building. The site, which overlooks the southern side of Hyde
Park, is likely to form part of a future apartment project.

“[Apart from AXF], I also received offers from the owner of an adjoining site and from
someone else who wanted it as part of a bigger development site," Mr Landerer said.

The multiple off-market offers for the ofﬁce tower demonstrate the level of appetite
for residential development sites in and around the Sydney central business district.

Lend Lease has sold more than $800 million worth of apartments off-the-plan for
residential towers at  Barangaroo and Darling Harbour at rates as high as $40,000 per
square metre. Chinese developer Greenland has notched up $415 million worth of
apartment sales for its mixed-use, high-rise project on the former Sydney Water Board
site in the CBD.
