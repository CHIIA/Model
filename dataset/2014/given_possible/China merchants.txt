17 Jul 2014 05:38 ET China Merchants in Talks to Buy Stake in Australian Ports

By Daniel Stacey
SYDNEY--China Merchants Group Ltd. is in talks to buy a large stake in four Australian container ports,
the latest push by Asian investors to own infrastructure vital to regional trade networks, a person familiar
with the situation said.

China Merchants is seeking to buy a majority stake in Asciano Ltd.'s Patrick Terminals and Logistics
business, which runs international container terminals in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, the
person said.

However, recent discussions with Asciano over a deal worth around 1.1 billion Australian dollars
(US$1.03 billion) have foundered because the Australian transport group is reluctant to sell more than a
49% stake and cede control of the business, the person said.

Asciano is being advised by Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan on the process to sell the stake, which is
code-named "Project Guinness," the person said. While talks with China Merchants have taken place on
and off for two years, Asciano recently signed a 60-day memorandum of understanding with the
state-owned Chinese conglomerate to progress a deal, the person added.

An Asciano spokesperson didn't reply to a request to comment. China Merchants declined to comment.

China Merchants, which owns property and banking businesses, has long viewed Australian export
infrastructure as an attractive investment.

In April, China Merchants was part of a consortium that successfully bid A$1.75 billion for a 99-year
lease on the Port of Newcastle in eastern Australia put up for sale by the New South Wales state
government. The port exports coal produced by mining companies including Glencore PLC, Peabody
Energy Corp. and Rio Tinto PLC.

shipping company. In May, CMA CGM lost out in bidding for the rights to build a new A$1.6 billion
container terminal in Melbourne.

Patrick's ports business is valued at around A$2.2 billion, the person said. The business generated
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of A$198 million in the fiscal year through
June, 2013, or 19% of Asciano's profits as a whole.

Still, the ports operation is facing headwinds as Australian state governments seek to inject competition
into the sector and bring down freight costs for local businesses.

In 2008, the Port of Brisbane Corp. signed up Hong Kong-based ports operator Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
to build a third container terminal. A year later, Sydney Ports Corp. also signed a deal with Hutchison
Whampoa to expand capacity at Port Botany. Another foreign investor-- International Container Terminal
Services Inc., based in the Philippines--won a contract in May as part of a consortium to build a third
container terminal in Melbourne.

These new terminals will all compete with Patrick's ports and could crimp profit margins, the person said.

Asciano previously put its ports business up for sale in 2009, as management tried to raise funds to
repair its balance sheet. China Merchants's former chairman Fu Yuning publicly expressed interest in
the port assets two years later.

In Australia, China Merchants also owns the country's second largest provider of wooden pallets,
Loscam Ltd. It bought the business from private-equity firm Affinity Equity Partners in 2010.
