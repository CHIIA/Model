Foreign investors needed to expand agribusiness

When large rural areas are able to access the NBN, the ability of producers to monitor and manage their vast
properties will come down to a few keystrokes on a computer. Glenn Campbell

Satisfying the new fussy eaters requires an enormous investment in IT to take full
advantage of the digital revolution that awaits farmers who will go "NBN-live" next
year, says National Farmers' Federation chief executive Simon Talbot.

"We are not using the available science enough to scale up our food production . . . and
to realise our potential we need foreign investment," he says.

The science that is missing on farms is pinpoint precision digital monitoring. When
large rural areas are able to access the NBN, thanks to the satellite launches the
broadband company is undertaking, Talbot says the ability of producers to monitor
and manage their vast properties will come down to a few keystrokes on a computer.

"What you will see is fenceline data beamed up and over to your electronic device. You
will be able to check on pasture growth rates in different parts of your property, see
which parts need more water, where you need to fertilise more, where your livestock
is and how the health of each individual animal is looking, without leaving the ofﬁce.".

The data will help boost farm-gate returns to the extent that food production will be
considered "sexier", says Talbot, who reports that already farmers are seeing the
potential of agribusiness, as a growing concern over food security escalates in Asia.

Absence of sovereign risk

Commonwealth Bank managing director of industrials and agriculture markets Peter
McGregor says Australian businesses appeal to Asian investors because of the quality
of our produce, services and the absence of sovereign risk.

When the China Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership get under
way, the opportunities for Australian businesses to beneﬁt will be signiﬁcant,
McGregor says.

"I reiterate the point that these free trade agreements will produce major
opportunities for Australia.

"Right now, the Chinese market is the biggest consumer of exported red wine. In the
Home
past decade, consumption patterns in that nation have changed as a growing
middle class pays more attention to what it eats and where it comes from.

"There is a growing demand out of Asia for more meat and wine, plus more value-
added and processed foodstuffs, such as infant formula.

"Australian producers have much to gain in satisfying the changing consumption
patterns in our region, but they need investors in order to scale up to meet the
challenge."

No one recognises the potential of Australian produce more than the investors with a
close-up understanding of how consumption in their domestic markets is evolving.

Churchill

Several large institutional and private investors have already grabbed a piece of this
action with full or partial takeovers. The deals include Taihua Food's joint venture
with Churchill Abattoir to make the Australian meat processor's plant export-grade;
Hailang Organic Farming Company spending $40 million on Queensland cattle and
cropping properties; and a private Chinese company buying a 205,000-hectare
Northern Territory cattle station.

PriceWaterhouse Coopers' China desk leader, Kai Zhang, told The Australian Financial
Review the private-sector clients he is advising on food and agricultural deals are
mostly property developers and building materials companies looking to shift their
capital base abroad, given the headwinds in the Chinese construction sector.

"I won't be surprised if some of Australia's most iconic food and beverage companies
become subject to Chinese take-overs in the next 12 months,"  Zhang says.

"I recently advised China's Landbridge Group on its acquisition of Darwin Port. We are
very conﬁdent in the growth of food and agricultural exports between northern
Australia and China.

"This sector is attractive to Asian investors because of Australia's logistical and
proximity advantage, favourable political and legal environment, and freehold
ownership, which is not available in China."

But China's play in the food sector has been tiny compared to commercial property,
Home
which last year swallowed 46 per cent of total Chinese investment in Australia. The
biggest deals last year, however, were buyouts of industrial and resources companies.
Infrastructure investment absorbed 21 per cent of Chinese capital, resources 18 per
cent, leisure and retail 12 per cent, while agribusiness and manufacturing took up 1
per cent and 2 per cent respectively.

A KPMG study, Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia, reported that in 2014
four megadeals were sealed with Chinese investors for a combined outlay of $4
billion. The targets were cinema giant Hoyts, John Holland Group, the Port of
Newcastle and Aquila Resources.

Among the drivers behind an increasing Chinese appetite for Australian companies is
the desire to become more nimble.

"Overseas investments are helping more Chinese companies from more sectors
access new markets and acquire the experience, technology, brands and human
capital necessary to become more competitive," KPMG says.

The cloud on the horizon could be if there is any change in foreign investment rules.
