HONG Kong-listed shares in the Australian-managed MMG were placed in a trading halt yesterday
after shooting 8 per cent higher on renewed speculation that it was involved in a deal to acquire the
$US6 billion ($6.61bn) Las Bambas copper project in Peru from GlencoreXstrata.
MMG's 72 per cent parent, the state-owned China Minmetals, has previously confirmed it was in talks
to buy Las Bambas, but MMG has been coy on the subject. It has been assumed MMG would be
involved in any Las Bambas acquisition, but last week MMG chief executive Andrew Michelmore
would not be drawn on the potential deal.

``We don't comment on these matters,'' he said. But he added that MMG ``really likes copper'' and
South America as an investment destination.

``And we are after assets that have a long life and offer decent margins.''

Ahead of yesterday's trading halt, shares in MMG had risen by 18 per cent in seven trading days. The
only other news from the company in the period was a better-than-expected profit for 2013 of
$US122.5 million, albeit down from $US234m in 2012.
Surging nickel prices have also boosted interest in a planned sale by MMG of its mothballed Avebury
nickel mine on Tasmania's west coast, which was developed at a cost of $880m, but no deal is
imminent.
The sale of Las Bambas, which still requires more than $US2bn before first production next year, was
a condition placed by Beijing on last year's merger between Glencore and Xstrata. If the sale is not
achieved by September 30 because a satisfactory price or valuation threshold is not reached, Beijing
can direct GlencoreXstrata to sell one of four other nominated copper assets.

MMG is best known in this market for acquiring the assets of OZ Minerals, other than the Prominent
Hill copper-gold mine in South Australia, when OZ was forced into a drastic debt restructuring in
2007.
MMG's operations include the Century zinc mine in Queensland, the Rosebery zinc operation in
Tasmania and the Golden Grove base and precious metals mines in Western Australia.
