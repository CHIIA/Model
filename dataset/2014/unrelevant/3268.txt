Shanghai and Hong Kong led Asian stocks markets lower on Monday, as weak trade data from China
weighed on regional sentiment, while shares in Malaysia Airlines sank after one of its planes went
missing over the weekend.
Chinese exports sank 18.1% from a year earlier in February, much lower than the 5% increase that was
expected by economists, and following a healthy 10.6% expansion in January. Although the sharp drop
raised concerns over Asia's largest economy, distortions due to the long Lunar New Year holidays could
have contributed to the surprise fall.

"It's hard to ignore a number that looks like that," said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac
Institutional Bank in Sydney. Monday's move is "symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked
by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers."
There were additional signs that the Chinese economy could be running out of steam, as data showed
that Chinese consumer prices rose by 2% year-over-year in February.
In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.6% while the Shanghai Composite in mainland China
was 1.7% lower.
The Chinese currency and copper prices were also hit by the trade data. The yuan fell as low as 6.1594
to the dollar early in the session, compared with Friday's close of 6.1260 in New York, and was last
trading at 6.1402 per dollar.
LME three-month copper prices fell to their lowest levels since June in Asia, and were last trading at
$6,715.25 a metric ton, a 1% decline from Friday's closing price.

Along with weak manufacturing data so far this year, the trade figures became the latest poor economic
number to come out of China. The resulting concerns over the economy have made Chinese stocks
among the region's worst performers in 2014, with the Hang Seng Index down 4.3%
year-to-date--second only to the Nikkei, which is 7% lower over the same period.
Elsewhere in Asia, the impact was felt most in Australia--a country with strong trade ties with China. In
Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.8%. Mining stocks were badly hit, with Rio Tinto losing 5% and BHP
Billiton 3.5% lower.

Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi lost 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei was 0.8% lower after the country posted a
fourth straight month of current-account deficit in January. The yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar
and was last trading at Yen103.12 to the dollar, compared with Yen103.26 late Friday in New York.
The poor data from China overshadowed good economic news from the world's largest economy on
Friday, after data showed that the U.S. created more jobs in February than expected by economists.

AG bid 1.2 billion Australian dollars to increase its controlling stake in Australia's largest construction
company.

In Southeast Asia, Malaysia Airlines' share price dropped 8%, after flight MH370 went missing on early
Saturday with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
