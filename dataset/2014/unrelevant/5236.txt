"Market may fall about 120 points' - Gerald Stanley

Gerald Stanley, a Fibonacci chartist, standing in for Ben Faulkner who is delayed, said, "In my mind the
top is in, demonstrated yesterday when the intra day was the highest high since 2008 and the close failed
to hold above the previous highest close of April 28 this year, which was 5336.1.

"This, plus markets in Europe and the US falling last night on negative news leads me to forecast a fall to
the low of July 1, that is 5370.

"My call is therefore a low of 5370, close of 5400, down 120 points'.

*PBT: Positive response over time from Alzheimer's Phase 2 IMAGINE

Prana Biotechnology Ltd announced Prof Colin Masters, the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental
Health, University of Melbourne will include data from Prana's Phase 2 IMAGINE and EURO trials in his
presentation at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen Denmark (last night,
our time).

The presentation is entitled, "How to change and monitor the rates of A6 amyloid accumulation and
cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease".

The IMAGINE trial top line draft results were released on March 31. Further sub analyses of the top line
imaging data have been performed, including PiB-PET, MRI and FDG analysis of the effects of a once
daily, 250 mg dose of PBT2 over 12 months. IMAGINE enrolled 42 patients, 27 in the PBT2 group and 15
in placebo. In contrast to published literature, the average amyloid burden in the placebo group fell during
the trial. Prana conducted a sub analysis to better understand the behaviour of the placebo group.

Prof Masters on further investigation found the subgroup of PBT2 treated patients with a baseline of
SUVR above 2.5 had a significant decrease in amyooid burden that was not observed in participants on
placebo nor PBT2 participants with a SUVR less than 2.5.

Separately Prana confirmed the top line finding that there is a very promising trend towards the
preservation of brain volume (as measured by MRI) in PBT2 treated patients compared to placebo. (Jul

*Japan authorises restart of two nuclear reactors

Media services report overnight that Japanese authorities have declared that two nuclear reactors meet
new standards put in place after the 2011 Fukushima disaster and are safe enough to be restarted, paving
the way for the revival of the country’s atomic energy industry.

As Japan swelters through another summer of electricity conservation and bills for expensive gas and
coal imports, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pressing for an end to the nuclear shutdown imposed
after an earthquake and tsunami caused a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima power plant.

The Nuclear Regulatory Authority, in a 418-page report released Wednesday, gave Kyushu Electric Co.
preliminary approval to restart its Sendai plant in the southern part of the country.
