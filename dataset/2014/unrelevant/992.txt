Australian minnow Roc Oil has received a "confidential, unsolicited, indicative and incomplete"
takeover proposal from an unnamed party, having earlier agreed to merge with Horizon Oil, the
company revealed on Wednesday (IOD Apr.30'14). The companies signed a merger implementation
deed (MID) in late April in regards to a takeover.

The news sent Horizon shares down 6.58% to settle at A$0.355 (US$0.33) on Wednesday, while Roc
shares gained 7.14% to A$0.60.

The MID includes "no-talk" restrictions and an obligation to notify the other party of any unsolicited
approaches by other companies. Roc did notify Horizon, saying it was relying on the fiduciary
exceptions to the "no-talk" restrictions, Horizon said.

"There is no certainty that the proposal will develop into a formal offer," Roc added.

However, hinting at a possible battle ahead, Horizon added that, were a competing proposal to
emerge, it intends to assess its position, including the preservation of its rights under the MID.

Some of Roc's shareholders -- including its largest, fund manager Allan Gray Australia -- have already
opposed the merger, which they deem unfavorable to Roc, and plan to table a resolution against it at
the firm's extraordinary general meeting on Jul. 11. International fund manager Allan Gray owns a
19.5% stake in Roc. Allan Gray and other shareholders are upset that Roc is not seeking shareholder
approval for the merger with Horizon, even through regulators do not require such approval. The
resolution will seek to give Roc shareholders a vote on the deal.

The MID called for Horizon shareholders to receive 0.724 Roc shares for each Horizon share. The new
entity would have a combined market capitalization of around A$800 million (US$845 million), with
assets spanning Southeast Asia, China and Australasia, and production of slightly more than 15,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day, expected to peak at around 20,000 boe/d by 2020.

Upstream consolidation is on the rise in Australia, and coming in all shapes in sizes. With exploration
costs on the rise, small companies are on the hunt for partners, which was part of the rationale for the
Roc-Horizon deal.
Experts see more corporate oil and gas M&A action on the horizon in Australia, with this year
potentially eclipsing 2011's headline A$1.5 billion (US$1.4 billion) takeover spend (EIF Jun.11'14).
