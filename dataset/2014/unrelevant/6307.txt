TOWERS: Apartment behemoth Mirvac Group and partner Coombes Property Group plan to rise
above the ambitions of Chinese developers and compete with James Packer’s Crown Resorts to build
one of Sydney’s tallest apartment towers, with the City of Sydney to formally consider lifting height
restrictions on the George Street Cinema site where the project is to be based.
In May The Australian revealed plans to create a super-tall apartment tower on the site, which
Coombes purchased from the listed Challenger Financial Services Group in 2009 for $85 million.

At the time it was speculated the tower would be 235m tall with 600 apartments, similar to Chinese
property giant Greenland Holding Group’s 235m Greenland Centre on nearby Bathurst Street.

But Mirvac and Coombes have requested height controls be lifted to 260m to create a single slender
tower rather than two 150m towers that would be allowed under current restrictions. However, Crown’s
proposed casino and apartment tower at Barangaroo would be taller at 275m.

Mirvac declined to comment, but it is understood it hopes to start construction next year, once
approvals are finalised.
In October, Mirvac chief executive Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz told The Australian the group was working as
fast as it could to “get as much stock into the market over the next couple of years that will drive
earnings in 2017”.A City of Sydney spokeswoman said changes to the height limits would be
considered. “The Events Cinema site has a height limit of 150m, but studies showed that a taller,
thinner building was preferable in this location, given the proximity of its neighbours,” she said.
Buildings over 200m in central Sydney are subject to federal approval by Air Safety Australia and the
Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
