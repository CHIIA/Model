0202 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian data released over the course of this week suggest that
underlying conditions in the economy are more robust than the increase in the unemployment rate seen
in July would suggest, says David Plank, strategist at Deutsche Bank. The business conditions and
forward orders components of the NAB monthly business survey posted solid gains in July, while
consumer sentiment has now largely recovered from the post-budget slump, he adds. That said,
sentiment does remain below the levels seen at the end of last year and the start of this year, Plank says.

0200 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/MYR has veered into the daily Bollinger downtrend channel but needs a
close Friday below 3.1730 to confirm this bearish technical signal. Malaysia releases its second-quarter
gross domestic product data at 1000 GMT. A number better than the median forecast of 5.8% growth
could add fuel to the ringgit's rally versus the U.S. dollar. Confirmation of the Bollinger downtrend channel
coming into play would aim USD/MYR toward the base of the weekly Ichimoku Cloud at 3.1530.
USD/MYR is at 3.1720 vs Thursday's close of 3.1770. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0148 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is down 0.2% at 15286.96 on profit-taking after four straight days of
gains and a 3.6% advance. Volume remains light at just 500 million shares due to the continuing (Aug.
13-15) 'Obon' mid-summer holiday, during which many traders take time off. "With volume so light and
incentives so few, the selling we're seeing today is nothing more than rudimentary after a stretch of
strong gains," says Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. "It's
entirely possible, however, that even following the resumption of 'normal' trading next week, overall
market movements will remain somewhat subdued, as U.S. Treasury rates remain depressed and there
are few incentives--either positive or negative--on which big investors will trade. Expectations from the
government pension fund (GPIF) about increasing its equity buying may be largely factored in by now; it
would take a really big number (a hike of well over 20% in its domestic stock exposure) to excite the
market now." (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0134 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/SGD appears to be consolidating near the bottom of the Ichimoku Cloud
support zone between 1.2455-1.2489 after Thursday's drop from near 1.2500. The U.S. dollar slipped
overnight after disappointing U.S. jobless claims. If USD/SGD ends Friday below 1.2452 it will be
beneath the Ichimoku Cloud support zone and the 20-day Bollinger midsupport--making it more likely to
see further downside next week. The persistently low yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury
bond--which lingers around its 2014 trough--has been a burden on the U.S. unit this week. USD/SGD is
now 1.2464 from its Thursday close of 1.2463. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0130 GMT [Dow Jones] Expect sighs of relief in the boardrooms of Qantas (QAN.AU) and Virgin
Australia (VAH.AU) after government data pointed toward signs of stability in most domestic airfares this
month. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics indicated business class fares
in August would rise 14.7% on-year, with restricted economy fares up 4.7%. Discount fares, however, are
likely down 11.8%. "In broad terms, we expect a stabilization in mainstream airfares to be positive for
both Qantas and Virgin," says Bell Potter analyst John O'Shea. Still, that assessment comes with two key

Page61of351©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.caveats. Firstly, discount airfares appear to be still in decline, which is negative for both airlines.
Secondly, the bulk of Qantas's passenger growth over the past 18 months has been at its Jetstar budget
carrier and the data suggest airfares for this segment remain under pressure.(david.winning@wsj.com;

0122 GMT [Dow Jones] Global dairy prices continue to search for a bottom, with prices now down by
37% on the year, says ASB Bank Rural Economist Nathan Penny. He notes, however, many of the
factors pushing down prices are due to temporary boosts to supply. For example, the production rebound
from drought in New Zealand won't repeat and the NZD and dairy prices "are out of whack and we see a
rising possibility of this gap closing over the year." All up, ASB expects dairy prices to stabilize and
recover by the end of 2014. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)
0116 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities are poised for a higher open as signs of de-escalating
tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine boost demand for riskier assets. "Both Iraq and
Ukraine are showing signs of reaching equilibrium in the respective conflicts, meaning the markets are
refocusing on central banks," says IG. The data calendar includes Hong Kong's GDP for the second
quarter, while China may also release foreign direct investment data. "We expect a pick-up in their
growth rate to above-consensus levels," says Credit Agricole of the FDI data. This would be unlikely,
however, to change the picture of an economy that slowed in the first part of the summer." The Hang
Seng Index fell 0.4% to 24,801.36 yesterday, while index futures gain 0.5% ahead of the market open.

0116 GMT [Dow Jones] The market is significantly underpricing additional monetary easing from the
Bank of Japan this autumn, and that provides a good opportunity to buy USD/JPY, Morgan Stanley says.
Japan's second-quarter GDP not only contracted by 6.8% on-year, but the composition of growth strongly
suggested a weak third quarter; meanwhile, domestic inflation has also stayed weak due to
underwhelming wage growth, and core inflation could drop below 1% again, the bank explains. "All these
reasons make us believe that the BOJ could kick back into action, weakening the JPY against USD, and
we think the pair could grind higher to 106," Morgan Stanley says. The bank recommends buying
USD/JPY at 102.50 with a target of 106.00 and suggests placing a sell-stop at 101.50 to limit losses.
Spot USD/JPY is at 102.50. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

"Crown Resorts Weathering Soft Consumer Environment - Citi -- Market Talk," at 0057 GMT, misstated
the name of the brokerage issuing the report on Crown Resorts. It was Macquarie, not Citi.

0057 GMT [Dow Jones] Macquarie keeps its outperform rating and A$21.45 target on Crown Resorts
(CWN.AU) after a 10% rise in its Australian casino revenue growth in the second half. "All in, Crown's
domestic business looks to be weathering the soft consumer environment, boosted by notable VIP
contributions and Macau earnings," the broker says. "Despite difficult macro conditions and increasing
VIP competition, we view Crown's domestic assets as well placed to deliver consistent earnings growth
over the medium term. In our view, Crown remains highly levered to international growth, with earnings
from Melco Crown (MPEL) contributing approximately 82% to total EBIT in FY18, up from 52% in FY14,
per our estimates." CWN last up 0.5% at A$15.74. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

report on Crown Resorts. It was Macquarie, not Citi.

0037 GMT [Dow Jones] Spot USD/SGD is likely consolidate after hitting a one-week low of 1.2446
Thursday as market participants trim long-SGD bets ahead of the weekend. The currency pair is now in
the "neutral zone" of the 20-day Bollinger Band (an area between the one-standard-deviation lower and
upper bands) with the middle Bollinger Band now at 1.2452. A drop below 1.2446 will expose the
downside to 1.2409 (base of neutral zone). Resistance is expected at 1.2493 (high in Asian session
Thursday, near top of daily Ichimoku cloud). Spot USD/SGD was last quoted at 1.2456-61 in the
interbank market. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
0033 GMT [Dow Jones] Pressure is building on Mineral Resources Ltd. (MIN.AU) as the iron-ore price
environment weakens and competition intensifies in Australia's mining services sector, says J.P. Morgan
analyst Anthony Passe-de Silva. "MIN's mining services exposure provides strong linkages to mine
production, particularly iron ore," where output is rising sharply, he says. "But, MIN is not immune to
sector-wide cost pressures from miners while it also recovers from losing higher-margin crushing

trades down 0.2% at A$10.14. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)
