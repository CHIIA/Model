Lend Lease topped the success of its Barangaroo apartment sellout last August with all 357
apartments in the first stage of its Darling Quarter residences selling out over the weekend.
The developer signed contracts with buyers for around half a billion dollars worth of real estate that
will form a large component of its $1 billion revitalisation of the southern end of Darling Harbour.

Prices started from $700,000 for a 50-square-metre, one-bedroom apartment and rose to $3.5 million
for a 130-square-metre "sky home" – a rate of $27,000 per square metre.

The Sydney central business district has been a hot market for new apartments. In August last year
Lend Lease sold out all 159 residences in Barangaroo South generating more than $300 million in
sales. Prices were as high as $40,000 per square metre for penthouses.
Chinese developer Greenland has sold more than $415 million worth of apartments in its mixed-use
development on the former Sydney Water Boardsite following two staged releases.

Lend Lease project director Rob Deck told The Australian Financial Review the Darling Quarter
sellout reflected the competitive pricing of the apartments and the value buyers placed on its location
"right on the doorstep of Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Haymarket and Ultimo with a perfect
Walkscore of 100".
Mr Deck said 60 per cent of buyers had purchased to take advantage of the benefits of living so
close to the city and included young professionals and parents who had bought apartments for their
children. About 25 per cent of apartments were sold to offshore buyers. Construction of the 40-storey
apartment block and seven-storey "boutique" block will begin in early 2015 and be completed in
2017.
