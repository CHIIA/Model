Hoyts pictures a float with international investor roadshow

Entertainment Sarah Thompson Jake Mitchell Anthony Macdonald

Cinema chain Hoyts Group is planning an international roadshow to market a potential $900 million
initial public offering and is likely to
appoint investment banks to join UBS in running the float. It is understood the company is likely to
embark on an investor roadshow to Asia, Europe and North America in November with a view to listing
the company in December. Sources said one or two more

investment banks would likely be appointed in coming weeks, with Macquarie Group and Citigroup in
the mix. Appointments may be held back until after reporting season as ASX-listed companies wind
down at the end of the month. The decision to float Hoyts comes after private owner Pacific Equity
Partners ruled out interest from trade buyers. It is understood trade parties including Chinese
company Dalian Wanda looked at Hoyts. PEP bought Hoyts Group in December 2007 in a deal
valuing the company at $440 million. Hoyts is the region's second- largest cinema operator with about

450 screens and 44 cinema complexes, according to PEP's website. It also has a movies-to-home
offering and owns the Val Morgan cinema advertising brand. Damian Keogh was promoted to chief
executive of Hoyts in February after a successful tenure at the helm of Val Morgan.
