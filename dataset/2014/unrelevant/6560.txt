Release date - 28012014

During the three months to 31 December, 2013, Perth-based Viking Ashanti completed a number of
reviews of projects and companies which were considered complimentary to the Company’s strategic
objectives, culminating in the announcement on 20 November 2013 of a proposed merger with unlisted
Sydney based emerging coal producer, Auminco Mines Limited.

No field activity was undertaken on the Company’s Ghanaian gold projects during the period.

Auminco Merger

On 20 December 2013 and 6 December 2013, Viking Ashanti announced it had entered into a binding
Heads of Agreement with Auminco Mines Limited (AUM or Auminco) under which Viking Ashanti has
agreed to merge with Auminco in a share exchange transaction.

The agreement will see Viking Ashanti acquire 100% of the Auminco shares and options by the issue of:

81,000,000 Viking Ashanti shares;
27,000,000 million unlisted Viking Ashanti options exercisable at A$0.12 for a term of 30 months from
merger completion and

3,000,000 unlisted Viking Ashanti options exercisable at A$0.20 on or before 15 November 2016.

As a result of the consideration Viking Ashanti shareholders will own 53% and Auminco shareholders
47% of the enlarged post-merger capital on an undiluted basis and prior to any capital raising.
A further capital raising is planned for the consolidated Company early in 2014 to fund operations, with
the minimum expected to complete internal production feasibility studies and to make development
decisions.

The indicative timetable for completion of the merger, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, is
March 2014.

The proposed post-merger Board will comprise four members with existing Viking Ashanti Directors, Mr
Jack Gardner and Mr Peter McMickan remaining as Chairman and Executive Director respectively.
Auminco’s Mr Andrew Whitten will join the Board as Non-Executive Deputy Chairman while Mr Matt
Morgan will become Managing Director. Mr Bayar Tsagdaa will act as an alternate for Mr Andrew Whitten.

Merger Highlights
Auminco is a Sydney based emerging coal producer with two high quality strategically located coal
projects in Mongolia.
There is near term production potential from the Berkh Uul bituminous coal project, located near the
Russian border, rail infrastructure and potential off-take customers.
The Khonkhor Zag anthracitic coal project is located on a granted 30 year mining lease close to China’s
border with only 1.2 km of the 4 km strike explored by drilling.

projects in Mongolia and Australia.

Auminco was founded by the founding shareholders and former management of Coalworks Limited (ASX:
CWK) which was taken over by Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX: WHC) for approx. $200 million in June
2012. Auminco is more than 50% owned by ex-Coalworks management and advisers.
The Viking Ashanti Board believes that the consolidated company will provide improved shareholder
value to both

Viking Ashanti and Auminco through:
addition of a portfolio of highly prospective coal projects, particularly the Berkh Uul bituminous coal
project, that provide the opportunity for short term project development, mining and cash flow;

diversity across two country jurisdictions and multiple commodities, allowing for exploration activity and
potential news flow on a year round basis;

improved access to funding;

strengthened share register;

greater market liquidity, and a

broad range of complementary skill sets at Board and management level.
On completion, this will be a transforming transaction for Viking Ashanti allowing the Company to achieve
its strategic objective of acquiring near term production assets with potential to deliver sustainable cash
flows for in excess of 15 years with substantial exploration upside.
Berkh Uul Coal Project - Mongolia (AUM 100%)
Berkh Uul is located 400 km north of Ulaanbaatar in northern Mongolia within the Orkhon-Selege coal
district and within 20km of the Russian border. The project is within 40km of rail access into Russian
off-take markets, in close proximity to water, infrastructure and transport.
The exploration permit is valid to 2015, with a Mining Lease application imminent.
The deposit consists of shallow, consistent coal seams of high quality bituminous coal amenable to low
strip ratio open pit mining, with expected low capital and operating costs.
There is local industrial demand for Berkh Uul coal; the unwashed product is favoured for its low ash and
relatively high calorific value. It is expected that Berkh Uul will move to production within 12 - 18 months.
Khonkhor Zag Coal project - Mongolia (AUM 100%)
Khonkor Zag is an anthracitic coal project located 1,400 km southwest of Ulaanbaatar in Western
Mongolia. It is strategically located within 40km of China’s Burgastai border port with an existing haul
road adjoining the tenement.
The current mining licence was granted in April 2013 for a period of 30 years. A total of 42 drill holes over
1.2 strike km have been completed on the tenement, with further drilling planned to increase the deposit
size for a JORC resource estimate. This drilling, combined with historical mining on the outcropping coal
seams, indicates clear potential for open pit mining. Excellent scope exists to develop a low cost, high
margin premium coal project close to Chinese markets.

Exploration
Akoase Gold Project - Ghana (VKA 100%)
No field activity was undertaken in the quarter. The Company continues to examine options for
progressing the 790,000 oz Akoase East gold deposit.
West Star/Blue River Joint Venture Gold Project - Ghana (VKA 100% hard rock gold rights) No field
activity was undertaken in the quarter.
The West Star and Blue River gold properties are subject to joint venture agreements with local
Ghanaian companies, where Viking Ashanti has earned 100% of the rights to all hard rock gold
mineralization.

A number of Ghanaian located project farm-in and farm-out opportunities were considered during the
quarter. None are currently at an advanced stage of consideration. Viking Ashanti will continue to pursue
these and any other opportunities, which are complementary to its existing Ghanaian project portfolio.
On 20 December 2013 the Company announced that it had placed 22,537,645 ordinary shares at
A$0.035 each to professional and sophisticated investors. The placement issue was made in accordance
with the Company’s placement capacity under ASX Listing Rules 7.1 & 7.1A, and closed oversubscribed,
which at the issue price equated to a maximum equity raise of A$788,818, before costs.
After this issue the total issued capital of the Company is 112,688,225 ordinary shares and 22,683,913
options exercisable at A$0.18 on or before 31 August 2014. The proceeds from the placement will be
used to fund transaction costs associated with the proposed Auminco merger and for general working
capital purposes. Cash and credit facility reserves at 31 December 2013 were $898,000.
