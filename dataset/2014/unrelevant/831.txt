Consmin, a leading manganese ore producer with mining operations in Australia and Ghana,
announces its quarterly results for the period ended 31 March 2014.

TD

Key highlights
Manganese ore production for Q1 2014 was 4% higher than in Q1 2013. Australian manganese ore
production remained the same and Ghana manganese ore production increased 7% compared to Q1
2013.

Manganese C1 cash costs improved from $2.62/dmtu in Q1 2013 to $2.29/dmtu in Q1 2014 continuing
the downward trend seen over the last three years. The reduction in C1 cash costs is due to the phasing
of the mine plan, cost reductions in haulage and shiploading, and foreign exchange benefits from the
relative weakening of the Australian dollar.

Manganese sales tonnes decreased 16% in Q1 2014 due to adverse weather conditions in Australia
delaying haulage, and as a consequence, shipments. In Ghana there were shipping capacity restrictions
as a result of the transition to the transhipment arrangements that successfully took place during the
quarter. The Company expects these volume shortfalls to be fully caught up during the remainder of the
year.

Average manganese FOB sales price achieved decreased 4.8% from $4.84 in Q1 2013 to $4.61 in Q1
2014.
Average manganese ore price for Q1 2014 (CRU, 44%Mn CIF China) was $5.08/dmtu, down 3% from
$5.25/dmtu in Q4 2013. The Company’s average price for its Australian 46%Mn lump product, CIF China,
was $5.67/dmtu in Q1 2014, up 1% from $5.60/dmtu in Q4 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2014 was $48 million, a decrease of $5 million compared to Q1 2013.
The Group recorded a profit for the period of $24 million, on par with profit in Q1 2013.
During the quarter the Company generated positive operating cashflow of $31 million. Cash and cash
equivalents increased during the quarter by $9 million to $229 million with net debt falling in the quarter
from $23 million at 31 December 2013 to $3 million on 31 March 2014.
During the quarter the Company spent $10 million on the repurchase of its bonds. On 1 May 2014 the
Company redeemed $112.5 million of the outstanding $225.0 million notes outstanding. On 12 May
2014, the Company issued $400 million in principal amount of 8.0% senior secured notes due 2020. A
part of the net proceeds of the issue will be used to repurchase the remaining $112.5 million of 8.875%
senior secured notes due 2016.
In July 2013 the Company ceased mining at its Coobina chromite mine and final sales of chromite ore
concluded in Q1 2014. Coobina has been reclassified as a discontinued operation in the statement of
comprehensive income for Q1 2014 and Q1 2013.

delivered solid operational and financial performance with EBITDA of $48 million and a profit after tax of
$24 million.

Manganese sales tonnes decreased 16% in Q1 2014 due to the combination of adverse weather
conditions in Australia and the transition to the transhipper arrangements in Ghana that were successfully
completed in February 2014.
Volumes of manganese ore produced were 3.5% higher as a result of strong operational performance in
Australia and Ghana with manganese C1 cash costs continuing to reduce to $2.29 per dmtu as a result of
phasing of the mine plan, further cost reductions in haulage and shiploading and foreign exchange
benefits from the relative weakening of the Australian dollar.’
