Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday, as a weaker yen pushed Japan higher, while Australia and
South Korea fell in early trade.

The region was little moved ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement, which will come out later
today. The U.S. central bank is expected to announce another $10 billion reduction in its bond-buying
program to $35 billion a month.

The Nikkei rose for the second consecutive day, last up 0.3%, amid yen weakness. The dollar rose
0.3% overnight to cross the Yen102 mark, and was steady during Asian trade at Yen102.13.

In Australia, the S&P ASX 200 lost 0.1% as resource companies continued to stoke investor concern.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. fell 3.7% in Sydney after the oil company restarted trading following Royal
Dutch Shell PLC's sale of a 9.5% stake in the firm to institutional investors. That move weighed on
the broader market on Tuesday, as investors sold shares in other companies to take part in the deal.
Also in Sydney, energy-minerals firmAquila Resources Ltd. surged 7% after the company
recommended to shareholders that it accept a takeover deal from China's Baosteel Group Corp. and
Aurizon Holdings Ltd.

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi was down 0.4%.
