A seven-session winning streak on the sharemarket ended with a modest dip on Friday, despite an
afternoon rally. However, the market still posted its second consecutive week of gains.
Some better-than-expected factory data out of China and guidance-beating quarterly production
reports boosted mining stocks, despite a drop in the price of iron ore.

The S&P/ASX 200 index added 0.9 per cent over the week to close at 5583.5 points. The broader All
Ordinaries Index gained 1 per cent to 5574.2 points; it is flirting with the 5600-point level for the first
time since June 2008.
Shares finished 0.1 per cent lower on Friday after the spot price of iron ore slid for the seventh
straight day to $US93.60 per tonne.

"Aussie shares have had a good July, up 3.6 per cent month-to-date and that has really been driven
by a rally in the mining sector, which is up about 8.8 per cent month-to-date," Peter Sumner, a
portfolio manager at MLC Investments, said.
"The mining sector had retreated about 3 per cent over the June quarter," he said. "This bounce
comes as concerns about declining demand growth for iron ore and coal from China abides, while
the local producers have delivered some pleasing production updates over the past fortnight."
On Thursday, the HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers index showed Chinese factory activity
at an 18-month high.

BHP Billiton rose 1.6 per cent to $39 over the week. On Wednesday, it upgraded its production
guidance for the current financial year after showing it beat 2013-14 targets. Rio Tinto rose 1.2 per
cent to $65.09.
Australia's biggest goldminer, Newcrest Mining, fell 7.1 per cent to $10.70 over a week in which it
signalled a write-down of up to $2.5 billion after tax, and a shareholder class action was formally
commenced over its handling of continuous disclosure obligations last year. The spot price of gold
retreated over the week to $US1292.40 per ounce.

Woodside Petroleum rose 1.2 per cent to $42.70. It spent much of the week drumming up support for
its proposed buyback of the remaining Royal Dutch Shell shareholding. Brent crude oil remained
steady above $US107 a barrel during the week.

Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank each added 1.2 per cent to $82.28,
$34.28 and $34.59 respectively. ANZ rose 1 per cent to $33.75

Telstra gained 0.4 per cent at $5.45 after announcing plans to move nearly 700 jobs to Asia.

Food and liquor was the worst-performing sector over the week, down 0.2 per cent, as Wesfarmers,
owner of Coles, fell 0.4 per cent to $43.28, and Woolworths edged up 0.1 per cent to $36.

cent to $12.93 following news of an $86.3 million British acquisition.

Rare earths miner Lynas Corp was the best-performing stock, rising 27.6 per cent over the five
sessions to 18.5¢ as US rival MolyCorp contends with activist shareholders following the
downgrading of its debt to junk status.

"If MolyCorp went under then that would take a significant supplier out of the market and may benefit
Lynas Corp in the longer term," Patersons Securities head of research Rob Brierley said.

Junior goldminer Beadell Resources was the worst-performer, down 11.4 per cent to 54.5¢. "Beadell
downgraded full-year production guidance for FY14 by 10 per cent on Thursday after June quarter
output missed guidance," Canaccord Genuity analyst Luke Smith said.
