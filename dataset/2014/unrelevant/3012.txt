Commercial property buyers splurge $10 billion
Property Carolyn Cummins

Takeovers, changes to investment regulations and demand for high- yielding, "safe-haven" bricks and
mortar assets attracted close to $10billion cash to the Australian commercial real estate sector in the
past few months, according to new data. This trend is tipped to continue, boosted by Asian-based
insurance companies with access to more

than $7trillion, thanks to a liberalisation of investment regulations. The buying has been in direct assets
across office towers, shopping malls and hotels, as well as indirectly through real estate investment
trusts, which offer a "safe haven", pseudo-bond market stability in a low interest rate environment.The
REITs head into the 2014 reporting season next month with an average return tipped about 10per cent
on a total return basis.
Recent asset sales include, in Sydney, the Sofitel Wentworth Hotel in Phillip Street and the Ausgrid site
at 570 George Street, which were snapped up by Singaporean investors, while US companyBlackstone
bought a half- share of the Westpac headquarters at 275 Kent Street - with an accompanying deal to
buy other Mirvac properties valued at $824million. In Melbourne, Chinese and Hong Kong investors
bought into the hotel market with the boutique
Ovolo and Park Hyatt. Some recent sales have come from China and Singapore, and expectations are
that the inflow will continue to be strong for a range of properties, with a focus on city-based offices that
can be converted to apartments.In its second-quarter, 2014 report, DTZ Australia said total investment
volume was recorded at $9.3billion - up 93per cent quarter-on-quarter. It said the main reason for this
was the significant merger and acquisition activity that occurred in the second quarter.

At the halfway point through 2014, investment volume stands at $14 billion, almost 30 per cent higher
than the first half 2013 at $11 billion. According to CBRE research of the insurance regulators in 10
Asian jurisdictions, total insurance assets reached $US6.7 trillion in Asia at the end of 2013, compared
with $US5.8trillion in the US and $US3trillion in the UK.
