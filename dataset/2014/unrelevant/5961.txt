Profit taking in Japan after its return to trade for the first time in the New Year (after closing 2013 with a
six-year high with a 57% annual gain, its biggest in more than 40 years, Reuters reported), and further
signs that China's growth is moderating, with the HSBC/Markit Services PMI for December coming in at
50.9 in December from 52.5 in November with new business expansion the slowest in six months led to
profit taking across Asia, including our market.

Meanwhile Bloomberg reported Australia's century old auto industry including about 150 suppliers that
employ an estimated 42,000 people, is bracing for extinction as the strong local currency and lower tariffs
drive out manufacturers. Sales of Australian made cars have fallen 41% since 2006, Bloomberg reported,
with last year's decline the biggest since 2006.
*M/v trader AHG Ltd rose 9c to $3.92 on 505,460 shares - have also been takeover rumors.

*Northern Star rose 5c to 89c on 3.3m shares in a strong performance among the golds after its takeover
of Barrick Gold's Aussie interests.

*Isonea rose 7.5c to 42.5c on 1.4m shares as the market approved management changes.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures fell 330 points to 15,960 points, Shanghai CSI physical fell 40.13
