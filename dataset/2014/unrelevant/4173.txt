Aussie 10 year bond yields are steady at 4.12%. The $A is up about 10 points from early levels to

*The banks have contributed 6 positive points to the index, insurers have contributed 1.9 positive points,
resources have contributed 5.4 positive points, property trusts have contributed 0.7 positive points,
retailers have contributed 1 positive point and Telstra has contributed 1 positive point.

The Nikkei Dow futures is up 170 points to 14,300 points, Shanghai CSI physical is down 5.66 points to
1987.82, Hang Seng futures is up 60 points to 21,210 points. S^P futures is down 1.1 points to 1865
points, Nasdaq futures is down 1 point to 3690.5 points, Dow futures are down 7 points to 16,258 points.

A bit of a relief rally after yesterday's 60 point fall has lifted assorted stocks, but the market overall is very
quiet with investors sitting on their hands ahead of the weekend.

"For the day I'll call us up 10 points'.

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "I'll start with the S&P500. Again there was good support
around the 1855 level last night, which held. The S&P also tested the 20 day moving average which held.
It has closed above that level for 3 days in a row in a similar range with quite big volatility. This has often
been a catalyst for a pullback, worth keeping an eye on. Meanwhile the S&P tested 1874 for the last three
nights as a resistance point. The break and close above there on the week is short term bullish. A failure
to close above it tonight could see some short term bearish pressure - keep an eye on the close for the
week.
*Copper was down 5% last night, very close to the $2.90/lb support level. We really need to see $2.90
hold for the week. If not it is very bearish for copper. On the 5 year weekly chart copper has been in
downtrend since back in 2011. Keep an eye on the $2.90/lb price on Comex. A break would look quite
ugly.

*Shanghai had quite a volatile day. It broke and closed below the key 2000 level we have talked about,
that it has tested several times in the last couple of weeks. The break and close below 2000 was pretty
bearish. A break and close below 2000 today would confirm the bearish trend after being short term
bearish yesterday.

*The XJO had a lot of selling pressure yesterday, probably indicating some overseas selling, and pretty
much closed on its lows. Given we broke levels of support yesterday, on the daily chart there is probably
no real support now until 5260. A break of 5260 would threaten a head back towards 5190.

Page202of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."For the week, the bulls will want to see the close at or above 5315 today. Resistance is at 5300 and then
5315. Anywhere above 5315 and we're looking for 5330 for the next resistance.

"For the day I'll call us up about 10 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 61.6 points to 5294 last evening.

Metcash announced in an update to its 2014 full year guidance, details of its strategic review to address
structural challenges within the business will be presented to the market on March 21.

Aspects of this plan are being implemented and have begun to impact current year's earnings. January
and February results were also below management forecasts. Management now expects a decline in

Grocery pillar.

retail sales primarily been in fresh departments and direct sales and items not stocked in the group's
warehouses.

The carrying value of certain retail and other assets are being impaired, together expected to total $30/35
million pre tax, predominantly non cash in nature. (Mar 20)
