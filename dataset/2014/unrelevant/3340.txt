Toowoomba Elders

NUMBERS dropped by 320 to hit 828 this week.

The smaller yarding was very mixed in quality. A fair panel of buyers was present and operating on the
young cattle and one exporter was absent in the cow section.

Medium and heavyweight yearling steers to feed improved in price by 4–5c/kg. However lightweight
yearling heifers to feed and slaughter could not maintain the previous week’s prices.
The small sample of heavy grown steers and bullocks generally sold to strong competition. Cows
experienced a mixed trend, with buyers very selective on the medium-weight plain-condition lines,
however good heavy cows maintained a strong trend.

Calves to slaughter averaged 164c and made to 181.2c/kg. Vealer heifers averaged 174c and made to
189.2c/kg. Lightweight yearling steers to feed or backgrounders sold to 213.2c, to average 189c/kg.
Medium-weight yearling steers to feed averaged 196c, with some to 211.2c, while heavyweights
generally sold around 205c, with some to 208.2c/kg.
Lightweight yearling heifers to feed and slaughter mostly sold in the mid-160c/kg range, with
poor-quality lines around 148c/kg. Medium-weight yearling heifers to the trade made to 188.2c, to
average 181c/kg. Heavyweights made to the occasional 203.2c, with a fair sample at 185c/kg.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks averaged 206c and 207c respectively, with both reaching to
211.2c/kg. Medium-weight two-score cows averaged 139c and made to 154.2c/kg. Good heavy cows
averaged close to 180c and made to 189.2c/kg. Heavy bulls reached 210.2c/kg.

Toowoomba Landmark

NUMBERS dropped by 225 to hit 535 this week.

Numbers reduced by 30% from last week’s yarding, with quality also lower. Competition was solid for
most descriptions, despite the absence of one export buyer, with plain-conditioned cows the most
affected. However heavy finished cows sold to a solid market.

Light yearling steers to feed averaged 193c, with a top price of 207c/kg. Medium yearling steers to the
paddock sold to 215c, while feeders in the same range averaged 195c/kg. Heavy feeder steers sold
to average of 198.5c/kg. Light yearling heifers to feed to averaged 170c, with medium and heavy feed
on heifers selling at 180c/kg.
Heavy grown steers to slaughter sold to 212.8c and averaged 207c/kg. Heavy four-score cows to
slaughter topped at 188c and averaged around 177c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 200c, with an average of
193c/kg.

A smaller yarding of very mixed cattle came forward. There were a few good pens of heavy steers and
only limited numbers of cows this week. A good sample of feeder steers were on offer, while a mixed
yarding of vealers was about.

Export classes held with last week’s improved rates while some plainer and lighter vealers/trade were
a little easier. Regular buyers in attendance, with good support from feedlot operators and restockers.
Charolais-cross steers 629kg from Vale View sold for 212.8c for $1339, also selling 595kg angus
steers for $1256.

and angus steers 685kg sold for 196.2c for $1343.

Warwick cattle

NUMBERS dropped by 184 to hit 1401 in Warwick.

There was a small decline in supply and overall quality was fair to good, however there was a wide
variation in the standard of the lightweight classes. Buyers were very selective on the lightweight
descriptions and those falling outside feeder specifications experienced a subdued market. Feeder
operators maintained the buying strength of previous weeks, with both medium and heavyweight
yearling steers in demand and local butchers were also very active when the opportunity arose.

A full panel of export buyers returned to the market and lifted prices on bullocks by six cents and
medium-weight cows averaged 4–5c/kg better and more in places.
Calves to restockers mostly sold around 162c, with some to 182.2c/kg. Well-bred vealer steers
returned to the paddock at a top of 226.2c to average 191c/kg. Butchers battled to secure the short
supply of suitable vealer heifers and paid to 216.2c/kg.

Medium-weight yearling steers to feed averaged in the high 190c/kg range and made to 210c/kg. The
largest number of heavyweights to feed averaged 203c and made to 210c, while local trade
descriptions reached 218.2c, to average 210c/kg.
Lightweight yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend to average 163c, with some to 179.2c/kg. Medium
weights to the trade made to 210.2c, to average 183c/kg. Heavy grown steers and bullocks averaged
210c and 212c respectively, with both classes reaching 217.2c/kg. Medium-weight two-score cows
averaged four cents dearer, at 146c, and sold to 161.2c/kg. Good heavy cows mostly sold around
183c, some to 194.2c/kg. Heavy bulls reached 224.2c/kg.

Dalby cattle

September 17 report:

NUMBERS dropped by 429 to hit 5831 last week.

Numbers only reduced by a few hundred head and overall quality was fair to good, with some large
runs of feeder cattle and cows. Buyer attendance was good, with representatives covering all classes.
Young cattle experienced a mixed trend, with lightweight lines of yearling steers and heifers losing
ground in price by 9–11c/kg. However very strong feeder activity lifted prices of medium and
heavyweights by 7–14c/kg.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks received strong competition and improved in price by 2–3c/kg. The
very large line-up of cows varied in price, with medium-weight plain-condition lines maintaining a firm
trend, however good heavy cows averaged 6c/kg cheaper.

Calves to restockers made to 186.2c to average 169c/kg. Lightweight yearling steers to feed averaged
nine cents cheaper at 186c, with sales to 212.2c/kg. A large consignment returned to the paddock at
192c and sold to 211.2c/kg. Medium weights to feed reached 217.2c with the plain-condition lines
averaging 205c, while the better classes averaged close to 212c/kg. Heavy feeders were dearer, with
some large runs reaching 222.2c and most around 216c, some returning $1124/head.

Page40of221©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The largest number of lightweight yearling heifers averaged 11 cents less at 165c, with only a few
reaching 200c/kg. Medium- weight yearling heifers to feed averaged 185c and a fair selection sold to
the trade 8c dearer at 182c/kg.
Heavy grown steers averaged 204c and made to 214.2c, while the bullock portion sold to a top 218.2c
to average 206c/kg. Medium- weight two-score cows averaged 142c and made to 158.2c/kg. Good
heavy cows were in the largest numbers and made to 189.2c, to average 179c/kg. Heavy bulls lost
seven cents to average 188c, some to 209.2c/kg.

Roma Prime

September 18 report:

NUMBERS dropped by 361 to total 1542 last week.

Good numbers were penned, with cattle drawn from most western parts of Queensland. All the usual
export processors were operating and good-quality bullocks and grown heifers continued to attract
very solid processor buyer competition.

The three and four-score cow price came off the boil, with good heavy four-score cows reaching
184c/kg. The better-quality bulls met strong export processor demand but secondary lines were
cheaper than the previous prime sale. Medium-weight grown steers sold to 213c and averaged 209c,
up nine cents, while bullocks hit 210c and averaged 205c, up 6c/kg.
Medium-weight three-score grown heifers sold to 156c and averaged 149c, down five cents, and
