The Platts Australian alumina assessment was rangebound at $335/mt FOB on January 22, as market
participants stayed on the sidelines waiting for further market direction.
With the majority of smelters in Asia and the Middle East stocked up for the next few months, Chinese
consumers and Western traders have been the main prospective alumina buyers for Australian
material.

But the Chinese consumers are now standing back ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays,
and traders looking to place their cargoes in China are also retreating to the sidelines.
"The market is slowing down," a Western trader said. A Chinese trader expressed a similar sentiment.
"There aren't many buyers in the market right now; the Chinese end users aren't keen to buy," the
trader said.
China's financial markets will be closed for Lunar New Year celebrations from January 31 to February
6.
Market participants also said there was no shortage of Australian alumina in the coming months. A
Chinese consumer-turned-trader said an Asian consumer may be looking to resell a cargo. Another
source said he received two separate offers in the past week: one was for a prompt cargo; the other to
swap a second-half 2014 cargo. "I doubt anyone would have have any difficulty getting a March cargo,"
he added.
BHP Billiton produced 2.6 million mt of alumina in the second half of 2013, up 8% compared with the
same period in 2012, the company said in its production report released on January 23 (see seperate
story).Alumina production for the October-December quarter stood at 1.4 million mt, up 10% year on
year, and up 8% from the previous quarter.
India's Nalco issued a tender for the sale of a 30,000 mt alumina cargo for February 17-21 shipment
from Vishakhapatnam, industry sources said late on January 21. The closing date for fixed-price FOB
Vishakhapatnam bids is January 28 with validity until January 29, they said.
The Platts daily Handysize alumina freight assessment from Western Australia to northeast China was
unchanged on January 22 at $24.50/mt, basis 30,000 mt cargoes for February-March loadings.
The Platts daily China alumina assessment for Henan province was stable on January 22 at Yuan
2,520/mt ($413) ex-works for 70:30 cash and credit terms, in quiet spot activity.
According to the latest figures from the ChinaGeneral Administration of Customs, China's bauxite
imports for calendar year 2013 were 71.6 million mt, up 78.7% from 2012 (see separate story).
Imports rose in 2013 as Chinese buyers stockpiled ahead of the Indonesian mineral ores export ban,
which came into effect on January 12, 2014. Indonesia was China's top supplier of imported bauxite
before the ban, accounting for about 70% of China's total 2013 bauxite imports. In 2013, China's

million mt imported in 2012.
