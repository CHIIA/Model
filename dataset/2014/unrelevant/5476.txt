Japan's Inpex has yet to secure financing for phase two of its 8.4 million mt/year Ichthys LNG
liquefaction facility in Australia, project Managing Director Louis Bon said.

The project, which is on schedule to load its first cargo by December 30, 2016, remains within its $34
billion budget, representing the largest ever Japanese overseas investment, Bon added.

However, financing will only cover the first phase of the Darwin-based project, which will see 20 wells
spudded out of a total of 50.

The Ichthys field is estimated to contain more than 12 Tcf of gas, providing reserves to the two-train 8.4
million mt/year project for at least 40 years.

The Brewster reservoir -- with the highest condensate content -- will supply the first phase of the project,
while the Plover reservoir will supply phase two, Bon said.

No cost or timeframe estimate have been given for the financing of the second phase as yet, as
long-term LNG buyers will need to be secured.

"The LNG in the first 15 years -- the proven reserves -- is already sold, mostly to Japanese buyers.
There are also two oil companies and one Chinese buyer," Bon said.
The facility will supply a total of 8.23 million mt/year to seven Japanese buyers including stakeholders
Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Chubu Electric and Toho Gas, as well as Taiwan's CPC, Inpex and Total for 15
years.
Spot sales from the facility have not been ruled out, according to a company executive, but there has
been no definitive volume allotment that could be made available from the facility to the spot market.

Although it has already secured two vessels, Inpex will likely need to secure a third for the transportation
of its LNG.

WORKS REACHING ADVANCED STAGE

Works at the facility -- which is located in Bladin Point, outside Darwin

moved into an advanced stage this week, with 50% of construction now complete and plans to start
laying 889 km (550 miles) of gas export pipeline due to get under way in July.

Dredging of Darwin harbor is close to completion.

The second train will be completed first, with works on train one continuing after the project reaches first
gas, according to a company executive.

The first of more than 200 modules is scheduled to arrive later this month, while the first 160,000 cubic
meter cryogenic tank is near completion and construction has begun on a second.

were tight-lipped over the prospects of adding further capacity beyond the current infrastructure. The
facility has space to house up to six LNG trains and at least one more storage tank.
Operator Inpex holds a 63.445% stake in Ichthys LNG, along with France's Total with 30%. Japanese
LNG customers Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Chubu Electric and Toho Gas hold stakes of 1.575%, 1.2%,
0.735% and 0.42%, respectively, and Taiwan's CPC is set to take a 2.625% interest.
