MINING: The collapse in uranium prices is having a telling impact on Paladin’s revenue stream from
its African operations.

And with the Perth-based group having already flagged the mothballing of one of the mines, more
pain is on the way.

Paladin’s March quarter production report, released yesterday, disclosed that despite an increase in
the volume of uranium sold, revenue fell by 16 per cent from $US106 million in the previous
corresponding period to $US88.56m ($94.57m).
The group’s received price for uranium tumbled from $US55.22 a pound previously to $US36.82 a
pound, with the latter price just above the spot price average for the quarter of $US35.15 a pound.
Prices have since weakened to $US33 a pound. But Paladin’s resident bull on uranium prices —
chief executive John Borshoff — believes prices are bottoming out.
He pointed to Canada’s Uranium Participation Corporation — a listed company that buys uranium
as an investment — securing financing to make more purchases, and reports that it recently bought
850,000 pounds of the material for near-term delivery.

Mr Borshoff said the contract or term contracting market, which involves higher prices than the spot
market, had also “begun to show activity”. He said a large US nuclear utility had requested offers for
deliveries spanning 2016-22.

Mr Borshoff said Paladin’s view was that increasing term contracting will strengthen the term price.
The company nevertheless confirmed its Kayelekera mine in Malawi would stop processing
stockpiled ore next month. There was no mine production there in the March quarter. The shutdown
was a response to weakness in the uranium price and leaves Paladin as a producer from its Langer
Heinrich mine in Namibia.
But its uranium production from that operation also gets hit once the January deal under which a
Chinese nuclear power utility is to acquire a 25 per cent stake for $US190m takes effect.

An initial $US20m payment has been received, with completion expected in June. Because production
from stockpiled ore at Kayelekera continued in the March quarter, group production for the period at
2.08 million pounds was down modestly on the preceding December quarter.Paladin shares closed
0.5c lower at 45.5c yesterday. It was a $5 stock before the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011.
