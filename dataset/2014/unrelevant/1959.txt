Australian gas firm WestSide Corp rejected as undervalued a takeover offer from China’s diversified
energy company Landbridge Group Co Ltd that valued the company at A$177.6 million ($164.52
million).Landbridge, based in Shandong, China, launched the bid for the Queensland-based coal seam
gas company to gain entry into northern Australia’s fast-growing gas industry. It currently owns a 3.2 per
cent stake in WestSide. WestSide said the proposal, which has already been increased to A$0.40 per
share a week ago from A$0.36, did not represent fair value as it did not take into account recently
announced gas sale deal with a consortium including Santos, Total and Korea Gas Corp (Kogas). The
gas sale agreement could generate over A$110 million in annual revenue to WestSide at the maximum
production rate, the company added.

It recommended shareholders reject the Landbridge offer.WestSide owns the Meridien CSG field in
Queensland state, where three large liquified natural gas (LNG) projects are being built and are due to
begin operating over the next two years.
