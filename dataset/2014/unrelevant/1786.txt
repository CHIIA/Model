EG Funds Management, the specialist operation headed by Michael Easson, has sold a
residential development site in Sydney's Macquarie Park to a Chinese fund manager for
$25.177 million.
The sale shows just how strongly the prices for apartment site projects have rebounded in recent
years.

The agent who handled the sale, Colliers International's NSW development director, Guillaume
Volz, said the sale showed a 45 per cent rise in land value in a year.
The 13,900 square metre-site is at 5 Whiteside Street, 1.5 kilometres from Macquare Park
Railway Station and Macquarie University.

It was approved last year, under the remnants of the former government's controversial Part 3A
process, for 135 apartments in buildings of two to five stories.
The sale equates to $1733 a square metre of approved gross floor area.
Mr Volz said a similar site, on the corner of Allengrove Crescent and Lane Cove Road sold a year
ago at a price equivalent to $1195 a square metre of gross floor area.
EG bought the Whiteside property in 2006 for $6.5 million and added the extra value through the
rezoning.
The group specialises in properties with potential for land-use change or repositioning through
active asset management.

It looks after six value-add funds and assets under management, when fully invested, of
$700 million.
