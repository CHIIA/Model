Our market lifted into the positive around 2.30 pm today, including a 4 point spurt on matchout, on low
volume worth $3.2 billion.

Markets across Asia did little, awaiting US job numbers and indications on whether tightening/or further
loosening will be the next move.

What is apparent is that the recovery in the US, as well as in the Euro region is tepid at best while stocks
in both regions are fully priced since interest rates are practically non existent - as also in Japan.

"Ceiling 5435. Floor 5390. Close at 5400, down 9.9 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract down 1 point. This week has been rather difficult to forecast given the slow grind
up that we have seen.

"This slow grind in addition to a number of other bearish tells is entirely consistent with a decline back to at
least 5250 before the final run up.

"But it is also consistent with a move to a new rally first, probably 5550, which would be the
penultimate/final high.

"I have been basing my forecasts on the former scenario playing out, and I will do the same today but in all
honesty it is probably now a line ball decision so I will hedge my bets with the high.

"The ceiling will be 5435. The floor will be 5390. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5400, down 9.9 points.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS

Page32of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*AHE: SPP at $3.49 to be launched, capped at $10 mln
Automotive Holdings Group Ltd announced it will shortly launch a share purchase plan offering eligible

The amount to be raised is capped at $10 million.

Market Cap $1.1b.

*CDI: Sells 187 Todd Road Port Melb for $26.25 mln in line with book
Challenger Diversified Property Group announced the sale of 187 Todd Road Port Melbourne for $26.25
million to the Podco investment syndicate. Todd Road is co-owned by CDI (0%) and Challenger Life
Company (40%). Following the payment of incentives and selling costs, net proceeds are in line with the
December 31 2013 independent valuation. Net proceeds will be used initially to repay debt and CDI will
look to reinvest the proceeds into further enhancing portfolio opportunities. The sale has no impact on
2014 earnings or distribution guidance.

Market Cap $555m.

CDI up 4 cents to $2.59
*CSR/BLD: To combine brick operations in NSW, Vic, Qld, SA, Tas, ACT
CSR Ltd and Boral Ltd announced they propose to form a j/v to combine their brick operations located on
the east coast of Australia including operations in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania
and the ACT.
CSR and Boral will approach the ACCC to seek clearance for the transaction.

The proposed j/v will be owned 60% by CSR and 40% by Boral to reflect the relative valuation of the two
businesses. No cash consideration is proposed.

Brick demand in Australia has experienced a sustained structural decline with bricks becoming an
increasingly smaller component of the broader cladding market. Lower brick demand has resulted in
declining capacity utilisation, reduced profitability, plant curtailments and closures.
Combined revenue in the order of $230 million, initial overhead savings of $7/10 million per annum
following the formation of the j/v and integration of the businesses. Longer term, the consolidation of
selected manufacturing sites will lower unit costs of production and enable both companies to develop
selected high value land assets without impacting product range and operational capability. It also
positions the business to deliver returns that recover the cost of capital through building cycles.

The companies said a change in the dwelling mix away from detached houses, traditionally more brick
intensive towards multi residential units, the virtual elimination of double brick construction from detached
houses on the east coast for frame and cladding systems with single brick veneer, emerging trends in
external facades to alternative cladding materials have reduced brick demand and impacted the brick
industry as a whole.

Cost synergies and the ability to develop certain sites over time without forgoing a similar product range or
operational capability is expected longer term.

Market Cap $1.82b. / $4.48b.

CSR up 3 cents to $3.60 / BLD up 3 cents to $5.72

*FSF: Fonterra Australia and Wooworths proposed partnership
Fonterra in its April 2014 Global Dairy Update said New Zealand milk volumes were up 6.3% for the
season to March 31 to 1.416 mln tonnes.
In its business update Fonterra included the Australia and Woolworths proposed partnership, investing in
Indonesia consumer and food service, instituting guaranteed milk price as a tool to manage volatility.

Fonterra Australia and Woolworths proposed partnership

Page33of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Fonterra Australia announced it has been selected by Woolworths as their preferred supplier to process
Woolworths Own Brand milk in Victoria for ten years. This will be confirmed once all contractual
arrangements have been finalised.
This means that all Woolworths Own Brand milk sold in Victoria will now be made and processed in
Victoria, supporting local farmers and jobs in regional communities.
Over $A30 million will be invested in a state of the art milk processing plant at FSF's Cobden site in
South West Victoria that will help deliver on its strategy of providing healthy, nutritious dairy foods in every
dairy category to Australians. It complements FSF's Riverina fresh milk business in NSW.
FSF said Australia is its second largest milk pool outside of New Zealand so it takes a long term view and
aims to deliver profitability, growth and sustainability for all its Australian dairy businesses.
Contractual arrangements are being finalised with a view to commissioning the milk processing plant at
the Cobden site in early 2015.

Investing in Indonesia Consumer and Food Service
Construction has started on FSF's blending and packing plant in Indonesia. The $NZ36 million plant will
be completed by March 2015. It will have the capacity to pack and blend 12,000 tonnes of advanced and
base nutrition milk powder products annually, equivalent to 87,000 packs of Anlene, Anmum and Anchor
Boneeto every day. Volume growth in ASEAN was up 9% in the half year 2014, with Indonesia being a key
growth region. Demand for dairy in Indonesia is expected to grow by 5% each year to 2020 and this
investment will allow Fonterra to meet local expansion of consumer brands.
Global dairy overview
Fonterra's assessment of published industry statistics indicates that global trade in dairy ingredients has
grown more than 7% per annum since the financial crisis in 2008/09, reaching 13.9 million Mt in 2013.
Growth slowed to 2.8% in 2013 impacted by supply issues, including the drought in New Zealand.

Overall annual growth in the major Southern Hemisphere exporting countries of Argentina, Australia, New
Zealand and Uruguay was 3.8% lower overall than the previous year. In the Northern Hemisphere milk
production for the EU countries in aggregate was up just 0.7% in 2013.
Imports of dairy products into China were up 36% in 2013, with a decline in China's milk production of
5.7% over the same period. Rabobank estimates a consumption gal in China of almost 10 billion litres.

Russian production has been down 5/6% year on year for two consecutive years with the void being filled
by imports, predominantly cheese and milk fats, u p7.4% in 2013. Milk quota removal in the EU in July
2015 will allow European dairy farmers to expand production without the requirement to purchase milk
quota rights for the first time in 30 years.

Fonterra said the GDT prices on April 1 were 8.9% lower than the last event on March 18.

The total global diary trade was up and production was down.

Market Cap $613m.

FSF down 14 cents to $5.75
*TCL/Others: ACCC not to oppose acquisition of Qld Motorways Group

The consortium includes AustralianSuper Pty Ltd, Tawreed Investments Ltd, Transurban Holdings Ltd,

said in the report the ACCC concluded the acquisition of QM Group's tollroad operations in Queensland
would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition.

*XRO: Revenue for yr to March 31 up 83%, 2nd half loss in line with 1st half

from last year's $NZ38.4 million number.
With monthly committed subscriptions growing to $NZ7.8 million the recurring revenue model means that
Xero commences its 2015 financial year strongly with $NZ93 million in annualised subscriptions, up 81%
on the $NZ51.5 million reported for the same time last year. The net loss after tax for the second half of
the year ending March 31 2014 is expected to be similar to that reported for the first half, resulting in a full

758 employees, adding 376 employees in the 2014 financial year, and has $NZ210 million of cash to fund
its growth.

denominated in foreign currencies. On a constant currency basis Xero grew operating revenue by 92% in
the period.
