NSW-based Chinese developer JQZ has bought an industrial development site in Sydney's south
from a private investor for $46.8 million.
Spanning 14,600 square metres of land, the estate at 904 Bourke Street is one of the few
remaining larger development opportunities in south Sydney, according to Knight Frank director
Eugene Evgenikos.

"[Situated just] moments from Green Square station, the industrial estate has the potential to be
developed into 350 to 400 residential apartments in this rapidly emerging area," Mr Evgenikos
said.
"This development site ticked all the boxes with an amazing location, northerly aspect and a strong
income stream through several high-profile tenants including Gucci and Channel 7."

Eugene Evgenikos and Adam Bodon of Knight Frank negotiated the deal.

The building has seven tenants, all of whose leases expire by 2016.
JQZ, formerly known as Tong Group, develops and constructs residential projects in NSW.
Since being founded in 2005 it has developed apartments in Parramatta, Homebush, Harris Park,
Rockdale and Burwood.
The property is located within 400 metres of the $8 billion Green Square project, which is a
278-hectare development bordering the Green Square train station. That project has seen 5700
new homes built since 2000, and will include a major new town centre.
The Bourke Street estate is about 3.5 kilometres from the Sydney central business district and less
than 3 kilometres from the airport.
