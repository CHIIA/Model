Shares in lighting retailer Beacon Lighting Group surged on Tuesday's listing, in what is shaping to be
one of the strongest initial public offers of the past 12 months. The stock started trading at $1.06,
nearly double the offer price of 66¢. Despite fluctuating in early trade, the shares quickly settled and
closed at $1.06.

More than a quarter of the tradable shares changed hands in their first session after making their
debut higher than the target prices most investors in the IPO had set for the first 12 months.

"We were surprised. The stock had already pushed through our valuation at debut but we still plan to
hold it because we are happy with the long-term outlook for the business," BT Investment
Management smaller companies fund portfolio manager Noel Webster said.

Other participating institutions included Wilson Asset Management, Perpetual and Paradice
Investment Management. None were allocated the full portion of shares they requested.
The team at lead broker Morgans, rnu by Brisbane-based director and head of corporate finance
Sophie Mitchell, closed the subscription for the initial public offering in early March having raised
$63.855 million through the allocation of 96.75 million shares priced at 66¢ each. The deal valued
the company at $142 million. By Tuesday's close the company had a market capitalisation of
$227.9 million.

The light fixtures retailer did not raise any new capital through the float, which was a vehicle for Martin
Hanman, an electrician who has been a silent partner since 1997, to cash out his 45 per cent stake in
the chain that then comprised 13 stores. Such a rapid appreciation in value raises the question of
whether the brokers left too much value on the table.
Mr Hanman declined to comment and it is not known how much he paid for his stake originally.
However, according to Beacon's chief executive Glen Robinson Mr Hanman remains "more than
happy" with the pricing of the deal.
Beacon Lighting Group owns 71 stores and the brand runs another 14 as franchises. The company
plans to open six more fully owned stores each year for the next five years.
The company sources 90 per cent of its product directly, rather than going through wholesalers.
More than 80 per cent of stock is manufactured offshore, mostly in China, under the Beacon brand.
The business has an average gross sales margin of 64 per cent.
Three years ago the company started selling its designs to international lighting retailers, mostly
Europe, with a long-term strategy to grow the wholesale export business.
Pro forma sales revenue is expected to reach $150.26 million for the current financial year, while net
profit is estimated at $11.46 million.

1.4¢ a share fully franked.
