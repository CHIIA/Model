FUNDS: Recently listed property fund manager GDI Property Group is launching a new fund that
will hold a portfolio of industrial properties it bought from UGL while at the same time flagging the
redevelopment potential of its largest office asset in Sydney.
The group announced yesterday it would acquire seven properties from UGL for $66.5 million. The
six warehouses and one office building in NSW, Queensland and Western Australia are all leased to
UGL in a deal brokered by DTZ’s Greg Marr.

GDI is looking to raise $43.5m from unlisted property investors before moving ahead with the fund.
The company’s decision to forge ahead with its new unlisted fund comes as an approach to acquire
its office tower in central Sydney at 233 Castlereagh Street by Chinese player Visionary Investment
Group concluded without a sale and the company has now flagged a new course.
The group warned its earnings forecasts could be affected as it rejigged the tenancies in the building
to ready it for a sale to a residential developer.

“The anticipated impact of the likely revised asset management strategies is a possible reduction in
the funds from operations relating to the Sydney property, compared to the offer document
forecasts,” the company said.
“At this stage these amounts are unquantifiable, but GDI Property Group believes that the potential
value uplift from any residential conversion of the Sydney property would more than compensate
for a possible reduction in FFO relating to the Sydney property.”GDI listed in December at below its
$1 per share offer price and closed down 0.5c to 93.5c.
