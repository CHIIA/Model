10:55 EDT - Union workers at the world's biggest copper mine, the BHP Billiton-controlled Escondida
mine in Chile, walked off the job for 24 hours over demands for better working conditions. It is unclear
how big of an impact the strike is having on the operations at Escondida, but the union did say that it
would hold a second 24-hour strike on Wednesday unless several demands are met. The Escondida
mine produced 1.2 million tons of copper in the 2014 financial year, which ended in June.

10:37 EDT - Mexico's drop in unemployment last month to 4.9% from July's 5.2% was partly attributable
to fewer people in the workforce. August "labor-force participation [58.2% vs 59.3% in August 2013] was
the weakest August report in 10 years," says PNC. "Like in the US, the headline unemployment rate in
Mexico is understating the degree of slack in the labor market and economy." But the firm adds a drop in
underemployment shows employers are increasing workers' hours, "another sign that real GDP growth in
3Q should be solid." (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

1429 GMT [Dow Jones]--European banks' weak demand for cheap central bank funding is credit
negative, Moody's writes in a note, explaining that it "likely reflects a combination of too few profitable
lending opportunities for banks and their continued desire to deleverage and de-risk." Last Thursday, the
ECB said that it lent just EUR82.6 billion ($106.9 billion) in the first round of the four-year targeted
Longer-Term Refinancing Operation, or TLTRO. Under the program, announced in June to stimulate the
eurozone's sluggish economic recovery, the ECB is offering to lend money to banks on condition that the
banks in turn lend the money to select private sector borrowers. (josie.cox@wsj.com)

10:29 EDT - It looks like one of the Fed's most-outspoken hawks won't be around on the FOMC board
long enough to witness the rise in rates he's been arguing for in recent months. Philly Fed President
Charles Plosser announces he's retiring in March. He rotates out of a voting slot on the policy-setting
board next year and has cast dissenting votes the last 2 FOMC meetings, arguing Fed policy needs to
be more clearly tied to data--which has improved. At age 66, Plosser would have been subject to
mandatory retirement in 2016. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)

1414 GMT [Dow Jones]--France may have dodged a credit rating cut on Friday, but BNP Paribas
remains highly cautious and warns that the public debt-to-GDP ratio could be closing in on 100% by
2016. "The growth rate for 2015 has been set at 1.0%, instead of last year's targeted 1.7%, after the
2014 growth target was revised down from 1.0% to 0.4%," economists write in a note, adding that the
government estimates the 2014 general deficit to be 4.4% of GDP, way above the initial target of 3.8%.
"A different fiscal policy [to the one currently in place] would not improve the dynamics of the debt ratio
and could even worsen it," they write. (josie.cox@wsj.com)

Page107of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.1412 GMT [Dow Jones]--Catalonia's political conundrum hasn't got any easier to sort after Scotland
rejected independence last week, BNP Paribas says. Notes that the Catalonian administration is taking
steps to hold its own vote as planned, in open defiance of Madrid's warnings against, so a Madrid veto
on the Catalan government call for a referendum, when that happens, is to be expected. An early
Catalan election would be the logical way out of that deadlock, BNP Paribas adds, with an illegal vote as
the other, less likely, option. All the same, "a fresh election is unlikely to solve the political impasse, and
forming a government in Catalonia with a clear mandate on regional autonomy will be difficult."

10:12 EDT - National Association of Realtors economist Lawrence Yun says a smaller share of investors
buying properties led to last month's drop in existing-home sales. Investors accounted for 12% of sales
last month, down from the 20% seen most of this year. That comes as Yun notes there is a "clear signal
from the Federal Reserve that interest rates will be rising." As such, Yun says that's made other
investment options look more attractive. (eric.morath@wsj.com; @ericmorath)

1411 GMT [Dow Jones]--Eurozone consumer confidence fell for the fourth straight month in September,
and to its lowest level since February, likely reflecting disappointment with the anemic pace of the
recovery and the conflict in Ukraine. EU Commission said its preliminary measure of sentiment fell to
minus 11.4 from minus 10 in August, a larger deterioration than the drop to minus 10.5 that was forecast
by economists. The worsening of consumer confidence suggests the second-quarter pickup in spending
may already have run out of steam, leaving the economy dependent on high exports or a revival in
investment spending, which seems unlikely. It is also a vote of no confidence in the ECB's latest package
of stimulus measures, unveiled earlier this month, and as such suggests QE may eventually be required.

10:11 EDT - The drifting US dollar holds steady after a report showed an unexpected decline in
existing-home sales in August. USD at Y109.03 from Y109.04 before the report, while the euro holds on
to slight gains at $1.2837. The moves are modest given the dollar is in wait-and-see mode after a strong
rally since the start of the month. A slew of speeches from Fed officials this week may have more
influence on the buck as policymakers build their cases for when best to raise rates.

10:08 EDT - A decline in annualized home sales last month comes as the Fed last week noted the
housing sector "remains slow." The rate was also down 5.3% from a year ago, and housing's lackluster
rebound in the longer run has been a major factor holding back the economic recovery. "There have
been a variety of headwinds resulting from the crisis that have slowed growth...these headwinds will
dissipate only slowly," Yellen said during last week's press conference. "An example would be the fact
that mortgage credit really is at this point available really to those with pristine credit."

1359 GMT [Dow Jones]--Core eurozone government bond yields edged lower Monday after China's
Finance Minister said that the government would keep monetary policy steady, dashing hopes of more
aggressive easing. Equity markets slipped lower, forcing core bonds yields lower/prices higher in light
turnover. German Bunds also remained underpinned by worries over the near non-existent level of
inflation and growth in the eurozone, with full-blown QE seen as the most likely answer to these
problems. Gilts remain stuck in the middle of a two-month, 2.35%/2.65% range. 10-year Bunds yield
0.98% and 10-year gilts yield 2.50%. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

09:55 EDT - Nearly one-third of homes sold in July went to buyers who didn't take out a mortgage,
according to CoreLogic. While that's still an elevated share of all-cash sales, it's down from a peak of
45% in early 2012. Over the past year, all-cash sales have accounted for around 37% of all sales, down
from a peak of around 43% in late 2011 and early 2012, when home prices reached bottom. During
normal times, cash sales account for around one quarter of sales. A declining share of all-cash sales is a
sign that investors are withdrawing from more housing markets, but could also signal that more buyers
are getting qualified for mortgages. (nick.timiraos@wsj.com; @NickTimiraos)
