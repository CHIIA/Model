0127 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is flat Tuesday as falls in iron ore miners offset gains
in banks and other dividend plays. Rio Tinto (RIO.AU) falls 0.5% after spot iron ore hit a 2-month low,
while banks rise 0.1%-0.3% and Telstra (TLS.AU), QBE (QBE.AU) and Woodside (WPL.AU) rise
0.4%-0.6% before upcoming dividend payments. "I think the market is a bit tired," says
marketmatters.com.au principal Shawn Hickman. "But it's a dangerous time to be short the iron ore
miners as China is likely to stimulate again in the second half. And you still have dividend support for
banks and Telstra while global bond yields remain low." Focus remains on earnings reports, with Boart
Longyear (BLY.AU) down 10% after it gave cautious earnings guidance despite a narrower first-half loss.
McMillan Shakespeare (MMS.AU) gains 4.3% on positive guidance for fiscal 2015.

0123 GMT [Dow Jones] The Canadian dollar/yen cross sank as low as 94.52 Tuesday as it extends its
retreat from Monday's six-week high of 95.30 on dovish comments from Bank of Canada Governor
Stephen Poloz. Mr. Poloz said BOC's policy is "quite capable of being fully independent" from the Fed,
and the 1% level of the BOC's key overnight rate is "a high number" compared with peers who are
starting at zero. Dow Jones technical analysis shows a bearish shooting-star candlestick pattern was
completed Monday on the CAD/JPY daily price chart, and the spot rate has fallen below the uptrend
support line that runs from the Aug. 8 swing low of 92.71. The cross may slip further in the near term to
its 55-day moving average (now at 94.43), and then to the base of the daily Ichimoku cloud (now at
94.34), followed by its 200-day moving average (now at 94.19). Spot CAD/JPY is at 94.56.

0106 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities are seen falling in early trading as investors cool off after
the Hang Seng Index set fresh highs for the year on Monday. The benchmark gained 0.2% to 25,166.91,
and index futures are down 0.7% ahead of the market open. Emerging market equities "are likely to
consolidate with an upward bias as mood in global markets is positive after S&P 500 closed at a record
overnight," says Credit Agricole. Chinese corporate earnings season continues, with companies
including Agricultural Bank of China (1288.HK), COSCO Pacific (1199.HK) and Henderson Land
Development Company (0012.HK) among the companies scheduled to report earnings today.

0103 GMT [Dow Jones] The New Zealand dollar slipped to a four-day low of 86.46 against the yen
Tuesday after Statistics New Zealand said the country recorded a NZ$692 million trade deficit for July,
wider than the consensus forecast of a NZ$500 million deficit. Diminished investor risk appetite as
Tokyo stocks post modest losses (Japan's Nikkei Stock Average is down 0.09% at 15,599.79) is also
weighing on the risk-sensitive Kiwi. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the NZD/JPY spot rate falling
below the base of a bearish flag pattern. The cross could slip further in the near term to 86.30
(Wednesday's reaction low), and then to 85.96 (Aug. 12 minor pivot low). Resistance is expected at
86.85 (middle 20-day Bollinger Band), then at 87.22 (upper 20-day one-standard deviation Bollinger
Band). Spot NZD/JPY is at 86.62 versus 86.76 late Monday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

says Diana Mousina, economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Leading indicators of
non-mining business investment continue to point to a sustained pick up in growth, she says. Mousina
notes that a significant lift in commercial finance commitments over the past six months suggests we
should see non-mining investment lift toward the end of the year. She also says that business surveys
have shown a marked improvement for confidence and trading conditions but also in expected
investment plans. Official government data excludes investment in sectors like health and education
where investment is growing strongly. 2Q business investment data is due out on
Thursday.(james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0024 GMT [Dow Jones] The Aussie/Kiwi cross reached 1.1169 Tuesday--its highest mark since Dec. 2,
2013--after Statistics New Zealand said the country recorded a NZ$692 million trade deficit for July,
wider than the consensus forecast of a NZ$500 million deficit. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the
AUD/NZD daily price chart is positive-biased as the five- and 15-day moving averages are advancing.
The cross is poised to advance further in the near term to 1.1223--the Nov. 29, 2013 reaction high.
Support is expected at 1.1065--base of "buy zone" of the 20-day Bollinger Band (an area between the
one- and two-standard deviation upper Bollinger bands); and then at 1.1002 (middle 20-day Bollinger
Band). Spot AUD/NZD is at 1.1148 versus 1.1132 late Monday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0022 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar has continued in a narrow range overnight, despite another
leg down in the spot iron ore price, says David de Garis, senior economist at NAB. Iron ore fell another
1.0% to US$89.2/ton, putting "within a whisker" of its post global financial crisis lows of US$86.70/ton
reached in September 2012, he added. "It's just another reason to frustrate the Reserve Bank of
Australia on the continuing divergence between the Australian dollar and Australia's terms of trade," Mr.
de Garis said. The Australian dollar was trading in early Asia at US$0.9275. (james.glynn@wsj.com;

0011 GMT [Dow Jones] The strong NZD and falling commodity prices are starting to affect New
Zealand's trade position "which contributed to a larger-than-expected July trade deficit," ANZ says. And
while "the annual trade surplus widened" this looks to be on borrowed time, it says. The NZD/USD is now
close to 0.0500 below last month's peak and the adjustment of the NZD to lower commodity prices
appears to be happening. "However, the NZD remains a roadblock to export-sector earnings and wider
economic activity--underscoring the need to lift productivity to remain viable."

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZ July merchandise trade deficit was larger than Westpac or the market
expected, "due to a larger than expected drop in export receipts," Westpac senior economist Michael
Gordon in a note. "We suspect that the surprise is largely due to normal monthly volatility in export
volumes, given that the fall in world prices for dairy and logs was already known." He adds that Westpac
had expected the import bill to include the first of Air New Zealand's new Boeing 787
Dreamliners--probably worth around NZ$200m; "However, Statistics NZ excluded this item from the trade
figures in order to keep the purchase price confidential."(lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter:

2329 GMT [Dow Jones] While Australia's labor market has deteriorated over recent years, Barclays,
Australia chief economist Kieran Davies said he thinks the recent rise in unemployment it 12-year highs
is overstated. The jump in unemployment in July to 6.4% from 6.0% is typically seen in a deep recession,
he said. Davies adds the backdrop for the labor market has actually improved this year. Companies are
hiring again, job ads are up and surveyed business conditions have improved. Importantly, capacity
utilization has trended higher, which normally foreshadows falling unemployment, he said. This suggests
that unemployment could peak this year, far sooner than the Reserve Bank's bleak forecast that
unemployment will stay high until 2016. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

2315 GMT [Dow Jones] The decline in AUD may accelerate this week according to BNP Paribas. It notes
the 2Q private sector capex will be released Thursday and "there is a risk of a third straight negative
print, which would weigh on the AUD given that FX markets remain long according to BNP Paribas
Positioning Analysis." It is currently short AUD/CAD and "we see the AUD as vulnerable this week."
AUD/CAD is at 1.0206 while AUD/USD is at 0.9285. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter:

2311 GMT [Dow Jones] Europe's problems remain the major focus for markets as German confidence
continues to decline and French politics remains turbulent, says ANZ Bank - noting Hollande has been
forced into his third major ministerial reshuffle in two years. The result was new record lows in Bund
yields and Belgium two year yields dropping into negative territory for the first time. However "European
equities are following the U.S. model and rallying on speculation that the ECB may be closer to acting," it
says. Draghi's emphasis on fiscal policy at Jackson Hole - in suggesting that national structural policies
need to step up to the plate - mean European politics remain key in analysing the direction for EUR, says

is perceived to be a German imposed policy in Europe," it says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter:
