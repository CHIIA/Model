LONDON--Leyshon Energy Ltd. (LEN.LN) said Monday it is well advanced in the interim testing
program at the Zijinshan gas project located in the Ordos Basin in central China, although results so
far are below its expectations for this area of the field.
The energy focused company, with its main operating office located in Beijing, added that it is
actively progressing its interest in a number of acquisition opportunities in the region.

"The results, along with our understanding of well performance in nearby fields, are however
sufficiently encouraging to proceed with drilling an additional exploration well, ZJS8", it said, adding
that discussions on the location and design of this well with the Company's partner have started.
The interim testing program now has an estimated cost of around $4 million and, depending on the
timing and results from Well ZJS8, is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The cost
includes the drilling and testing of Well ZJS8.
The Company said it has finalized the documentation related to the interim testing program and the
exploration license has been renewed until May, 2016.
Shares at 0935 GMT unchanged at 4 pence valuing the company at 10 million pound ($16.28
million).
