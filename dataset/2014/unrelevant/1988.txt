*BYI: NPAT down 15/20% on pcp, div unchanged, strong balance sheet, no debt

Beyond International Ltd advised for the 2014 financial year, as a result of changes to the production cycle

be approximately 15/20% beow that achieved in 2013.

Previous seasons of Mythbusters had a production cycle typically of 30 episodes produced across 18
months. The latest season has changed to 13 episodes across 12 months. Also due to budgetary
constraints at several client broadcasters, producton projects have been deferred.

The Beyond balance sheet remains strong and debt free. Dividends are expected to remain at current
levels. (Jun 23)
