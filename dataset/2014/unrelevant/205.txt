OSAKA -- Chugoku Electric Power is acquiring a partial interest in an Australian coal mine -- the latest
of many moves by Japanese power companies toward conventional energy with nuclear reactors still
on lockdown after the 2011 disaster.
The utility will purchase a 10% interest in the Boggabri coal mine in New South Wales from a wholly
owned subsidiary of compatriot Idemitsu Kosan, according to Monday's announcement. The deal will
likely be worth over 10 billion yen ($96.7 million).

Chugoku Electric also signed a long-term sale contract to secure a stable supply amid rising demand
from China and India. It plans to purchase about 700,000 tons of coal annually for at least five years.
This would account for more than 10% of the 6 million tons it buys yearly and bring down costs for the
company.
The utility relies on coal for more than 50% of the electricity it generates, which is the highest
proportion of all the domestic power companies. Nuclear power had only accounted for about 15%
even before the 2011 Fukushima disaster.
With construction of its Kaminoseki nuclear plant plagued by severe delays, it sees coal, which is
cheaper than liquefied natural gas or crude oil, becoming even more central to its operations.

Other companies are also increasing their reliance on fossil fuels. Tokyo Electric Power aims to boost
its annual LNG procurement from about 25 million tons to a maximum of 40 million tons, through a
comprehensive tie-up covering everything from purchasing fuel to generating power. It hopes for a
partnership that will give it a better bargaining position and cut procurement costs by 20%.

Meanwhile, Tepco and Kansai Electric Power will start importing shale gas from the U.S.
Companies are building new coal-fired plants as well. Electric Power Development, also known as
J-Power, is building a 600,000kW plant in the city of Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture, with Nippon Steel &
Sumitomo Metal. Chubu Electric and Tepco are jointly building a similar-sized facility in Tokai, also in
Ibaraki. Kobe Steel has revealed plans to construct a 1.4 million kilowatt plant as well.

Fossil fuels accounted for 62% of the electricity generated by the 10 domestic power companies in
fiscal 2010 but increased to 88% in fiscal 2013. Meanwhile, fuel costs jumped from 3.6 trillion yen to
7.7 trillion yen in the same period.
