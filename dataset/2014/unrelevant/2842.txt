down tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping's saying the nation needs to adapt to a "new normal" in the pace
of economic growth (Bloomberg report) does not create huge optimism.

"Ceiling 5475. Floor 5437. Close at 5457, down 3.8 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open slightly
higher with the local futures contract up 1 point.

"I remain steadfast in my view that our market remains entrenched in an intermediate term topping
process.

"Index and sector leadership is bearish with risk and growth underperforming. New 52-week lows are
outpacing new 52-week highs. Deflationary pressures are building. Now not all the ducks have lined up in
a row just yet, and given the lack of urgency in the current decline off the top, it is highly likely our market
will print another rally high going forward or at least test the prior high. But none of this matters for today.
The ceiling will be 5475. The floor will be 5437. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5457, down 3.8 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 16 points to 5460.8 last Friday.

Business confidence improves in April vs March

The National Australia Bank in its report today said business conditions reversed all their gains from
March, pointing to the fact that activity is yet to pick up to the levels expected from confidence numbers.

Page104of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Business conditions fell to zero in April, from one point in March, back to the same level seen in February,
said National Australia Bank in their monthly survey.

A slightly more positive jobs market helped business confidence rise two points to six in April, after falling
three points to four in March.

Conditions remain volatile and mixed across industries: 'bellwether' sectors (wholesale, transport) are still
soft with near term conditions likely to remain sluggish – forward orders fell sharply.

NAB said its indicators, in the near-term, are likely to experience continued weakness, with forward orders
deteriorating and businesses reluctant to restock.

Confidence maybe be improving across the board for Australia businesses, but it is still quite negative in
the mining sector, Mr Oster said, and given its importance to the local economy, may have a trickle on
affect.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS

*AZJ: Seeks to terminate the 14 existing Qld based Enterprise Agreements

Aurizon Ltd announced it will be making an application to the Fair Work Commission to terminate the 14
existing Queensland based Enterprise Agreements (EA's). Aurizon has been bargaining with union
representatives extensively since April 2013 and has completed more than 70 years of bargaining. Despite
these efforts eaningful progress towards the agreement of new EA's has not been achieved.

On March 4 2014 Deputy President Asbury of the Fair Work Commission wrote" The discussion on hours
of work is typical of the way in which the negotiations have proceeded and indicates the likelihood of
reaching agreement is virtually nil".

The current 14 Queensland EA's nominally expired at end December 2013. They were agreed almost four
years ago, prior to privatisation in 2010 to give effect to an agreement between the then Queensland
Government and the unions that employees' terms and conditions would be protected for three years.

In effect this means there have been no significant productivity or efficiency changes in the Queensland
EA's in six years, since the previous agreements were negotiated in 2008 while employees have received
wage increases of at least 4% per year over the life of those agreements.

If the EA's are terminated the terms and conditions of employment will be regulated by The Rail Industry
Award 2010, the National Employment Standards and Employees' individual contracts of employment.

Page106of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Incitec Pivot managing director and CEO James Fazzino said in the presentation the result confirmed the
strength of IPL's strategic focus on driving returns from existing operations whole growing the business in
line with the company's strategy to leverage dislocations in the world's two largest economies - the
industrialisation and urbanisation of China and the shale gas revolution in the US.

Mr Fazzino said the medium term strategic platforms were the Moranbah ammonium nitrate complex
which is planned to achieve production of 330,000 tonnes a year from 2015 and the Louisiana ammonia
plant, under construction with first production expected in 2016. "Both projects should really 'move the dial'
and result in a step change in EBITDA for their respective businesses. This financial year Moranbah is
expected to produce 300,000 tonnes generating approximately $140 million in EBITDA for the Dyno
Nobel Asia Pacific business' the MD said in the report.

Analysts expectations: $107.6 mln, div 3.3c/ consensus forecast by the Financial Times of 28 polled
investment analysts covering Incitec Pivot Limited advised that the company will outperform the market.
This has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts improved on Dec 09,
2013. The previous consensus forecast advised investors to hold their position in Incitec Pivot Limited.

There were 5 buy recommendations, 7 outperforms and 11 holds.

*On March 13 a leading broker lifted its price target on Incitec Pivot to $3.16 from $3.08 while retaining a
"buy" on the stock, saying diammonium phosphate (DAP) prices remain the key driver pf earnings
changes for Incitec, with a $US10/tonne move impacting group EBIT by 2% of $9 million, all else being
equal.

The broker said it believes DAP prices can be sustained around current levels albeit This relies on
improved import demand from India, which has historically made up 35% of global seaborne trade.
The broker expects net profit to be flat in the March half year at $A110 million despite an expected 15%
increase in EBIT (IPL reports for the first half on May 12). The broker expects a 30/70 skew to the 2nd
half. Moranbah remains the key swing factor to earnings.

Coretrack Ltd announced it has signed an agreement with unlisted oil and gas ceramic "proppant"
developer Ecopropp, based in Queensland, to acquire 100% of Ecopropp shares paid for in scrip following
the achievement of three agreed milestones.

The deal provides exposure for coretrack shareholders to the booming Hydraulic fracturing market. With
many horizontal deep oil and g as wells now requiring approximately $1/3 million worth of proppants
during hydraulic fracturing, Coretrack Chairman Matt Birney said in the report "We feel that the unique
proppant developed by Ecopropp has the potential to lead the industry given its ultra light weight and
ability to withstandthe very high pressures in deep wells'.

Ecopropp MD Siegfried Konig said in the report Ecopropp's proppant technology now meets the American
Petroleum Institute and ISO certifying authority guidelines and is more than ready to be taken to the next
level via public listing. He said "Ecopropp's ceramic proppants have been specifically engineered for oil

Page108of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.and gas wells that are deeper than two kilometres, not for shallow coal seam gas or coal bed methane
wells which are often only 300/500m deep".

Coretrack will own 100% of Ecopropp after three milestones have been achieved. The two companies
have agreed a budget of $2./1 million for which Coretrack subject to certain conditions, will provide
working capital for the period to October 2016, also other terms.
Ecopropp proppants can be produced anywhere in the world where a coal fired power station and related
resources exist, which dramatically lowers the logistics costs of transporting proppants.

*SHV: Almond demand rising/harvest 85% complete/wet conditions may impact

Select Harvests managing director Paul Thompson reported world almond prices have firmed following the
release of the US April Almond industry position report on May 9 reflecting the continuing strong demand
for almonds. US domestic market shipments are up 11.3% year to date and export shipments are up 1.3%
with total shipments up 4.3%. The current forecast shows the carry over inventory will be 261.7 million
pounds, 17.4% lower than last year end.

Global demand remains strong from food processors, food ervice and confectioners.

With regard to Select Harvests' current crop, Mr Thompson said with additional investment in harvest
equipment in 2013, the company had been able to harvest 84% of its farms by Aprl 29 despite rain
disruption, resulting in increased harvesting and processing costs. Continued rainfall in NSW sinc then has
prevented the harvesting of the remaining 16% of the crop. The wet, cold conditions have resulted in some
nut drop, further increasing the probability of product deterioration.

Until all of the remaining 2013/14 crop is harvested and processed, SHV is not in a position to determine
with any certainty the impact of this year's wet harvest conditions on yield and quality.
