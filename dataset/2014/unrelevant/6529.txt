Asian stocks edged higher on Wednesday, taking a positive lead from the U.S., while Mitsui Fudosan
sank in Tokyo after announcing a share offering.

The region moved higher after stocks in the U.S. hit a new high overnight, with the S&P 500 closing at
its second straight record as the market came back online following Monday's public holiday.

The gains in Asia however were modest, as markets waited for bigger catalysts. The next major data
point for the region will be China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index, due over the
weekend, where investors will be looking to see if it can match the pickup seen in HSBC's preliminary
measure last week.

Australia's S&P ASX 200 was up 0.2% as Sydney hit a four-week high, South Korea's Kospi added
0.4%, and Singapore's Straits Times Index was up less than 0.1%.
"From an equity strategy perspective ultralow volatility and ultralow trading volumes concern me
tactically," said Bell Potter's managing director Charlie Aitken in Sydney. "That suggests to me the
foundation of equity markets at these index levels are not as sturdy as prices would suggest."
In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose by 0.1% and the Shanghai Composite was also 0.1%
higher.

In Japan, the Nikkei Share Average was 0.3% higher, on track for its fifth consecutive gain, as the yen
was steady against the dollar--last trading at Yen101.94 to the dollar.
In corporate news, Mitsui Fudosan Co. sank 6.4% in Japan after the real-estate firm announced that it
would raise up to Yen325 billion via a share offering--the company's first in three decades. The firm
said it plans to use the proceeds from its offering to invest in office buildings and retail facilities in Japan
as well as Olympics-related projects ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games.
Also in Japan, Yamada Denki Co. jumped 4.8% on news of a Yen100 billion convertible bond deal,
while in Australia QBE Insurance Group gained 2.7% after Macquarie upgraded the insurer.
