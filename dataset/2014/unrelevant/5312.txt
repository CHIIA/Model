BHP Billiton yesterday turned to the historic Mt Windarra mine to feed its hungry Leinster
concentrator after the mining giant’s unloved Nickel West division signed an offtake agreement
with Poseidon Nickel.
With Swiss giant Glencore and China’s Jinchuan frontrunners in the long-running Nickel West
auction, BHP has locked in a contract to February 2017 to process Mt Windarra ore.

The offtake deal, flagged by WestBusiness in February and hailed as “revolutionary” by Poseidon
managing director David Singleton yesterday, is for a minimum 350,000 tonnes of ore annually but
can be expanded to 700,000t by mutual agreement.
Nickel West will purchase all the concentrate produced at Leinster, in a similar arrangement to the
status quo BHP maintains at Kambalda with nickel miners Mincor Resources, Independence Group
and Panoramic Resources.
Mr Singleton said the Leinster concentrator was running at 10 per cent of its near three million
tonne-a-year capacity, following the closure of the earthquake-hit Perseverance mine in December.

“The fact BHP has been able to sign this contract suggests there is a lot of confidence in the Nickel
West business going forward,” he said.
Mr Singleton said the deal would cut $240 million from the start-up costs for Mt Windarra.

The discovery of the mine, near Laverton, sparked the 1960s nickel boom but it has been closed
since 1990.

Mr Singleton said financing talks were “well advanced” but Andrew Forrest, who controls 25 per
cent of Poseidon shares, had already “done the hard yards” and was unlikely to bankroll the mine
redevelopment.
Costs are expected to be less than $20 million.
First ore deliveries from Mt Windarra are due by February.

“I am very confident about the ability of the normal investment market,” Mr Singleton said.
“I don’t want to talk for Andrew but he believes the company is good enough to get funded.”

Poseidon shares closed up 3.7 per cent yesterday at 19.2¢.
