China's Yanzhou Abandons Planned Buyout of Australia's Yancoal -- Update

SYDNEY--China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. Monday abandoned a planned buyout of Yancoal
Australia Ltd., walking away from an all-scrip proposal to take the Australian coal producer private as
prices for the fuel languish at multiyear lows.
Hong Kong-listed Yanzhou, one of China's largest coal-mining companies, last July announced plans
to buy out minority investors in the Australian company--in which it holds a 78% stake--and delist the
stock. Other shareholders include Singaporean commodities trader Noble Group Ltd.

Analysts said the decision by Yanzhou to drop its bid for the company was unsurprising given
continued falls in the price of coal, and subsequently, in the share prices of both companies. Coal
markets have been hurt by a glut of raw material, as supply rises from mining operations in hubs like
Australia and demand growth in Asia eases.
Thermal-coal prices in Australia last week fell to around US$73 a metric ton--their lowest since
late-2009.

"Yanzhou today notified Yancoal that [it] no longer wishes to pursue with its indicative nonbinding
proposal regarding the possible privatization of Yancoal Australia," executives at Yancoal said in a
statement to the Australian Securities Exchange, without elaborating further.

A spokesman for Yancoal said he couldn't provide details for why Yanzhou decided to pull the bid. A
spokesperson for Yanzhou wasn't immediately available.

Support from Noble Group, which hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as its adviser following news of the
offer last year, would have been crucial to getting the deal completed. Noble holds about 13% of
Yancoal's stock.

When it proposed the buyout last year, Yanzhou said it would need to hold further talks with
independent directors of Yancoal before deciding whether or not to move ahead with a formal bid,
although it said it would likely be able to better manage the impact of weak coal prices if it had full
control of the Australian unit.
Yancoal operates or has a stake in 10 coal mines in New South Wales, Western Australia and
Queensland states.

Last December, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey relaxed ownership restrictions on Yanzhou, which
had committed in 2009 to sell down its holding so it could secure government approval for a A$3.5
billion (US$3.2 billion) takeover of Felix Resources Ltd., then the biggest Chinese investment in an
Australian company. The restrictions would have forced Yanzhou to reduce its stake below 70% by
the end of last year.

Mr. Hockey left the door open to takeover by saying he had "no in-principle objection" to 100% foreign
ownership of the company, as long as it wasn't considered to be "contrary to the national interest."
Shares in Yancoal Australia have fallen by more than half since the company was listed in mid-2012.
They slumped 9.4% Monday after Yanzhou dumped its proposal.

the start of the year. On Monday, Yanzhou rose 6.7% compared with a 1.5% lift in the Hang Seng
Index.

Analysts said a deal could still be resurrected in future.
"Yanzhou already owns more than 70% of the company, so these two are going to be inextricably
linked for some time to come," said Patersons Securities Analyst Matthew Trivett. "I don't think this is
the end of it."

Australia has been struggling to maintain investment in its mines, which are the biggest suppliers of
coal to China. Companies like BHP Billiton Ltd. and Peabody Energy Corp. have been laying off
workers and shelving plans for expansions after the sharp fall in prices.
As a state-owned company, Yanzhou has greater access to capital than the Australian unit. This gives
it more firepower to expand existing mines in eastern Australia or invest in new projects.
Yancoal recorded a loss of A$832.1 million in 2013, compared with a profit of A$375.4 million the
year earlier.
