Roc said it would receive a A$1 million (US$924,959) upfront cash payment followed by a A$5 million
contingent contingent consideration, subject to first hydrocarbons from a commercial
development.Cooper will take over operatorship and all of Roc’s remaining liabilities at BMG, which the
latter said would result in a reversal of its abandonment obligation with a resulting profit of roughly US$32
million.“With Roc’s strategy progressively increasing our business focus in South East Asia and China,
we have concluded that a BMG gas development is no longer a core project for the business,” Roc chief
executive Alan Linn said.“As a consequence of the sale, Roc has increased its capacity to develop value
growth opportunities within our core operating regions and create value and returns for our shareholders.
The sale generated a profit of about US$32 million and removed a significant potential future
abandonment obligation for Roc.”Cooper revealed in a separate statement that it had also reached a deal
to take a 15% stake from Beach Energy, which had held the remaining 50% equity in the fields, giving
Cooper a 65% stake and Beach the remaining 35% equity.The BMG fields were previously developed
for oil production buthave been in a non-production phase since 2010 when operations were suspended
after a full field gas development was considered non-commercial.Since then, the joint venture partners
have completed a detailed development review designed to understand the most efficient routes to bring
BMG gas and liquids to market.Cooper managing director David Maxwell said BMG’s proximity to existing
infrastructure and developed and undeveloped gas fields was favourable for the prospects of
commercialisation.“BMG is a conventional gas source, with some infrastructure in place and the potential
for economic enhancement through coordination with adjacent developed and undeveloped fields,” he
said.“We believe BMG can be a highly competitive source of supply for gas customers and good business
for shareholders at recent and anticipated gas prices.”Maxwell added that the company’s near term focus
would be to evaluate development options for BMG and determine the optimal plan for the fields’ next
stage of development as a gas project.The sale of Roc’s interest will be effective 1 January 2014, subject
to regulatory approval.The BMG fields stretch over production licences VIC/L26, VIC/L27 and VIC/L28
and lie in water depths ranging from between 100 metres and 200 metres.
