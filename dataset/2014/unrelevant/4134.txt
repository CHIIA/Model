2326 GMT [Dow Jones] Comments by Woodside (WPL.AU) CEO Peter Coleman poured cold water on
the prospect of large-scale capital management, says J.P. Morgan, noting he highlighted Woodside's
growth bent by talking up the prospect of M&A worth US$5 billion. The CEO said more assets are
coming on the market as Woodside's peer group refocuses toward America and some of the sector
majors look to improve their balance sheet. Meanwhile, prices are improving as the appetite of national
oil companies for deals fades. J.P. Morgan forecasts Woodside will be in a net cash position by year end
and a US$5 billion acquisition would see net gearing at a very manageable 22%. Lifts price target to
A$41.17 from A$40.69, keeps Neutral rating. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2325 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank of America Merrill Lynch keeps its underperform rating and A$37.50 target
price on Wesfarmers (WES.AU) as it trades at 22 times expected FY15 earnings, yet earnings are
expected to fall next year. "In fiscal 2014, four Wesfarmers businesses went backwards in earnings--and
in fiscal 2015 (combined with the elimination of Insurance earnings), three businesses are forecast to go
backwards," the broker says. "For a conglomerate to deliver above market growth in earnings, to justify a
premium valuation, we believe none of its businesses should post negative growth." WES last A$45.66.

2310 GMT [Dow Jones]--USD/JPY may trade in a 103.50-104.00 range during Asian trading after it
climbed higher following the release of minutes from the most recent FOMC meeting. The minutes
showed the U.S. central bank was gradually shifting its stance in a more hawkish direction. "Eyes will
now be on Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's speech Friday at Jackson Hole," says Junichi Ishikawa,
market analyst at IG Securities. He said the pair could test the Y104 level and key resistance at Y104.13
if Yellen sticks to a hawkish tone. "Until then, I think we will be seeing the pair moving in a narrow range,"
he says. He tips EUR/USD in a 1.3230-1.3300 range. USD/JPY is at 103.73, and EUR/USD is at 1.3258.

2302 GMT [Dow Jones] The latest move by Brazil's central bank to spur greater lending may not do the
trick according to Fitch Ratings. The reasons: Brazil's banks are nervous about deteriorating borrower
credit quality as the country's economy slows. The central bank on Wednesday eased reserve
requirements on certain deposits, the second time in a month that it has done so in an effort to jumpstart
growth. But Fitch says Brazil's bankers are growing more conservative. The country's largest private
banks, for example, are targeting higher-quality borrowers and looking to make shorter-term loans. Most
analysts expect Brazil's economy to grow less than 1% this year; some are predicting recession.

2300 GMT [Dow Jones]--Westpac Banking's (WBC.AU) third-quarter capital update indicates its
asset-quality metrics continue to improve and domestic housing-credit growth has returned to the levels
of the wider financial system, says J.P. Morgan. On the back of that, the brokerage is nudging up its
fiscal 2014 earnings forecast by slightly less than 1% to just under A$7.6 billion--which still leaves it
modestly below consensus. It remains overweight and raised its price target to A$35.38/share from
A$34.99. WBC last traded at A$34.88. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2249 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter executive director Charlie Aitken upgrades Fortescue (FMG.AU) to a
High Conviction Buy from Buy. "Fortescue now meets all my criteria of being value, having
underperformed, being heavily shorted (15.8% of free float), dividend growth, earnings upgrades, a U.S.

FMG last A$4.55. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

10:42 GMT [Dow Jones] Total job advertising fell a seasonally adjusted 2.7% in July, "unwinding much of
June's lift. Momentum has cooled in recent months," according to the ANZ monthly job ads survey.
Nationwide Internet job advertising fell 1.9% in July while newspaper job advertising fell 8.0% in July.
The "level of job advertising is consistent with continuing but more modest employment growth. We
expect the unemployment rate to edge under 5.5% by year's end," says ANZ Economist Sharon Zollner.

2240 GMT [Dow Jones] Argentina's economy shrank 2.3% in July from the same month a year ago, says
Orlando J Ferreres & Asociados, a leading consulting firm. In the first seven months of the year, the
economy contracted 1.1% from the same period in 2013. OJF's estimate is more pessimistic than that
presented by Argentina's Economy Ministry, whose data are questioned by economists. The ministry
said economic activity was unchanged in June, for instance, while OJF said it had shrunk 0.6%. The
ministry won't publish its July data until next month. Whatever the case, most economists expect the
economy to shrink sharply in 2014. (taos.turner@wsj.com; @taos)

2235 GMT [Dow Jones] Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AU) may be paying out 80% of its profits as
dividends, but RBC Capital Markets poses a question: are capex options emerging? The broker says the
outlook has changed since Woodside's 2Q update. Notably, the Browse LNG project offshore Western
Australia state continues to edge closer to a decision on whether to start early design work, possibly
around the end of 2H 2014, while new options have emerged in Canada at Grassy Point and Kitimat
where Apache (APA) and a number of other oil companies are actively seeking buyers for some assets.
"We suggest it's possible Woodside could reenter a significant capex draw phase from end 2015," RBC
says. The broker rates Woodside at underperform with a A$43.00 price target. WPL last traded at
A$43.38. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
18:33 EDT - Google Capital, the growth equity investment arm of Google (GOOGL), led a $100M
investment in San Francisco-based services marketplace startup Thumbtack, done at a valuation around
$800M. The deal is the latest move by the search giant to connect with interesting technologies through
targeted investment vehicles. Google Capital, formed last year, has made a half-dozen investments so
far across a variety of industries. Another Google investment arm, Google Ventures, backs earlier-stage
startups. (lizette.chapman@wsj.com)

18:30 EDT - JPMorgan stays Overweight on Brambles (BXB.AU) as sales improve on the back of
stronger global economic growth. "We believe the strategy to drive increased asset utilization, thereby
increasing operating cash-flows to reinvest in growth opportunities and its focus on improving its Return
on Capital Employed to 20% by FY19 is sound," the broker says. "In the short term, though, this may
lead to some margin compression." Target rises to A$9.77 from A$9.41. BXB last A$9.33.
(david.rogers@wsj.com; @DavidRogersWSJ)

18:28 EDT - H-P (HPQ) gives investors a little mystery to stew over. On its earnings conference call
Wednesday, HPQ says its ability to do share buybacks was limited in the quarter ended July 31 "due to
material non-public information." An HPQ spokeswoman declined to say whether that was a reference to
an acquisition the company was trying to do, or some other event that legally restricted HPQ from
stock repurchases. (shira.Ovide@wsj.com; @ShiraOvide)
