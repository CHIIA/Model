Australand Property Group and joint-venture partner LaSalle Investment Management have won the
right to buy and develop land owned by UrbanGrowth NSW in North Ryde, Sydney for a price
believed to be about $50 million.
The 1.3-hectare site, adjacent to the newly completed North Ryde train station 15 kilometres
north-east of the Sydney central business district, is expected to yield up to 400 apartments in several
buildings.

Australand's executive general manager for residential Rod Fehring said the group's win was an
endorsement of "our capability to deliver significant urban infill projects". The property neighbours a
former Goodman Groupsite which sold to Chinese residential developer Country Garden Australia
for $73 million last year. That site has the capacity to hold 600-700 apartments with an end value of
more than $500 million.
The new site to be developed by Australand and LaSalle forms part of the North Ryde Urban
Activation Precinct, which was recently approved by the state government and is the first site to be
released within the precinct.

Australand managing director Bob Johnston said he looked forward to expanding the relationship with
LaSalle following success with projects in Wolli Creek and Clemton Park. Australand is a takeover
target by listed diversified property group Stockland.
