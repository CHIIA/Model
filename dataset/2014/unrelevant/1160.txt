MARKET LED DOWN BY BANKS, MINERS AND LOWER THAN EXPEC JOBS
Our market closed down 25.2 points to 5428.8 on light volume worth $3.5 billion with both the banking
sector and resources each contributing 7.8 negative points to the index, and all sectors except property
down on the day.

The Aussie job number for May, seasonally adjusted, came in below expectations (unemployment
remained steady at 5.8% but the number of jobs fell 4,800 last month, against an expectation for a gain
of 10,000). The $A was at 93.89US c, up about 15 points from last evening.

*The highlight of the day was the New Zealand dollar, that rose 1.3% against the US currency after the
Reserve Bank lifted interest rates again to curb inflation and signalled it may have to be lifted again.
*Wesfarmers closed down 21c to $41.61 on 1.79m shares, also announced sale of insurance assets has
achieved regulatory sanction and will result in a small profit.

*Mineral Resources fell 44c to $9.70 on 2.5m shares, Aquila fell 7c to $3.54 on 957,000 shares on MIN's
announcement.
*Ramsay Healthcare closed up $1.66 to $46.80 on 650,000 shares on its hospital j/v purchase in
France.

*LNG shot up 40c to $1.73 on 14.4m shares, no immediate news.
*Meanwhile "The Age" reports Macquarie Group has cautioned against investing in Hong Kong
companies which are exposed to the political winds of mainland China, following an official warning that
the city's administrative "autonomy" is a privilege that can be removed at any time.
Hong Kong has retained its status as the financial hub of Asia since its handover from Great Britain in
1997, when Chinese leaders committed to retain a system of "one country two systems' for 50 years.
On Tuesday, China's State Council released an unprecedented White Paper that said Hong Kong is just
"one of the local administrative regions' and warns against "outside forces' using the city to interfere in
China's domestic affairs.
"The high degree of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong is subject to the central government's
authorisation," says the paper.

The city is home to more than 80,000 Australians while 550 Australian businesses have a "major
presence" there, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but many are growing uneasy
at the growing reach of Beijing.
Our thought only: Also huge impact on the LME, if Hong Kong becomes "just a local admin region" for
China.

*At 4pm AEST the NikkeiDow futures is down 110 points to 14,950 points, Shanghai CSI physical is
down 1.96 points to 2052.99, Hang Seng futures is up 1 point to 23,107 points, S&P futures is up 1 point
