TRADE in Aquila Resources shares has been halted ahead of yet another announcement related to
takeover interest.
AQUILA is the target of $1.4 billion takeover bid from Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and rail operator
Aurizon, as they look to kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project in Western
Australia.

But last week Mineral Resources bought a near $200 million, 13 per cent stake in Aquila Resources, in a
bid to deal itself into the large-scale iron ore project.
Another purchase of shares looks likely, with shares in Mineral Resources and Aquila halted from trade
on Monday ahead of an announcement from each company regarding "a potential corporate transaction".

Baosteel and Aurizon said late last week they would not be increasing their offer for Aquila as a result of
Mineral Resources' acquisition.
