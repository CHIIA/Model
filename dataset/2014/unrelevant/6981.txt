"Another slow day, closing up about 10"

"Maree" said, "Quite possibly a period of consolidation ahead of the Budget has already kicked in. We may
have another slow day, closing up about 10. Investors are remaining sidelined waiting for confirmation of
where our economy is heading. Meanwhile, we have a massive Asian market into which our LNG supplies
are likely to lead the world and although our mines are slowing down, they are still doing better than
expected. But we seem to react to negative news while disregarding the rest.

"We also seem to be disregarding what is going on in the rest of the world".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 2.5 points to 5489.1 points last evening.

*BBC news reported that in China, there has been a violent attack yesterday at a railway station in
China's western Xinjiang region has killed three and injured 79 others, officials and state media say.

The attackers used explosives and knives at Urumqi's south railway station on Wednesday, officials said.

The local government described it as a "violent terrorist attack" but said the situation was now under
control.

President Xi urged "'decisive actions' against violent terrorist attacks' following the incident, Xinhua news
agency said.

Verifying reports from the region is difficult because the flow of information out of Xinjiang is tightly
controlled.

Xinjiang has seen a series of violent attacks in the past year. Beijing blames the violence on separatists
from the mainly Muslim Uighur minority.

unrest driven by pro-Russian activists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Mr Turchynov said
the goal was now to prevent the unrest spreading to other regions, especially Odessa and Kharkiv. So far
these cities have seen some turbulence, but nothing on the level of what has happened in Donetsk and
Luhansk.

The government's hope is to keep a lid on the situation until the 25 May presidential elections.

* The International Monetary Fund has approved loan assistance to Ukraine in the amount of $17 bln for

massive capital flight of about $US100billion.

*Russia is seen to be already struggling with recession.

Trading points:

*ANZ: Cash profit, dividend exceeds analysts expectations
ANZ has reported interim results - cash profit is up 11% to $3.5 billion, a fully franked interim dividend of
83c has been reported (more to follow).

Analysts expectations: Cash NPAT $3.455 bln/consensus $3.41 bln/div 80c/81c.

High estimate $3.8 bln and a low estimate of $2,86 bln. The median estimate represents a 1.73%
decrease from the last consensus forecast of $3.46 bln.

*A leading broker on February 24 said it expects ANZ's margins to keep falling. It said it thinks the full year
2014 loan loss guidance (down 10/5 year on year to $A1.1 billion or 21 basis points of loans) factors in
additional provisioning for Forge Group. It sees some risks from exposure to the mining sector and Asia.

*Another leading broker said "Look for net interest margin decay from institutional/Asia, Pacific, Europe
and America (APEA) business and an increased emphasis toward returns rather than growth in the APEA
franchise."

Funding costs are at a 5-year low.

*RIO: Sues Vale, other over Simandou
Media services report Rio Tinto has sued Vale SA, Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz and his BSG
Resources Ltd. alleging they conspired to steal mining rights to the world's biggest untapped iron-ore
deposit by bribing officials in Guinea.
Vale used information obtained from Rio during discussions in New York to buy a stake in the Simandou
property in southeast Guinea and secretly passed it on to Steinmetz and BSGR to back their bid to get
the mining rights, Rio said in a complaint filed today in federal court in New York.
Rio, which said it spent 11 years and hundreds of millions of dollars developing mining operations at
Simandou, lost half its interest in the property in 2008, valued in the billions of dollars, when the Guinean
government said it planned to give the stake to BSGR, according to the complaint. Steinmetz and BSGR
bribed Guinean officials, giving $200 million to Mahmoud Thiam, the former mining minister,Rio claimed.
BSGR, known mainly for diamond mining, partnered with Vale because the company had iron mining
experience and resources to develop the mine, Rio claimed.

Page236of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."While BSGR and Steinmetz pursued their illegal bribery campaign in Guinea, Vale's role in the scheme
was to continue to obtain Rio Tinto's highly confidential and proprietary information under false pretenses,
and pass that information on to Steinmetz and BSGR in order to facilitate their efforts to induce officials in
the Guinean government to rescind Rio Tinto's rights."
Thiam, the former mining minister, said in an e-mailed statement today that Rio's claims are false and
"borderline comical." He said Rio poses as facts events that never took place and may be attempting to
divert attention from its unwillingness to develop the property.

"Unfortunately, it's Guinea's economy that will continue to suffer at the hand of corporate bandits," Thiam
wrote.
Rio Tinto is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP. The law firm represented billionaire
Leonard Blavatnik in his lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Commerce Department, the second weakest quartelry reading of the nearly 5 year old economic recovery.
Exports fell at the fastest rate since the recession ended, declining at a 7.6% pace in the first quarter, on
shakey recoveries in Europe and Asia generating poor demand, the Wal Street Journal said. Consumer
spending rose at only 0.4% while total consumer spending rose 3% only slightly below the 4th quarter's

that slowed in the winter to accelerate later in the year.
