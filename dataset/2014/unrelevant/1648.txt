infrastructure: British gas giant BG Group is seeking indicative bids for its Queensland gas pipeline
assets, with four parties likely to bid for the $2.5 billion of infrastructure assets related to its
Queensland Curtis Island liquefied natural gas (QCLNG) project.

BG kicked off the bidding process this week and is seeking offers by late next month, a source close
to the situation told Data Room. The sale has been delayed a couple of times.

Goldman Sachs is believed to be acting for BG on the sale.
The assets for sale, which include a 540km pipeline to carry coal-seam gas from the Surat Basin to
the processing plant on Curtis Island, have drawn strong interest from infrastructure investors both in
Australia and from overseas.
Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Asia’s richest man, Li
Ka-shing, will bid on its own for the BG assets after sealing its $2.4bn takeover of gas distributor
Envestra.

The other three parties are believed to be consortiums of domestic and overseas investors. Industry
Funds Management will bid jointly with Queensland Investment Corporation and Canada’s Enbridge.
Hastings Funds Management has teamed up with Canada’s Borealis and Germany’s Allianz, while
APA Group has been joined by Japan’s Marubeni.
The sale could be valued at $2.5bn, depending on how BG structures the deal and whether it
includes other assets.

BG has been looking to monetise assets and unlock capital to focus on its core explorations globally.
The company sold a 40 per cent part of its QCLNG project to China’s CNOOC for $US1.9bn in 2012
and signed a 20-year supply agreement with Tokyo Gas. But it retains 100 per cent ownership of the
pipeline assets.
A month ago BG said it had agreed to sell its equity interest in a gas pipeline in the North Sea and
associated infrastructure to Antin Infrastructure Partners for up to £562 million ($1.03bn).MAGGIE
