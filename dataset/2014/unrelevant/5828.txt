Resources: Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest has spent $70 million of his own
money buying shares in the company over the past nine months as part of a one-man mission to
boost confidence in the stock amid wilting iron ore prices.
He snapped up another 1.75 million shares in the miner on Monday and Tuesday this week, paying
$6.96m at an average price of $3.97.

In total, Mr Forrest has spent about $68.5m buying Fortescue shares since September last year,
according to seven disclosures he has made to the Australian Securities Exchange in that time.

Fortescue’s share price rose 5 per cent to $4.22 yesterday, meaning Mr Forrest has already made a
paper profit of $400,000 on his latest on-market purchases.

But he is underwater on all of the other shares he has bought in the past nine months. For example,
he forked out $10.99m last October to buy shares at an average price of $5.49 and in March he paid
$4.93m for shares at an average price of $4.93.
Fortescue’s share price has fallen 28 per cent since the start of the year as iron ore prices have
steadily weakened — to as low as $US89 a tonne this week — amid plateauing Chinese demand for
the commodity and an increased supply in the market.
In a further sign of market weakness, Fortescue has been discounting its ore by about 12.5 per cent
as Chinese demand for its lower-quality ore plummets.
Chief executive Nev Power has said Fortescue’s break-even point is an iron ore price of about
$US72, but few analysts expect the price to weaken to that level in the short term.
Mr Forrest’s 33 per cent stake in Fortescue — the Perth-based company he founded in 2003 — was
worth about $4.36 billion last night.

The magnate is cashed up after receiving a half-year dividend cheque from Fortescue of more than
$100m in April.
In recent months he has also agreed to pump $12m into uranium explorer Energy and Minerals
Australia and bought West Australian beef processor Harvey Beef for more than $30m, signalling his
intention to become a key player in Australia’s beef exports to China.Last month, Mr Forrest said he
expected the price of iron ore to remain strong.
