China Official Services PMI rises at fastest pace in six months in May
Reuters reports China's services sector grew at its fastest pace in six months in May as new orders
rebounded, an official survey showed, reinforcing hopes that the Chinese economy may be steadying
after a tumultuous few months.

The official non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) climbed to 55.5 from April's 54.8, the
National Bureau of Statistics said. That is well above the 50-point level that separates an expansion from a
contraction in activity.

In a sign of buoyancy in the sector, new orders rebounded to an eight-month high of 52.7, compared to
April's 50.8. Business expectations also held their ground at a solid 60.7, compared to April's 61.5.

Lack of volatility in markets reminiscent of run up to 2007/08 crisis

*From "The Telegraph" in London, reported in "The Age" today:

A storm alert today from Simon Derrick at the Bank of New York Mellon. He cites three warnings from
leading central bankers, all alarmed by the remarkable disregard for risk in the equity, credit, and currency
markets.

The Bank of England's Deputy Governor Charles Bean says the lack of volatility is "eerily reminiscent" of
the run up to the financial crisis in 2007-2008. Investors are turning a blind eye to a large fact: that central
banks are intent on extricating themselves from QE and emergency policies come what may, and this is
going to be a painful experience.

Italy central bank Governor Ignazio Visco issued a similar warning on Friday: "Volatility on the financial
markets in the advanced economies has subsided to well below the historic norm, reaching levels that in
the past sometimes preceded rapid changes in the orientation of investors."

Page67of266©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In America, Dallas Fed chief Richard Fisher has been warning for several weeks that the decline in the
VIX index measuring volatility is an accident waiting to happen. One almost has the impression that he is
itching to inflict some "two-risk way" into markets to shatter this complacency.

Mr Derrick says dash for yield is all too like the last stage of the carry trade just before Russia and East
Asia blew up in 1998, and again in the summer of 2007 when investors seemed to lose all fear. Both
episodes ended with a bang, at first signalled by a surge in the Japanese yen".
*Our market had already factored in China's better than expected official manufacturing PMI number
announced on Sunday in trading yesterday, while Europe and the US was still closed for the weekend,
with no major news to drive our market higher today.

"Resistance at 5525, support at 5500. Flat day ..given the strong move yesterday"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "Yesterday the move up in our market showed underlying
demand is still strong for high yielding stocks such as the banks and is a positive sign for the strength of
the market. Momentum is still elevated and positive.

"The XJO daily chart is still in a moderate uptrend, although totally different to the US in terms of strength,
but still trending upwards.

"The 20 day moving average is sitting at 5481 which we tested early in the session yesterday. That
remains good support, with the moving average tested and unbroken a good sign yesterday, with the
market closing nearly on its highs.

"5550 is still likely to be resistance for the duration of this week. The next level is around 5530. Support for
the week is probably at the 20 day moving average of 5480. "Momentum in the US is obviously a lot
stronger still and we keep seeing new highs. There was a solid rebound on the Dow from its May lows
which again shows the strength in US equities at the moment. Momentum is showing some signs of
slowing down, but volatility remains very low. The next level of resistance in the US is 16,900 on the Dow.
There will be good support around 16,625.
*The Shanghai market has seen plenty of press with the iron ore price. Surprisingly it has been relatively
stable. I think 2000 remains solid support as it has through April and May. It has struggled to break 2055
and is in more of a consolidation pattern at the moment. The 20 day moving average is starting to trend
upwards. If it breaks 2055 that will be short term bullish. The next big test is 2080.
*Comex copper in US dollar terms is in an uptrend from its March lows. We have seen $2.95/lb as good
support since March. $3.18/lb seems to be resistance, support is now at $3.12/lb. If it does break $3.18 we
could see it back to $3.25/lb.

"For the day, I expect intra day resistance at 5525, support should be at 5500. I expect a pretty flat day
with not much volatility, given the strong move yesterday".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 26 points to 5518.5 last evening.
