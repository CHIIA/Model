2218 GMT - Roc Oil (ROC.AU) may be Fosun International's (0656.HK) first acquisition in oil and gas,
but it's unlikely to be its last, says Macquarie. The Hong Kong-listed company has a market value of
US$8B and cash balances growing to US$5.4B, giving it the firepower to do more deals. Fosun had
secured a 92.6% interest in Roc when its A$0.69/share offer closed, enabling it buy the outstanding
stock via compulsory purchase. "With no major changes to the business planned, we suspect Fosun
will use Roc's operator capability across a number of Asian countries (most notably China and Malaysia)
and its carried forward tax losses in Australia as a springboard for further opportunities," Macquarie says.

16:47 EST - U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether homeowners can cancel their second
mortgages in bankruptcy when their properties aren't even worth the value of the first mortgage. Two
Florida homeowners argued that the liens are valueless, but lenders have fought to keep them, saying
the debt could be repaid as property values rise. Bank of America lawyers said the topic "may be the
single most important unresolved issue in consumer bankruptcy." Lobbying groups for the corporate loan
market and banking industry, including Loan Syndications and Trading Association and American
Bankers Association, plan to fight alongside the bank. (katy.stech@wsj.com; @katystech)
16:13 EST - Ecuador and Venezuela believe one mechanism to boost oil prices is to meet the
production ceiling of 30M barrels per day, Ecuador's minister of non-renewable natural resources Pedro
Merizalde says. Some OPEC members, like Iran and Qatar, and non-OPEC oil producers like Mexico
and Russia agree with this position, according to the minister. "We expect a consensus decision at the
OPEC Nov. 27 meeting. Ecuador will comply with any OPEC decision," Merizalde says. OPEC is facing
the lowest oil prices in at least four years. (mercedes.alvaro@wsj.com)
15:59 EST - Alleged corruption at the Brazilian state-run firm has led to the biggest credit default swap
spreads at the company in more than five years, according to Fitch Solutions. Five-year CDS on
Petrobas widened 21% last week, the widest since early-2009., Fitch says. Petrobras shares were down
6% today after the company said it would miss its 2014 oil production target, and delayed its 3Q
earnings report amid a growing corruption scandal. (william.connors@wsj.com; @wconnors)

15:56 EST - NZD/AUD pushes slightly higher, extending gains after New Zealand's better-than-expected
retail sales data Monday. BNZ strategist Kymberly Martin says with no new Zealand data, attention will
center on the Reserve Bank of Australia's meeting minutes and speech by RBA Governor Stevens,
before turning back domestically to results of a dairy auction. The pair is at 0.9088 from 0.9062 late last
session. Martin puts resistance at 0.9160. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

2033 GMT - AUD/USD has found a near term cap at 0.8800 which should be retested during the days
ahead, Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer says. He says risk events will be the RBA's releases of
its minutes for the Nov. 4 meeting, while Governor Stevens is due to speak in Melbourne later in the
global day. "The Eurozone investor sentiment survey will be watched, as will U.S. PPI and homebuilder
sentiment." The pair is at 0.8712 vs. 0.8784 late Monday in Sydney. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;

15:31 EST - ICE cotton futures falls to a near 5-year low and the outlook is bleak, at least for the near
term. Despite the plunge in prices "many mills are waiting to see if prices drop further before making
large purchases," says the International Cotton Advisory Committee. The Washington D.C.-based group

Page232of253©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.says demand should pick up this year, rising 4.2% to 24.45M bales. But that will not be enough to spin
the world's stockpile of cotton into a deficit. Stockpiles will likely end the 2014-15 season on July 31,
2015 at a record 21.6M bales, ICAC estimates. ICE March cotton ends 0.9% 59.10c/lb.

15:15 EST - A weaker NZD/USD overall saw large buying interest around 0.7920, and "expect dips to be
sought after with the recent upside trend still intact," says ANZ. "It's all about the price action today, with
no NZ data out." The pair is at 0.7917 after reaching 0.7975 overnight. ANZ adds the Global Dairy trade
Auction is the next catalyst for NZD direction. The pair is expected to trade in a range 0.7880 to 0.7950.

14:45 EST - Natural gas futures jump almost 8% as forecasts for winter weather appear on the horizon,
with front-month December rising 32.1 cents to settle at $4.341 a million Btus on the Nymex. Gas
futures have been getting volatile lately, with prices plummeting to $3.56 in late October, climbing almost
$1 through early November, then falling and gaining again. Prices are still shy of the high they set earlier
this month but aren't far away. Analysts are saying this rally may be a bit overdone, but the forecast is
certainly bullish: The trading window through the end of November completely reversed in weekend
updates, turning much colder for much longer than previously expected. (christian.berthelsen@wsj.com)

13:49 EST - Japan's disappointing 3Q growth report has Capital Economics revising its USD/JPY
forecast higher. Firm now sees the pair ending 2015 at 140 from its previous call for 120, citing an
expected widening of the nations' 10-year yield gap in the coming years as the BOJ eases policy. Pair up
0.2% to 116.46. And despite the yen's haven status, CapEcon warns that reputation might be waning.
"Japan's economic fundamentals have deteriorated to the point where many investors are not likely to
see the yen as a 'safe haven' in times of stress," it says. "Even if volatility did increase, it is not clear to
us that the yen would benefit as much this time around." (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)

13:10 EST - Boaz Weinstein suffered a rough October despite the onset of increased volatility that he
has said would be a boon for his fixed-income strategy. Weinstein's Saba Capital Master Fund fell
2.77%, its steepest drop this year, leaving the fund down nearly 7% for 2014 and on track for the worst
annual loss in its 5-plus-year history, according to an investor update viewed by WSJ. As WSJ reported
earlier this year, investors have consistently withdrawn money from Saba for more than a year; the firm
now manages $2.3B, down from $2.6B at midyear. (rob.copeland@wsj.com; @realrobcopeland)

13:02 EST - Monday's proving to be tough day for the vocal contingent of folks who believe ultra-easy
Fed policy is setting the stage of surging inflation. First, the venerable Survey of Professional
Forecasters saw economists cutting their inflation outlooks over the next few years. Now, a new San
Francisco Fed paper warns it's pretty likely inflation won't go over the Fed's 2% target until after 2016.
That's not totally out of line with current Fed forecasts, but the paper also notes the risks of weak inflation
strongly outweigh higher inflation. That means hitting the Fed's 2% price target may be becoming more
elusive and suggests a higher level of uncertainty about 2015 rate hike bets. (michael.derby@wsj.com;
