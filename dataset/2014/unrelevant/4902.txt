0425 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 hits a 3-day high of 5521.8 on broad-based gains as
stronger domestic business confidence and conditions data magnify a recovery led by easing geopolitical
risk. The local bourse is catching up to the S&P 500 after it rose 1.5% in the past two days versus a 0.9%
fall in the S&P/ASX 200. "The ongoing global economic recovery, easy monetary policies and relatively
good balance sheets for major companies means the bias for the market is still higher," says Morgans
investment adviser Christopher Macdonald. "The geopolitical risks are still there, but after a 220 point
retracement, there was room for good news to attract investment. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more
down days later this week." Index last up 1.1% at 5517.2. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

0421 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan's Ministry of Finance sells Y546.7 billion of 1.7% 30-year bonds with the
lowest price of 100.40 yielding 1.679%; higher than market expectations for a lowest price of 100.35.
Daiwa Securities strategist Keiko Onogi says that the auction result was smooth as 30-year bonds looked
cheap compared to 20-year bonds and swaps. Yet concern about demand for JGBs maturing in over 25
years will likely continue though the end of the month as market participants have to digest issuance of
30- and 40-year JGBs greater than what the BOJ will likely offer to buy in the rest of August, she says.
The bid-to-cover ratio improves to 4.06 from 3.12 at the last tender, while the tail is shorter at 0.07 vs.
0.14. The 30-year JGB yield falls on the result; the yield is down one basis point at 1.675%.

0418 GMT [Dow Jones] The latest housing sales data feel heavy, with the Real Estate Institute of New
Zealand reporting that Auckland and Canterbury are dominating while the regions are flat-lining, says
Annette Beacher, head of Asia Pacific Research at TD Securities. The data show the national median
home price eased to NZ$416,000 in July, down NZ$11,250 on the month. "Keep in mind that July is
mid-winter for New Zealand, so the litmus test for the housing market will be the spring September
report, not June-August reports," she says. Home sales peaked well over a year ago, Beacher notes, but
she cautions against concluding that a cooler housing market means the RBNZ has finished its tightening
cycling. "What it implies is that monetary policy doesn't have to enter the restrictive zone to cool housing,
unlike past cycles." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)
0412 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities veer between gains and losses as investors wonder
whether additional stimulus is needed to sustain last month's rally. The Hang Seng Index is down 0.1%
to 24,615.06 at the end of morning trading, while H-shares move in line; the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index falls 0.1% to 10,026.28. "We are growing concerned that China might be closer to the
end of its rally than the beginning and that additional stimulus will be needed to continue the uptrend,"
says CIMB. "However, we are not prepared to fight policy makers, momentum and flows." BlackRock
says valuations still look attractive in Asia as China's economy stabilizes, even if they have not proved
immune to last week's sell-off. "Despite the recent weakness in equities, curiously investors continue to
pursue emerging stocks in Asia: Good relative valuations are helping," the firm says.

complaint about a lack of animal spirits in business, says Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific
Research at TD Securities. Stevens has noted that businesses appeared to "sit around the table waiting
for someone to do something" and he has appeared frustrated that the abundance of liquidity at record
low borrowing rates wasn't sparking risk-taking in the commercial world, she adds. Today's solid rise in
business confidence and conditions says that monetary policy has done enough, and the boost in animal
spirits in this report could be the start of a positive feedback loop, Beacher says. (james.glynn@wsj.com;

0353 GMT [Dow Jones] Shanghai shares are lower midday, as investors take a breather after Monday's
rise, analysts say. The Shanghai Composite Index falls 0.2% to 2219.99, with support tipped at 2200.
"Although the economy is slowly recovering, a broader variety of uncertainties, including the direction of
property policy, debt issues and yuan's outlook, remain," says Hou Yuqi, a fund manager at HSBC
Jintrust Fund Management Co. Financial firms are succumbing to profit-taking after recent gains on
concerns about deteriorating loan quality. New China Life Insurance (601336.SH) slides 0.9% to
CNY24.43, and China Merchants Bank (600036.SH) loses 1.4% to CNY10.93. The Shenzhen
Composite Index is up 0.2% at 1193.63. (amy.li@dowjones.com)

0350 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan economist Ben Jarman is cautious about the improving economic
outlook implied by NAB's improved business survey for July, as it was narrowly concentrated in the
construction sector. The sector is prone to "flighty changes in sentiment," he says, and is also less of a
bellwether for hiring and inflation trends than are, say, services or retail. "For that reason we are cautious
on today's result until the signal of better final demand conditions is corroborated in the official data for
the third quarter," Jarman says. "Of course, surveys are supposed to be leading indicators, but we
struggle to see what could have brought such a change in fortunes in July, and the finer details of the
survey are not particularly instructive on this point." (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

0341 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian house price growth is set to moderate as auction activity growth has
ceased, says Paul Brennan, chief economist at Citigroup. The yearly pace of house price growth has
remained at an elevated pace for longer than expected due to resilience in the pace of house prices in
Melbourne and Sydney. Brennan still expects house price growth to slow in these cities. The government
house price series showed a re-acceleration in price growth with a rise of 1.8% in 2Q, which exceeded
the market consensus of a 1.0% gain and Citi's 1.5% forecast increase. Yearly house price growth still
remains above 10%, Mr. Brennan added.(james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0320 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia business conditions surprisingly jumped to a 4-year high in July,
despite an overvalued Australian dollar, driven by a lift in non-mining, according to a NAB survey. If
sustained, it would be a positive signal that the economy is coping better with the uncompetitive currency
than prior cycles, and is rebalancing, said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS Economics. Evidence in
the NAB report that hiring intentions improved suggest the recent spike in the unemployment rate won't
continue, Haslem adds. This suggests little pressure on the RBA to move rates near-term, so we still
expect them to hold before hiking in Q215, said Haslem. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0306 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/TWD consolidates in quiet trade, but traders say the pair is still likely to
rise slightly due to foreign investor buying. The pair is at 30.003, little changed from 30.000 traded before
the local central bank's suspected intervention Monday, which lifted it to 30.052 at the close of onshore
trading session, traders say. A trader says easing geopolitical concerns are not affecting the USD/TWD.
"Foreign investors' remittance of their stock dividends abroad is likely supporting the USD/TWD," the
trader adds, and tips the pair to trade between 29.990 and 30.020 band for the session. The Taiex is flat.

0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Resilient business confidence has been a bright spot for the Australian economy
after the end of a decadelong mining boom, but even that may not last. "Outside of construction, only
retail is showing especially high confidence," NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster says. "Yet, soft wages
growth, a rising unemployment rate and a decline in June quarter retail sales suggests that this
confidence may be tested ahead." Business confidence climbed for the fourth straight month in July to a
10-month high--rising to 11 index points from 8 points in June, according to NAB's monthly survey.
Business conditions, meanwhile, rose for the second month in a row to a four-and-a-half year high of 8
index points vs 2 points in June. Business confidence may prove vulnerable to worsening unemployment,
which hit a 12-year high last month as mining companies continued to scale back or cancel plans to
expand or construct new mines. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0225 GMT [Dow Jones] OCBC bank thinks the near-term risks for the Australian dollar against its U.S.
counterpart remain tilted south given the still-fragile risk environment, the potential for further USD
strength, the less-than-hawkish implications from the latest Reserve Bank of Australia's meeting and

Page138of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.monetary policy statement, as well as weak Australian labor market readings in July. OCBC bank
recommends selling spot AUD/USD at 0.9271. The bank targets a move to 0.9115, and suggests placing
a stop-buy order at 0.9350 to limit losses. Spot AUD/USD was last at 0.9266. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
