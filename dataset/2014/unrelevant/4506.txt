Poseidon Nickelnbsp;(ASX:POS) has revised the Indicated and Inferred Resource at the Mt
Windarra Nickel Project in Western Australia to the JORC 2012 standard.

This is now estimated at 4.36 million tonnes at 1.64% Nickel for 71500 tonnes of contained Nickel
metal using 0.9% cut-off grade.
Shares in the company should trade higher today on the news.
In October Poseidon signed a Nickel off take deal with mining majornbsp;BHP
Billitonnbsp;(ASX:BHP) for the Mt Windarra project with first ore deliveries due no later than
February 2015.
The resource update for Mt Windarra follows on the company delivering a maiden Probable Ore
Reserve of 3.37 million tonnes at 0.63% Nickel for 21500 tonnes contained Nickel for its recently
acquired Black Swan project.

The revised estimate for Mt Windarra was carried out by Optiro Pty Ltd which had completed the
majority of the prior resource estimates.

Mt Windarra Resource Assumptions and Methodology

The new JORC 2012 estimate used a 166 hole database and mineralisation envelopes constructed
by Poseidon.

Optiro ensured that all the mineralisation wireframes were snapped to the drillholes and that all of
the mineralisation was captured. It also used information used in previous studies.

Recent drilling undertaken by Poseidon has been analysed for a full suite of multielements providing
Optiro with more data for estimation.

Mt Windarra Offtake
Under the Nickel off take deal withnbsp;BHP Billitonore from Mt Windarra will be toll treated at
BHP's Nickel West Leinster concentrator.nbsp;nbsp;
Nickel West will purchase all concentrate from the concentrator at an agreed rate for an initial 2
years and renewable for a further 2 years.
The Ore Tolling and Concentrate Agreement is for an initial period of 2 years ending in February
2017 with first ore deliveries due no later than February 2015 subject to satisfaction of conditions
precedent including the parties obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.nbsp;

Nickel West has the option to extend the contract term by 1 or 2 contract years.nbsp; The contract
is for a minimum quantity of 350000 tonnes of ore per annum and a maximum of 500000 tonnes
which can be extended to 700000 tonnes by mutual agreement.

against payments by Nickel West for the concentrate produced.nbsp;
The processing of ore at Leinster reduces the costs of commencing operations at Windarra to
approximately $11 million plus working capital from the previously reported figure of $290
million.nbsp;
The company is well progressed on funding options to support the commencement of ore
deliveries in the timescales envisaged.

Analysis

The updated JORC 2012 Resource for Mt Windarra provides greater certainty fornbsp;Poseidon
Nickelnbsp;as it prepares to begin ore deliveries in February 2015.
The company is already funded for the estimated $11 million required to commence operations
having recently raised $30 million through an oversubscribed placement priced at $0.18 per share.

Proactive Investors maintains its 12 month price target fornbsp;Poseidon Nickelnbsp;of $0.40 -
$0.52.
