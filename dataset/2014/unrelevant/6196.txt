Canadian uranium miner Cameco has moved to increase its landholding near its
“resource-challenged” Kintyre project, announcing a deal with fellow Canadian Mega Uranium.

In a deal which Cameco Australia managing director Brian Reilly described as a necessary step to
boost Kintyre’s chances of development, Cameco will earn an initial 51 per cent stake in the land by
funding exploration worth $2 million. Although the exploration deal is small potatoes for the
billion-dollar uranium miner, it signals Cameco’s long-term commitment to uranium mining in WA
despite the severe headwinds facing the sector.

The deal, which was originally flagged in July, also triggers Mega’s gradual exit from the WA scene,
after the Canadian divested its flagship Lake Maitland project to Toro Energy in August.
Speaking to WestBusiness yesterday, Mr Reilly said the 55 million-pound resource at Kintyre, of
which only 40 million pounds was “minable”, needed to increase.

“Our objective is pretty clear, we need to find more pounds,” Mr Reilly said. “The short-term market is
something we can’t control, but we can control building up our resource.”
Cameco, the world’s biggest publicly listed uranium com- pany, bought Kintyre from Rio Tinto for
$516 million in a 70-30 venture with Japan’s Mitsubishi Development in 2008. The com- pany
indicated in 2012 a uranium price of at least $US60 a pound to $US70/lb would be needed to push it
into production.
The uranium price was yesterday anchored at an historic low of $35.60/lb.

Mr Reilly said the price threshold remained. Commenting on the long-term outlook for the sector, he
said the company was encouraged by the merger and acquisition activity, such as the Toro and
Mega deal.
“And with Japan coming back on line and the (reactor) builds in China, we’re encouraged in a broader
macro sense,” he said.
Energy Resources of Australia, the uranium producer controlled by Rio Tinto, yesterday said it
expected prices to start recovering in 2015 or 2016 as demand in Japan and China increased.

This is backed up by predictions of almost 200 analysts on Bloomberg saying the median price for
uranium next year will come in at $US57/lb.
