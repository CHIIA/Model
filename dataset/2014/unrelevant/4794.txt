Envestra managing director Ian Little intends staying on at the helm of the gas distributor after its
$2.37 billion takeover by Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Group.

Mr Little was speaking to investors after reporting a record normalised profit in what is set to be
Envestra's last results as a publicly traded company. Net profit for the year to June 30 jumped
42 per cent to $153 million, despite a 5 per cent drop in distributed gas volumes due to warmer
weather.

The figure modestly beat Envestra's own guidance of "about $150 million" in June and was well
ahead of its forecast 12 months ago of about $140 million.

Envestra put the improvement down to tariff increases across its South Australian and Queensland
networks, as endorsed by the energy regulator.

That was only partly offset by the drop in gas volumes, a trend which has been dramatically
reversed in the first six weeks of this financial year because of the cold snap across southern
Australia, with revenues almost $3 million ahead of expectations in July alone.
Paul Johnston of RBC Capital Markets said the result would see the company go out "on a high".

The July performance suggested other utilities would also have benefited from the low
temperatures, he said.

As of Wednesday, Cheung Kong had raised its interest in Envestra to 87.75 per cent, just shy of the
90 per cent required for compulsory acquisition.

Acceptances have accelerated since APA Group dropped out of the running, instead selling its
33 per cent stake into the $1.32-a-share offer.

Aside from upcoming changes to the board, it would be "business as usual" under Cheung Kong's
ownership, Mr Little said. Envestra already declared its final dividend back in July, of 3.5¢ a security,
up from 3.2¢ a year earlier.
