Moody's Investors Service says that rising natural gas prices in eastern Australia will not materially affect
the credit quality of most Moody's-rated Australian corporates over the next two to three years, as their
exposure to the market price of gas is mangeable.

"Currently, most Australian corporates have low-cost legacy gas contracts and/or small gas exposures, but
we expect prices to rise to around AUD8 to AUD10 per gigajoule by 2018 from the current AUD4 to
AUD6," says Spencer Ng, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst. Such a trend will not materially
weaken the affected issuers' credit profile beyond our rating expectation.

"The company more affected by the higher gas prices is industrial gas user, Incitec Pivot Limited (rated
Baa3/stable) , which is likely to see its earnings negatively impacted by around AUD50 million
(approximately 7% of FY13 EBITDA), because natural gas is a key ingredient in its fertilizer manufacturing
process. Moreover, one of its key gas supply contract expires in December 2014," adds Ng.

"But even in the case of Incitec, the expected fall in its earnings over the next two years will not weaken its
credit quality such as to prompt us to take a negative rating action."

Moody's analysis is contained in its just-released report titled "Rising Natural Gas Prices in Eastern
Australia Will Hurt Manufacturers, Help Gas Producers," and is co-authored by Ng and Kirsten Lee, an
Associate Analyst.

Moody's report says natural gas prices in eastern Australia will likely rise over the next five years, as
demand for gas increases faster than supply.

"Natural gas consumption along Australia's east coast will increase substantially as liquefied natural gas
export facilities in Queensland come online gradually over the next two years," says Ng.
"While dedicated coal seam gas developments will be the primary source of fuel gas, we believe
supplementary gas supply will be required from domestic gas fields," adds Ng.

"The rising demand without a corresponding increase in supply will be a key contributor to the expected
increase in prices. Liquid natural gas sales contracts linked to oil prices will also push up gas prices."
Moody's report named east coast gas producers, Origin Energy Limited (Baa2 stable) and BHP Billiton
Limited (A1 stable), as beneficiaries of the price increases, saying the two companies -- which own
domestic gas fields -- will see their EBITDA increase modestly over time.
As for mining companies, the report says most Moody's-rated mining companies are unaffected by the
higher natural gas prices along Australia's east coast region because the majority of Moody's-rated
operate in western Australia, which has an independent gas market.
For mining companies that operate on the east coast, Moody's report says their exposure to the higher
prices will depend on their reliance on gas to meet their energy needs. For instance, Newcrest Mining
Ltd's (Baa3 negative) exposure is limited because it primarily sources its energy needs from electricity
rather than gas.
