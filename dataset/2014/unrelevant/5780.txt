Moody's Investors Service says that its stable outlook for the Australian infrastructure sector in 2015 is
underpinned by an overall stable and supportive domestic economy.

However, pressure is growing in some sectors. Overall, key downside risks include reduced demand for
Australia's resources, which will exacerbate the downturn in the mining industry, with knock-on effects on
other sectors.

Moody's conclusions were contained in a just-released report titled, "2015 Outlook -- Australian
Infrastructure." The report was authored by Mary Anne Low, a Moody's Analyst, Arnon Musiker, a Moody's
Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, and Spencer Ng, a Moody's Vice President Senior Analyst.

According to Moody's, refinancing risk in the infrastructure sector is mitigated by the continued appetite for
new issuances, a good liquidity profile overall for the sector, and a proactive approach by most issuers to
refinance well ahead of maturity dates.

The application of the updated regulatory framework for regulated network utilities since late 2012 has
been broadly in line with Moody's expectation, underpinning the stable outlook.

As for the airport industry, fundamentals remain favorable, and outlook for the sector is stable, despite
Moody's expectation of a moderation in domestic passenger growth across the Australian network, due to
greater discipline in the airlines' management of capacities, and Moody's expectation of a slowdown in
mining-related traffic.

The toll road sector continues to benefit from the essential function of toll roads as urban commuter routes
and proven traffic histories. Moody's says the high growth in traffic on certain roads is increasing the
financial headroom within respective ratings.
Ratings in the coal logistics sector are supported by take-or-pay contracts, many with counterparties
owned by investment-grade mining houses.

As for public-private partnerships, their credit profile is supported by low cash-flow volatility, the credit
strength of government offtakers, and the solid operating performance of experienced and able facilities
management providers.
