Japan household spending up, jobless rate rises, retail sales fall in June

Reuters reports Japan's household spending rose 1.5% in June from the previous month in seasonally
adjusted terms, falling short of economists' median estimate of a 2.2% increase - reversing the
contractions seen in April and May. In May, household spending fell 3.1% from the previous month. In
April, household spending tumbled 13.3% as the sales tax hike went into effect.

On an annual basis, Japanese household spending fell 3.0% in June from a year ago, less than the
median market forecast for a 3.8% annual decline and well below the 8.0% decline in the year to June.

Japan's retail sales fell 0.6% in June from a year ago, slightly more than the median estimate for a 0.5%
annual decline and faster than a 0.4% decline in the year to May. The pace of decline was slower
compared with 1997 when the sales tax was last raised. The government raised the national sales tax to
8% from 5% on April 1 to pay for rising welfare costs.

Japan's jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 3.7% in June from 3.5% in May, but labour shortages in
construction and retail suggest the jobless rate is not likely to rise sharply.

The jobs-to-applicants ratio rose to 1.10 in June from 1.09 in the previous month, data from the labour
ministry showed on Tuesday, matching a high last seen in June 1992.

"Down another six as people watch and wait"

Page91of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Bernborough" said he expects the market to be line ball again today. As to whether up or down a few, he
said, "I suggest you toss a coin. But a bit of weakness may continue today - I'll call it down another six as
people continue to watch and wait".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 6.1 points to 5577.4 last evening.

ECO NEWS

*The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment showed a 1.9% increase, from 93.2 in
June to 94.9 in July. The rise came in below expectations, and revealed continuing weakness in
consumers' labour market expectations and the five-year economic outlook.

Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the expected recovery after a sharp drop in May had failed to
materialise.

However, it was not all bad news: family finances appear to be improving, with a 1.9% rise in a sub-index
that tracks household finances compared with a year ago. Sentiment about family finances looking
forward a year also recouped some of the losses sustained after the budget.

Supporting the dollar is ongoing speculation the Reserve Bank could lift interest rates early next year,
amid optimism for a lift in exports as a series of gas export projects in Queensland start up during 2015.

*The Housing Industry Association new home sales report, based on a survey of Australia's largest
volume builders showed an increase of 1.2% in the month of June 2014, and a rise of 2% in the June
quarter. Sales of multi units drove the monthly result, up 15.9%. Detached house sales fell 1% in June.

Detached house sales increased by 2.6% in the June quarter despite falling in the ifnal month, HIA Chief
Economist Dr Harley Dale said in the report.

NEWS OF THE DAY

Western Australia likely to beat official forecasts for wheat output, 2014/15

Page92of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Reuters reports Australia's largest grain producing state Western Australia is likely to beat official
forecasts for wheat output in the 2014/15 season by about 1 million tonnes, or 12 percent, wheat exporter
CBH Group said on Tuesday.
The state's wheat crop is expected to hit 9.4 million tonnes out of total grain production of 15.4 million
tonnes, CBH Group's manager for marketing and trading Jason Craig told reporters on the sidelines of a
grains conference.

The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) last month
forecast Western Australian wheat production at 8.4 million tonnes, down from a bumper harvest of 10.5
million tonnes in the 2013/14 season.

An increase in Western Australian wheat production would supplement national production, already seen
under pressure from dry weather across Australia's east coast.

The state typically accounts for more than a third of Australia's wheat output.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS

*ALQ: Min sector still faces challenging conditions/int to end Sep down 26.5%

ALS Ltd chairman Mrs Nerolie Withnall and managing director Greg Kilmister addressed the AGM.
The chairman undertook some major acquisitions including the acquisition of Reservoir Group in August
2013, an oil and gas services group with an enterprise value of $A608 million, the Reliance Technical
Services, a consumer products testing group, Oil Check, that undertakes equipment lubricant analysis
and Advanced Inspection Technologies that undertakes asset care.
The company also raised $A242 million from a 1 for 11 renounceable rights issue in August 2013 and
$A322 million in long term debt in the US private placement market in September 2013.

Of the 12,000 ALS employees globally, 2/3rds are employed outside of Australia with 40% female
employees.

The chairman also referred to the retirement in 2015 of ray Hill and Bruce Brown, while Grant Murdoch
and John Mulcahy are up for election at the AGM.

Guidance

For the half year ended September 30 2014 underlying net profit after tax will be approximately $74
million, 26.5% below the $100.7 million achieved in the first half of last year.
The chairman said the minerals division and the geochemical business in particular continues to face
very challenging market conditions. While pricing for ALQ's services remains stable, geochemical sample
flows in the June quarter are down 27% on the pcp, with Canada particularly challenging.
The September quarter is looking strong across all ALS's Oil and Gas business streams.

The Life Sciences Division is expected to perform slightly ahead of the first half year. The Industrial
Division's June year to date revenue and EBIT are up 20% and 44% respectively on the same period last
year, mainly on the back of the Asset Care business.

The strong $A is also impacting.

Market Cap $3b.

ALQ down 52 cents to $7.50

Pty Ltd (AMIR), a niche offshore energy underwriting agency. AMIR underwrites in excess of $10 million
premium annually.

Page93of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The acquisitions are expected to add approximately 2.5% to earnings per share for 2015 after funding
costs. The total completion payments paid of $7.6 million have been funded from cash held.

The final payment for Nexus will be determined based on results for 2016.

Market Cap $585m

*FSF: Milk prices fall on inc prod, lower demand/f/casts higher profit, div
Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd reduced its forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2014/15 season from
$NZ7 to $NZ6 per kgMS and announced an estimated dividend range of 20/25NZ c pere share,
amounting to a forecast cash payout of $NZ6.20/6.25 for the current season.
Chairman John Wilson said the lower forecast Farmgate Milk Price reflects strong production globally, a
build up of inventory in China and falling demand in some emerging markets in response to high dairy
commodity prices. Also the New Zealand dollar has remained strong.
Milk collection across New Zealand last season rose 8.3% tio 1,584 mln kgMs.

CEO Theo Spierings said during the first half reduced cost of goods is expected to have a positive impact
on returns. "We continue driving our V3 strategy throughout the previous season and that is why we can
support an increased estimated dividend range for the 2014/15 financial year". Annual results will be
announced on September 24.

*QBE: Lowers interim forecast well below analysts current forecasts

Page94of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.QBE Insurance Group Ltd announced while it expects to report its interim result on August 19, it expects
the result to differ from consensus expectations.
The first half result has been impacted by a claims reserve strengthening of around $170 million in Latin
America, the majority of which relates to QBE's Argentine workers' compensation business, higher than
expected large individual risk claims which contributed to a large individual risk and catastrophe claims
charge of around 10% of net earned premium and an adverse discount rate impact of around $120
million excluding Argentina.
As a consequence the Group's combined operating ratio for the first half is now expected to be 96/97% vs
consensus expectations of around 93% and the Group insurance profit margin for the first half is now
likely to be 76/8% vs consensus expectations of around 10%.

QBE's global portfolio is otherwise performing broadly in line with internal plans. Net profit after tax for the
first half is now expected to be around $390 million.

Analysts current NPAT expectations range from $US475 mln to $US535.8 mln.

*GTG: Encouraging early results from Malolos-1
Gas2Grid Ltd advised the Malolos-1 well operations, onshore Cebu Island in the Philippines are
continuing with a daily cycle of wellhead pressure buildup followed by gas flaring and wellhead pressure
reduction which has been associated with some oil production.

The well has been shut in overnight over the past few weeks resulting in the wellhead pressure building up
to between 100-220 psi. The pressure buildup is associated with an increase in oil and natural gas in the
tubing. Last Thursday morning the well produced 3.75 bbls oil in one hour under natural pressure when
the well was first opened with an associated overnight wellhead pressure build up of 128 psi.
The recent wellhead pressure increase and minor oil production provides encouragement for the

*MCR: NPAT for yr $1.5/2 mln vs loss last yr/cash costs in 2015 may rise

Mincor Resources Ltd in highlights for the June quarter said production was strong at 2,396 tonnes of
nickel in ore at a cash cost of $A5.12/lb payable nickel.

For the full year , production was 10,219 tonnes at a cash cost of $4.96/lb payable nickel, substantially
outperforming guidance.
Estimated full year operating surplus is $40.15 million before capital and near mine exploration costs of
$33.71 million.

Ramped up exploration drilling was highly successful at Mariners and Miitel Mines, with positive
implications fort he ore reserves and mine life of both operations.

Page99of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Drill intersections at Miitel include estimated true widths of 8.8m at 3.12% Ni and 3m at 4.97% Ni,
representing significant southward extensions to the N30 ore body.

There is a potential new exploration discovery at the emerging Voyce Prospect, just south of the Mariners
Mine, with high grade nickel intersections confirming the presence of a discrete, strongly mineralised
channel structure. Drill intersections include estimated true widths of 5.6m at 6.3% Ni and 3.4m at 7.06%
Ni.
After all capital and development, underground drilling expenditure and acquisition of new equipment,
Mincor had cash at bank of $50.65 million vs $51.37 million at end March qtr.

2014 NPAT guidance
Mincor estimates the company made a net profit after tax for the full year 2014 of between $1.5/2 million
vs a loss of $22.45 million last year.

Outlook for 2015

Despite the closure of Otter Juan and McMahon, Mincor's production target remains unchanged for 2015
from the previous year at approximately 8,500 tonnes of nickel in ore, give or take a few.

Due to a lower overall budgeted grade from the previous year as well as recent substantial increases in
power costs, severe pressure is expected on cash costs through 2014/15. Mincor's cost target at $5.30/lb
may be hard to achieve.

*TRY: Open cut mine at Karouni in prod first half 2015, 3 yr + at AISC $602/oz

Troy Resources Ltd advised a study of measured and indicated resources mineable by open cut at Troy's
100% owned Karouni project in Guyana following on from the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA)
and JORC Scoping Study, that looked at both open cut and underground mining, as announced on
January 21.
On April 28 the company had announced it intended to bring production forward to the first half of
calendar 2015.

Considering only resources that can be mined by open cut, resources within the open pits are either
measured (82%) or indicated (18%) vs indicated (49%) and inferred (51%) in the PEA.
Assuming a gold price for the base case of $US1250/oz, the study envisages 3 year open pit mine life
with annual average gold production of 101,000 ozs and production in the first 12 months of 104,400 ozs
via a combination of two open cut mines feeding a convention carbon in leach gold plant with a nominal
capacity of 1Mtpa. The life of mine all in cash cost is envisaged at $602/oz, after tax payback of 1.2 years,
after tax NPV at 6% of $72 million, after tax IRR of 50.2%.

Management is confident it will continue to add to the resource inventory. (Jul 28)
