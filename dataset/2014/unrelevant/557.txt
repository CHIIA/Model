challenge of October's highs.

"The decline here in Oz simply remains too lethargic at present to be sinister in nature.

*KNL: MOU to combine its graphite project with Richland's plant in Tanzania

Kibaran Resources Ltd announced it has signed a non binding MOU to consolidate its Merelani-Arusha
Graphite project with the Richland group's graphite assets in Tanzania following the recent signing of a
binding off take agreement for Kibaran's Epanko Graphite.
The objective is to combine the graphite mineral rights and assets which include TanzaniteOne Mining
Ltd's graphite processing plant, with the goal of recommencing graphite production. A j/v would provide
Kibaran with a second source of graphite in Tanzania and a clear strategy to expand the company's
future graphite production.

Richland owns the historic Merelani Graphite Mine plant built with a namepalte capacity of 15,000 tpa.
TanzaniteOnemining has in place a processing plant and infrastructure including tailing storage facility,
power, water, administration facilities, site camp and services on a commercial basis.

Kibaran has a 90 day exclusive due diligence period to evaluate the processing plant and the cost of
refurbishment to return it to operational status for graphite production. The graphite plant was closed in the
late 1990s due to a change in focus to the production of Tanzanite.

Market Cap $11.6m.
