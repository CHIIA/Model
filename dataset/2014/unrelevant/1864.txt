0326 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian 2Q construction data provide a reminder of the large and opposing
forces that are at work on the economy, says Shane Lee, economist at CIMB. The central bank's record
low rates setting "is clearly gaining traction with the housing sector" with the construction report showing
residential construction work done rose by 2.2% in the quarter following the strong 7.3% gain in the first
quarter. However, the downturn in engineering construction now has considerable momentum, Lee
added. The central bank "would be pleased that residential construction is stepping up as intended," he
added. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0322 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian junk bond trading is being stirred up by Chinese property developers'
upbeat earnings, said Lucror Analytics. Stripping out Guangzhou R&F (2777.HK), which reported
disappointing first-half results, most real estate companies have posted solid profits and excited
investors. Lucror recommends buying Agile Property's (3383.HK) 5-year bond, as it released "decent"
results in light of higher revenues and sales despite a weak market backdrop. Its recommendation for
Evergrande's (3333.HK) bonds is "hold". While the company has strong revenue growth, the financial
profile has weakened with a substantial increase in short term debt. Elsewhere in the region, "the tone
was constructive with Chinese industrial, Indonesian, and Indian names well traded."

0314 GMT [Dow Jones] A 1.2% fall in the value of Australian construction work done in the second
quarter compared with the first has put a dent in expectations for GDP growth forecasts. Adam Boyton,
chief economist at Deutsche Bank said there are now downside risks to his call for GDP growth of just
0.5% in the quarter, to be reported in a week's time. The main downside concern was a big fall in private
engineering construction, where Boyton had expected a gain. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0308 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is nearly flat midday, up just 4.73 points at 15525.95 as the dollar
rebound begins to soften (USD/JPY 104.02). "In the absence of overall trading cues, investors are
focusing on individual motives to buy and sell," says an equity trading director at a European brokerage.
General contractors continue to gain, following a sharp Tuesday sector rally on the back of a Nomura
Securities upgrade on Kajima (1812.TO). Wednesday, the group is benefiting from individual investor
buying on hopes for next month's maglev bullet train job construction kick-off. Kajima is up 2.3% at Y538.
Marine shippers are also higher, with Kawasaki Kisen (9107.TO) up 3.7% at Y252 following a Nikkei
report that it will seek to more than double its ROE to 10%. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0306 GMT [Dow Jones] The Reserve Bank of Australia's desire for a lower Australian dollar is not
surprising, says Su-Lin Ong, Head of Strategy at RBC Capital Markets, Australia. "The alternative hints at
lower national income and living standards," she adds. Lost external competitiveness resulting from the
high currency, which is 20% above its long term average, means wages must fall to compensate, she
said. The environment supports Ong's expectation of falling national income, sub par consumption, and a
lower-for-longer central bank narrative regarding interest rates. The risk is that rigidities in the labor

Page190of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.market prevent meaningful competitiveness gains, pushing the unemployment rate higher, she added.
"That would keep the RBA in play," Ong said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0259 GMT [Dow Jones] The spot USD/CNY slipped to a four-day low of 6.1471 this morning from 6.1523
late Tuesday after the People's Bank of China set the dollar/yuan central parity rate at 6.1658, slightly
lower than Tuesday's 6.1663. The drop came even as the euro tumbled to an 11-and-a-half month low of
1.3153 against the greenback. Further downside support may be encountered at 6.1459 (lower 20-day
one-standard deviation Bollinger Band), then at 6.1366 (Aug. 19 low). Resistance is at 6.1570 (middle
20-day Bollinger Band), then at 6.1616 (Friday's high). Spot USD/CNY is at 6.1491; 1-month USD/CNY
NDF at 6.1690. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0239 GMT [Dow Jones] Korean equities look attractive compared with Korean 5-year treasury bonds
now that interest rates seem poised to head higher, says Barclays. "The yield gap between Korea
equities and the government Treasury bond yield, and also between the Korea yield gap and EM yield
gap and DM yield gap, imply too much risk premium in Korea equities," the bank says. Government
stimulus measures and a one-off rate cut by the Bank of Korea this month should encourage rotation
from bonds into stocks, the bank adds. "The recently announced tax reduction for dividend income (from
14% to 9% for minor shareholders) and the stimulus for dividend payout should attract more attention to
equities." Barclays adds Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance (000810.SE) and LG Chem (051910.SE) to
preferred stocks, while cutting Dongbu Insurance (005830.SE) and LG Display (034220.SE). Korea's
KOSPI gains 0.6% to 2,079.96.(gregor.hunter@wsj.com; Twitter: @gregorhunter)

0237 GMT [Dow Jones] The yuan rises tracking a stronger daily yuan fixing rate set by the PBOC and
ignoring the dollar's broad gains overnight. The yuan is at 6.1485 to a dollar compared with 6.1523 at
Tuesday's close. The central parity is set at 6.1658 compared with 6.1663 Tuesday. "I don't quite
understand the yuan's strength today with more local media reports pointing to the weakness in the
fragile economic recovery. It's probably just tracking the gains in the offshore yuan," a Shanghai-based
foreign bank trader says. The USD/CNH, or offshore USD/CNY, was at 6.1480 from 6.1536 late Tuesday
in Hong Kong. Offshore, one-year USD/CNY NDFs are down at 6.2225/6.2249 from 6.2270/6.2310 late
Tuesday. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0219 GMT [Dow Jones] South Korea's exports is likely to have declined in August following a solid gain
the previous month, says Nomura economist Kwon Young-sun. He expects exports to have fallen 1.8%
in August. Exports in July grew a faster-than-expected 5.7% from a year earlier. Kwon attributes the
country's expected weak trade data to fewer work days, less car production due to summer vacations
and the weakening euro and yen. The trade ministry is due to release the August exports data on Sept 1.

0216 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Agricole says the yuan may fall below technical support at the 200-day
moving average owing to continued negative local news about the banking sector. "There is more noise
about weak lending in August which would mean the second-straight month of poor credit expansion,"
Credit Agricole says. This is bad for third-quarter growth--government stimulus is directed mainly through
infrastructure spending which is paid for by lending. It sees the currency as an outperformer in the
second half and a safe haven at a time of a strong U.S. dollar and rising U.S. Treasury yields--but a
further tactical retreat is increasingly likely. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0211 GMT [Dow Jones] BMD CPO is likely to find its feet in Wednesday's trade with prices supported at
the MYR1,989-MYR1,996/ton level, says a broker in Kuala Lumpur who adds that bargain-hunting and
short-covering may drive prices to test the MYR2,034-MYR2,046/ton resistance. An improvement in
soyoil price also boosts palm-oil. Benchmark November BMD CPO closed 0.7% lower at MYR2,015/ton
Tuesday. October CBOT soyoil is 14 cents higher at 33.19 cents/lb in electronic trade.

0209 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are slightly higher with telecom, media and technology companies
rebounding on bargain hunting following Tuesday's losses. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 0.2% at
2211.36 after a two-session 1.5% drop. Analysts tip the index to trade in a 2200-2250 band. "The market
is unlikely to gain much as there is no good news about economy," says Jacky Zhang, an investment
adviser at BOC International (China). Defense stocks are active on hopes of SOE reforms with
state-controlled AVIC Aero-Engine Controls (000738.SZ) hitting its 10% daily upside limit at CNY14.81.
Among TMT sectors, China National Software & Service (600536.SH) adds 4.2% to CNY27.29. The
Shenzhen Composite Index is up 0.4% at 1207.29. (amy.li@dowjones.com)
