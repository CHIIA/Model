3 Oct 2014 01:48 ET Press Release: S&PBulletin: BHP, Fortescue Rtgs Unaffected By Revised Prices

The following is a press release from
Standard & Poor's:
MELBOURNE (Standard & Poor's) Oct. 3, 2014--Standard & Poor's Ratings
Services
said today that its ratings on Australian mining companies BHP Billiton Ltd.
(A+/Stable/A-1) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (BB+/Stable/--) are
unaffected
following its revised assumptions for benchmark iron ore prices.
On Oct. 2, 2014, Standard & Poor's lowered its assumptions for benchmark
ironore prices (based on 62% iron [Fe] content including costs and freight
[CFR]
to China) by about 10% to US$85 per ton for the rest of 2014, and for 2015
and
2016 (see article titled, "Standard & Poor's Updates Its 2014-2016 Metals
Price Assumptions," published Oct. 2, 2014). We previously assumed benchmark
iron ore prices of US$95 per ton.
The lower iron ore prices would likely cause BHP Billion's credit metrics to
be weaker in the year ending June 30, 2015. However, we believe the company
has strong financial flexibility to mitigate further falls in prices. BHP
Billiton's product mix compares favorably with its mining peers' due to the
presence of sizable petroleum assets in its portfolio. Petroleum provides
good
product diversity to the group as it is less correlated to movements in
steel
demand, compared to iron ore, coking coal, and manganese. However, in our
opinion, the lower commodity prices will reduce the buffer in the rating,
and
BHP Billiton's scope for shareholder-friendly initiatives or the company's
ability to debt-fund more aggressive growth.
We also expect a material impact on Fortescue's margin and earnings from
lower
iron ore prices. Nevertheless, we believe Fortescue's credit metrics will
remain at levels commensurate with the 'BB+' rating under our revised price

Page255of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.assumption. We expect its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt to be
comfortably more than 20% and adjusted debt to EBITDA to be lower than 3x in
fiscal 2015. In our view, the company's efforts to prepay debt and the
successful completion of the 155 million metric ton expansion have
significantly improved its cost position and ability to weather price
volatility. The company's costs, including C1, royalty, and freight costs to
China were about US$50 per wet metric ton in June 2014. Nonetheless, if
benchmark iron ore prices were to sustain well below US$80 per ton, it would
increase downward rating pressure on Fortescue. Compared to a diversified
miner, Fortescue has less financial flexibility and is more sensitive to
ironore price movements.
On the other hand, our revised price assumptions have resulted in the
lowering
of the ratings on Australia-based Atlas Iron Ltd. to 'B', from 'B+'. The
outlook is stable. (See research update titled, "Ratings On Atlas Iron Ltd.
Lowered To 'B' On Prospect Of Weak Cash Flows; Outlook Stable", published
