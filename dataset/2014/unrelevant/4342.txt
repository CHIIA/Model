Commentary
Overview for the six months ended 31 December 2013
Established 44 years ago, Italtile is South Africa's longest-standing and
leading franchisor and retailer of local and
imported tiles, sanitaryware, bathware, laminated wooden flooring and other
related home-finishing products. The
Group's brand portfolio comprises Italtile Retail, CTM and TopT and is
represented locally by a national network of 98 stores
with a further 16 stores situated in the rest of Africa. The brand offering
targets homeowners in the LSM categories 3 to 10.
Italtile's retail operation is underpinned by a strategic property
investment portfolio and vertically integrated
supply chain.
Trading environment
In the context of subdued economic growth and intensified pressure on
consumer disposable income, participants in the
building and construction industry were compelled to deliver optimal
performances to retain and gain market share.
The renovations sector continued to experience greater activity than the new
build sector, but generally, growth in
these markets remained muted. Consumers in the middle income segment were
particularly price sensitive, whereas
entry-level and premium-end customers demonstrated greater resilience.
Financial highlights - continuing operations
Despite the testing trading conditions experienced, the Group delivered
sound results for the six months under review.
During the reporting period the Group disposed of the following non-core
businesses:
- The eight store CTM retail operation in Australia via a facilitated
management buyout;

Page304of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.- Allmuss Properties Zambia Limited - a property holding company; and
- Cladding Finance Proprietary Limited - a niche provider of outsourced
debtors' solutions.
Accordingly, the summarised financial information presented below refers to
continuing operations only.
- System-wide turnover grew 15% to R2,30 billion (2012: R2,00 billion).
- Revenue from Group-owned stores and entities increased 31% to R1,37
billion (2012: R1,05 billion), significantly

quality and price) continued to find favour with discerning,

impacted by the conversion and contribution of nine previously franchised
period, and the opening of one new CTM.
Excluding the contribution from these ten stores, turnover from comparable
Group-owned stores and entities increased
by 15%.
- Reported trading profit rose 22% to R379 million (2012: R311 million). The
Group's achieved gross margins remained
relatively constant due to containment of sales related costs, improvement
in the sales mix, and despite cost pressures
in the supply chain which were largely absorbed to support price
competitiveness of the retail operations. Average
selling prices were inflation-linked.
- Basic earnings per share ("EPS") increased 19% to 28,6 cents per share
(2012: 23,9 cents), while headline earnings
per share ("HEPS") grew 16% to 28,0 cents per share (2012: 24,0 cents).
HEPS have been adjusted for the post-taxation
impact of the following once-off events:
* Profit of R2,4 million achieved on the sale of a property in South
Africa; and
* Profit of R4,4 million achieved on the sale of Allmuss Properties Zambia
Limited (referred to above).
Both the EPS and HEPS calculations include a R14 million IFRS 2 charge, of
which R11 million is a once-off charge,
related to an equity-settled staff share incentive scheme implemented
during the six-month period.
- Inventory increased to R449 million due to the increase in company owned
CTMs and higher stock holdings at the
Group's two Distribution Centres and Cedar Point business - a deliberate
strategy to promote an expanded merchandise range
and support customer demand for always-in-stock product. The increase is
also a function of anticipating supply delays
while Chinese markets remain closed over that country's New Year
celebrations. Management is satisfied that the stock on
hand is current and saleable, and that levels should be reduced by year
end.
- Capital expenditure of R102 million was incurred (2012: R95 million)
largely aimed at enhancing the Group's global
property investment portfolio and revamping store shop fittings and
signage.
- Cash and cash equivalent reserves at the end of the period were R177
million reflecting capital expenditure, the
per share declared for the 2013 financial year and
continues to be strongly cash generative, and
adequately employed.

- The Group's stated policy to offer the right product in the right place at
the right time and price drove an

inconsistency of supply and quality. This strategy was
supported by the Group's integrated supply chain which enabled competitive
pricing and ensured stock availability.

during the period and good progress was

achieved in instilling practices to foster sustainable businesses.

Operational review
Improved revenues were recorded by the retail operations and supply chain
businesses, and the Group gained market
share across most of its merchandise categories. Each of the three brands,
Italtile Retail, CTM and TopT increased both
their basket sizes and the number of transactions completed. Good growth was
reported in all regions with the exception of
Limpopo and the Free State. The improved performances delivered by the
Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal regions are
attributable to the Group's deliberate strategy to re-invigorate
underperforming regions through enhanced management structures,
facilitating greater collaboration between stores regarding stock management
and benchmark operating practices.
Italtile Retail
Entrenched as the industry fashion trend-setter, this brand advanced its
growing presence in the up-market commercial
projects sector, reporting solid growth in tile and sanitaryware sales. The
business intends to expand this offering
in the future.
One new store, The Glen, situated in Southern Johannesburg, was opened
during the six months. The solid initial
performance delivered by this store is expected to continue to improve.
CTM: South Africa
During the period good volume growth was reported by the business,
particularly in the tile and bathroom furniture
categories. The Group's Summer promotion proved very popular and innovations
in marketing formats boosted customer
awareness, resulting in sound growth in advertised products of brands such
as Tivoli and Kilimanjaro.
CTM progressed its goal to deliver an appealing shopping experience,
revamping 19 stores, 11 of which were major
refurbishments. A further 12 stores will undergo revamps in the next six
months.
Launched in April 2013, the CTM web-store underwent further enhancement and
development, resulting in substantially
increased pre-purchase online activity. This offering is a strong marketing
tool and in-store enabler, affording the Group
an important strategic advantage.
CTM: Rest of Africa
Good growth was achieved in the East African region, with the recently
opened store in Nairobi trading soundly and a
new store opened in Tanzania. However despite this performance and the
strong demand from markets in the territory,

Page306of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.logistical and infrastructural constraints continue to hamper expansion of
the Group's store footprint.
Sales in neighbouring countries, Swaziland, Namibia, Lesotho and Botswana
also increased due to improved stock
availability and an enhanced offering.
CTM: Australia
During the period the Group disposed of its eight store CTM retail business
in Australia via a facilitated management
buyout. The intention in the short term is to retain and manage this
operation's property portfolio; market conditions
will determine the longer term strategy regarding this investment.
TopT
This business delivered strong growth in home-finishing products catering
for entry-level price-sensitive consumers.
During the review period four new stores were opened and are trading well.
Management's goal is to implement an extensive
roll-out campaign of the brand network over the next five years. In this
regard, while sites have been located and
markets identified, management's key challenge is to appoint and train
suitable franchisees and store operators, an
undertaking which is critical to the success of the TopT model.
Support services
The Group's vertically integrated supply chain comprises ITD (an importer
and supplier of brassware), Distribution
Centre (an importer and distributor of tiles and sanitaryware) and Cedar
Point (an importer and supplier of laminated
flooring, bathroom furniture and décor). During the period improvements in
the supply chain were achieved, and despite
increased input costs, each of the businesses played a critical role in
supporting the retail operations through competitive
pricing. Prudent inventory levels ensured consistent availability of product
and assisted the Group in gaining market
share in a volatile environment.
Investment in associates
Ceramic Industries Limited ("Ceramic")
Production difficulties experienced in certain of Ceramic's factories as
reported at the year end were addressed in
the review period, resulting in consistently improved product quality.
The Group's tactical investment in this business aimed at supporting its
growth strategy proved particularly
beneficial in the reporting period. Uninterrupted supply of sanitaryware was
achieved during the second quarter when a general
shortage developed in the market. In addition, Ceramic's high quality large
format tiles provided an important alternative
to imported product which became increasingly costly as the Rand devalued.
Across the business, an enhanced financial performance was delivered,
resulting in a R10 million contribution to Group
profit for the period.
During the six months under review, Ceramic distributed a special dividend
to shareholders, thereby reducing the
investment value of the business on Italtile's Statement of Financial
Position.
Ezeetile
This business continued to improve its efficiencies as a result of enhanced
business processes, including the bedding
down of SAP. Good sales growth was experienced in both the Group's store
network and amongst independent customers.

Page307of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Higher imported raw material costs and distribution costs offset the
improved performance, and Ezeetile's contribution to
Group profits for the period totalled R3 million (2012: R3 million).
Global Property Investment
The Group's retail operation is supported by a strategic property portfolio
which comprises high profile, easily
accessible stores that are well maintained and aesthetically attractive,
serving to enhance the shopping experience for
customers.
Capital expenditure of R58 million was incurred on store expansion, new
build and acquisition of properties, bringing
the total market value of the portfolio to in excess of R1,65 billion, and a
carrying value of R1,18 billion.
Staff share scheme
During the reporting period an equity-settled staff share scheme was
implemented, consistent with the Group's ethos of
promoting partnership with its employees and incentivising them to
participate in the growth and profitability of the
business. As at 1 August 2013, 15 million shares were allocated to
qualifying South African staff members, including
those of franchised stores, with a minimum of three years of service,
translating into 30 000 shares per individual. The
shares have a three year vesting period, and the net shareholding at the end
of the period is dependent on the appreciation
of the Group's share price. A second allocation will be made on 1 August
2014 to all qualifying foreign staff and other
staff members who achieve three years of service at this date.
Directorate
The Group has appointed Jan Potgieter, CA(SA), as Chief Operating Officer
with effect from 1 August 2014. Mr Potgieter has
extensive senior level experience in the retail and supply chain sectors
having most recently served as Chief Executive Officer
and formerly Financial Director at his previous company, a major national
South African retailer.
Upon joining the Group on 1 August 2014, Mr Potgieter will also be appointed
to the Italtile Limited Board.
Mr Potgieter's appointment follows that of Mr Nick Booth, who will assume
the position of Chief Executive Officer with
effect from 1 July 2014.
These key appointments are in line with the Board's strategy to enhance
management depth and succession planning
across the Group.
Prospects
The impact of rising living costs on disposable income will continue to
constrain consumption, particularly in the
middle income segment. Additional anticipated interest rate increases
induced by rising inflation resulting from further
Rand weakness, will exacerbate the hardship. Markets at the top and bottom
ends of the LSM spectrum are likely to remain
more buoyant and provide good growth prospects to retailers with unique
offerings targeted at those consumers.
Inevitably the durable merchandise market segment will face increasing
pressure as discretionary spend tightens
further, and intensified price wars are likely to ensue. In this
environment, the Group's stated policy is to adhere to its
year-round value offering position (fashion, quality, price and service) and
prioritise operational and supply chain

Page308of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.efficiencies in order to provide consumers with pricing advantages wherever
possible.
The Group will continue to focus on improving performance consistency across
its stores through its Best Practices
disciplines. Continued investment in systems and skills training will remain
a priority, while innovation in products and
technology will continue to underpin the Group's unwavering goal to retain
and grow its market leadership position.
