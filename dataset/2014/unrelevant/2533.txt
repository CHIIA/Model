A THIRD consecutive year of weak uranium prices has led to Paladin Energy’s half year net loss at
$US255 million.
The uranium producer does not expect any short-term improvement either, shutting one of its two
producing mines last week and reducing production guidance for the year.

But it predicts that the nuclear power industry will recover and the future will be positive for uranium
producers, with mine closures and lack of investment in new supply leading to sharp price rises.
China National Nuclear Corp agreed last year to pay Paladin $US190 million for a 25 per cent stake in
Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia.
The company’s shares were up half a cent to 48¢ by noon yesterday. Paladin’s loss widened by 32 per
cent from a $US193.5 million half year loss last year. The result was inflated by a $US226.5 million
impairment on its Queensland exploration assets.Stripping those out, Paladin’s gross result was a
$US29.3 million loss compared to an $US11.3 million profit last year. It blamed the loss on a 21 per
cent fall in the uranium price and higher impairment of inventory at the loss-making Kayelekera mine in
Malawi.
