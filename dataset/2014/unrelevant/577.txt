ELECTORAL FUNDING

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has labelled a royal commission into union corruption a political
witch-hunt, while warning he would take a zero-tolerance approach to union corruption.

In his first public comments since a Fairfax Media investigation uncovered revelations of corruption
and links between the construction union and organised crime, Mr Shorten suggested the Abbott
government had undermined the work of law enforcement agencies by pushing for a royal
commission.

The Coalition promised before the election to launch a judicial inquiry into the Australian Workers
Union slush fund affair but is now poised to launch a royal commission with sweeping powers that
will investigate more broadly the use of slush funds.

Mr Shorten brushed aside suggestions that Labor was too close to unions such as the Construction,
Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, which is at the centre of the revelations and which donated
$618,398 to the ALP in the 2012-13 financial year.

"When we talk about election donations, why don't you ask me about the money being given by big
tobacco to the Liberal Party?" Mr Shorten said. "No one, it doesn't matter who you are, can support
corruption for breaking the law. Absolutely not. There should be zero tolerance of any criminal
activity, in trade unions or corporate Australia.

"As for the idea that the police are not up to their job, as for the idea that existing authorities are not
up to their job and we need a royal commission, I have zero tolerance for criminality in the union
movement."

On Monday, the Australian Electoral Commission published the 2012-13 annual financial returns
from political parties and donors, showing Labor's total revenue was $54.7 million last year.

Total receipts declared by all ALP branches, including from the federal branch, was $33,512,267.

Of the receipts that were declared, unions contributed $5,418,419 to the party through donations and
other payments. The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association gave the most of any
union to the ALP, handing them a declared $1,219,057.

The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union was next, at $749,626, followed by United Voice
($674,737), the CFMEU ($618,398) and the AWU ($599,235).
The Victorian Labor Party also reaped $3.65 million from the sale of some of its property holdings to
little-known Chinese investor Zhongfu Investments.
ALP Victorian secretary Noah Carroll confirmed the $3.65 million came from the sale of some but
not all of Victorian Labor's property.
