THE Australian sharemarket has closed higher after disappointing Chinese inflation data fuelled
expectations more monetary easing was yet to come in the world's second largest economy.
Inflation in China fell to 1.6 per cent in September, below analysts' forecasts of about 1.7 per cent
and the lowest in the world's second-largest economy since January 2010.

China's central bank cut short-term borrowing costs for banks, the second time in about a month, on
Wednesday.
It's also the second month for Chinese inflation to fall and the downward trend has strengthened the
prospect of more monetary easing, IG Markets chief market strategist Chris Weston said.
"The trend in Chinese inflation is lower which gives the Chinese government more scope to increase
liquidity throughout the money markets," Mr Weston said.
"As a result we are seeing bit of a boost in the Chinese equity market.
"Chinese related assets like the Aussie dollar and copper are also having a bounce as well and this
seems to be giving our equity market a boost."
Strong production reports from Rio Tinto and Whitehaven Coal helped bolster mining stocks,
particularly during morning trade.
Rio Tinto gained 25¢ to $60.99. However, Whitehaven Coal was down 5¢ to $1.49, despite a 40 per
cent increase in its quarterly coal production.

BHP Billiton added 35¢ to $33.80, while Fortescue Metals shed 1¢ to $3.64.

Among the major banks, the Commonwealth Bank climbed $1.33 to $75.45, ANZ gained 22¢ to
$31.37, Westpac lifted 32¢ to $32.46 and National Australia Bank was up 32¢ at $32.54.

Telstra was 9¢ higher at $5.38.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 38.2 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 5245.6 points.

The broader All Ordinaries index was up 34 points, or 0.65 per cent, to 5238 points.

The December share price index futures contract was 50 points higher at 5229 points, with 31,404
contracts traded.
National turnover was 1.3 billion securities worth $4 billion. AAP
