The Platts daily assessment for Australian alumina was flat at $332.75/mt FOB on February 13 with
clear signs of ample supplies of both Australian and Western-origin cargoes.
There was no shortage of alumina on a global scale and supply was readily available in the
Asia-Pacific region and from the West, several market participants said.

A consumer/reseller reported receiving two offers from traders for standard-sized Western Australia
parcels for March loading at between $355-359/mt, CIF China. Separately, a second consumer/reseller
reported receiving an offer for 50,000 mt Brazil material for March loading at $358/mt, CIF China. "The
large cargo size would require additional financing costs. Plus, at this price, I'd prefer to buy Australian
material," he added.

Buyers were expecting a further softening in prices and were not desperate to pick up tonnage as their
inventories were full. Low aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures
Exchange continued to dampen buying interest for alumina, sources also said. "Even with the higher
premiums on the LME, there's still a high cost of capital and very little return," a consumer said.
The second consumer/reseller agreed that smelters faced high operating costs. "Chinese smelters
operating costs are high and domestic aluminum prices are low, putting an additional squeeze on their
cashflows," he said.
Market participants were eagerly awaiting the results of two alumina sales. India's Nalco closed late on
February 12 a tender to sell a prompt end-February/early March lot, but it was not known on February
13 whether the sale had been awarded officially. BHP Billiton was collecting bids in its auction of a
March shipment of Worsley material from Western Australia. Bids were due by 10pm Singapore time
(1400 GMT).
The Platts daily Handysize freight assessment for alumina from Western Australia to northeast china
fell $1 to $23.50/mt on February 13, basis 30,000 mt alumina cargoes for March loadings.
The Platts China alumina assessment for Henan province was rangebound on February 13 at Yuan
2,520/mt ($412/mt) ex-works for 70:30 cash and credit terms in thin spot market activity.
China's Shandong Lubei Enterprise will maintain its 1 million mt/year alumina refinery running at 50%
capacity in 2014 because of continued bauxite supply concerns and weak market conditions, a
company source said on February 13.
Most Chinese importing refiners have been stockpiling before the ban and currently have enough
reserves to last six months to a year. They have also started sourcing supply from new markets such as
Fiji, Guyana, Guinea, and the Dominican Republic.
