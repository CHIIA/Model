Hawaiian chief executive Russell Gibbs has a tried and true modus operandi – take a vacant or
under-performing commercial asset, refurbish, re-lease then, often, recycle it.
The strategy has worked well for the Perth-based company so far and is about to be tested again
with the sale of its only east coast asset, 50 Pitt Street in the Sydney CBD. The office building is
expected to fetch around $100 million.

"We think it is the right time and the right market," Mr Gibbs said. "We are a private company and
we recycle our capital. We will tend to hold retail and trade commercial from time to time."

Hawaiian, which is controlled by Malaysian interests connected with Chiu Chi Wen, acquired the
asset back in 2006 for $50 million in a swap deal with Stockland Group.

When Hawaiian took control of the Pitt Street building, it was near empty after being vacated by
Westpac. It was also in dire need of a refurbishment.

Hawaiian gutted the tower and decided to target multiple tenants rather than one big occupier. The
group built generic fit-outs, following a major redevelopment in 2007 and 2008 with the aim of
luring tenants in quickly. Show suites were also put on display.

Mr Gibbs said Hawaiian tried a lot of innovative strategies, including short-term leases. The
secondary building, which comprises 9897 square metres, has now been upgraded substantially
and has a 4.5 star NABERS Energy rating.

The marketing campaign is being handled by James Aroney of JLL and Josh Cullen of CBRE. Mr
Gibbs said there is now an opportunity for another owner to add value.
The building is 98.3 per cent leased and several tenants, including Tribal Group, IFM Investors and
China Telecom, are moving into the second-term fit-outs.
Other companies in the building are also expanding such as SCA Property Group, Stirling
Anderson and FTI Consulting, according to Mr Cullen.
Mr Aroney said the Pitt Street property's appeal extends to its location.

It is in a corner location close to Circular Quay and Wynyard station in the CBD's financial sector.

Hawaiian is a household name in WA, where it owns and manages successful neighbourhood
shopping centres.
