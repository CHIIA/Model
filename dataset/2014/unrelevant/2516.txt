ONLINE TRAVEL AGENT HITS A LITTLE TURBULENCE

Sydney - Monday - June 2: (RWE Aust Business News) - Shares of WEBJET (SWWEB) were quite
volatile last week but failed to pull an ASX query after they moved up 34c in two days but ended the five
trading days 22c in front.

The company was queried two weeks ago after the shares fell from a high of $2.78 on May 1 to a low of
$2.30 on May 15.

In response, CFO Michael Sheehy said, "There is apparently ill-informed and inaccurate financial market
commentary which is suggesting that Webjet's Australian market share is under material threat from
unnamed overseas online travel agents.

Most locals should be well aware of Webjet due to its heavy promotion on TV networks.

"There is no factual foundation that we are aware of that can support this conclusion, Sheehy declared.
"The latest Hitwise data shows that we have increased our lead in visitation in the online travel agency
category from 12.94pc in March to 13.21pc in April.

"Although there is some evidence in the published Australian Airline traffic data that the Australian
Travel Market is subdued and without year-on year domestic leisure growth, Webjet reconfirms its
market guidance released on November 13, 2013 of EBITDA of $21.5m."

The shares hit a 52-week low of $2.22 on Monday May 26.

As an aside, Webjet disclosed the appointment of Brad Holman as a non-executive director with
immediate effect.

The appointment is made under Director's authority and Brad will stand at this year's Annual General
Meeting for formal election by shareholders.

Commenting Webjet chairman David Clarke said: "We are delighted to have secured the services of
Brad Holman who has had a very extensive international career in the travel industry including strategic
negotiations with international airlines, global distribution agreements, and a wide range of strategic
development and marketing initiatives.

Brad is a commerce graduate from the University of Western Australia.

As a non-executive director Brad will additionally join our Audit Committee." Clarken revealed.
