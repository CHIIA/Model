MEADOW Lea margarine and Mighty Soft bread are the latest Australian household brands set to fall
into foreign hands.
The troubled owner of the breads and spreads brands, Goodman Fielder, accepted a $1.34 billion
takeover offer from the Hong Kong-based investment group First Pacific and Singapore agribusiness
Wilmar International. It is a case of third time lucky for the Asian pair, which has been trying to buy
the Australian food maker for several months.

Their original offer of $1.27 billion in April was rebuffed, so they sweetened it to $1.37 billion in May.

However, since examining Goodman Fielder’s books, the pair decided to lower its bid by 2.5¢ a share.
Directors on the board of Goodman Fielder, whose brands include Praise, White Wings and Wonder
White, are recommending shareholders accept the offer.Investors appeared disappointed that the
Asian predators had lowered their offer, with Goodman Fielder’s shares falling 2.5¢, or 3.7 per cent, to
65.5¢ yesterday.
