WA business Harvey Fresh has been sold to Italian dairy giant Parmalat for about $120 million.

The deal was announced yesterday and comes after almost a year of negotiations.

The sale comes after the recent acquisitions of Mundella and the Margaret River Dairy Company
by Chinese giant Bright Foods, and Canadian company Saputo buying Australia’s oldest dairy,
Warrnambool Cheese and Butter.

Harvey Fresh, established in 1986 as a fruit processing venture, employs 250 production workers
and was owned by the Sorgiovanni family.
