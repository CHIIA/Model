NEW YORK--The S&P 500 index closed at a record high after an upbeat reading on weekly jobless
claims, while weakness in shares of drug makers helped push the Nasdaq Composite lower.

The S&P 500 rose 3.22 points, or 0.2%, to 1877.03, notching its fourth all-time high in six sessions. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.71 points, or 0.4%, to 16421.89, ending less than 1% below its
Dec. 31 record.

Recent weakness in highflying biotechnology stocks pulled the Nasdaq Composite Index down 5.85
points, or 0.1%, to 4352.13. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index exchange-traded fund, one of the
market's big gainers over the past year, fell 2.7%. Gilead Sciences and Vertex Pharmaceuticals both slid
3.6%.

Market participants appeared to be selling some strong performers ahead of the government's February
employment report due Friday, according to Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities.

The S&P 500 has rallied 5.8% over the past month despite a string of lackluster reports on U.S.
manufacturing and housing. Each of the past two monthly jobs reports have missed forecasts, and many
have pinned the recent poor economic performance on the cold weather.

Friday's payrolls report is eagerly awaited. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls increased by 152,000 in
February, versus 113,000 in January. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down one-tenth of
one% to 6.5%.

Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist for U.S. Trust, said that stocks have been rising in recent weeks
because investors anticipate a "strong snapback in growth" after winter ends, particularly from
consumers. Stocks are likely to rise should Friday's jobs report come in close to expectations, but
investors will likely brush off a disappointing report and attribute any softness to the weather, he said.

"A [jobs] number below consensus might be blissfully written off as weather-related," said Mr. Quinlan,
whose firm oversees roughly $330 billion. "Until we get confirmation about this economy, it might be a
more jagged, volatile market, but the bias is up for now," he said.

The Labor Department said Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits declined more than expected
last week. Separately, factory orders fell more than expected in January.

Some investors are leery of writing off recent economic reports as weather-related anomalies.

"I wouldn't outright dismiss the plethora of data," said Paul Simon, chief investment officer at Tactical
Allocation Group, which manages $1.2 billion in exchange-traded funds. Some downbeat reports
appeared before the recent cold snap, suggesting "there are some holes in those arguments," he said.

Mr. Simon said he favors European and Japanese stocks to those in the U.S., in part because central
banks in those regions stand ready to take more action, rather than less. The Federal Reserve is in the
process of winding down its monthly asset-purchase program.

Draghi reiterated that the central bank is ready to introduce new stimulus measures to help the
euro-zone recovery if warranted. The euro rose to its strongest level against the dollar this year Thursday
in the wake of the ECB decision.

The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.1%. France's jobless rate fell slightly more than expected, to 10.2%, in
the fourth quarter, while German manufacturing orders for January topped forecasts.

Asian markets were broadly higher. In Tokyo, the Nikkei surged 1.6% to a five-week high after Japan's
government revealed a plan to diversify the portfolio of its giant pension fund to non-bond vehicles,
fueling expectations for large-scale stock purchases. China's Shanghai Composite tacked on 0.3%.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.737% from 2.698% late Wednesday. Gold futures
rose 0.8% to settle at $1,351.70 a troy ounce, while crude-oil futures gained 0.1% to settle at $101.56 a
barrel.

Office-supplies retailer Staples slumped 15% after missing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue
estimates. The company said it plans to close 225 stores by the end of 2015 as part of a plan to cut
costs by $500 million. Declines also weighed on Office Depot, which slid 5.7%.

Costco Wholesale shed 2.8% after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales that fell short of
forecasts. Lower overseas profits and weak results from nonfood merchandise categories weighed on
the results.

Pandora Media declined 5.6% even after reporting an increase last month in listener hours and a boost
to its market share.
