Renowned WA agribusiness Harvey Fresh has been sold to Italian dairy giant Parmalat for a
reported sale price of €79 million ($A120 million).
The sale follows the acquisitions of Mundella and the Margaret River Dairy Company by Chinese
conglomerate Bright Foods, and Canadian company Saputo taking over Australia’s oldest dairy,
Warrnambool Cheese and Butter (WCB).

Harvey Fresh director Kevin Sorgiovanni said he was proud Parmalat had recognised the value of
WA’s dairy industry and Harvey Fresh’s position within it.

“Harvey Fresh operations have grown from a relatively humble juicing operations to a significant
agribusiness with large international domestic and export contracts supplied by farmers who have a
commitment to producing quality products,” he said.

Mr Sorgiovanni added that Parmalat had expressed a strong desire to drive expansion.
