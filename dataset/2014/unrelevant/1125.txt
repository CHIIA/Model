Fortescue Metals Group has inched closer towards a coveted investment grade debt status after
rating agency Standard & Poor's upgraded the company to BB+.

The upgrade to BB+ is just one notch below investment grade status and follows a record full year
profit of $2.7 billion.

"The upgrade reflects our view that Fortescue has substantially improved its credit profile with its debt
reduction, successful production ramp-up to 155 million tonnes per annum in the June 2014 quarter,
and improving credit metrics," Standard & Poor's credit analyst May Zhong said.

The agency cited Fortescue's efforts to cut it debt, which leaves it better placed to weather sharp
swings in the iron ore price. The company has cut its debt by $US3.1 billion from $US12.7 billion a
year ago to $US9.6 billion.

The upgrade is the third uplift in the long-term bond rating since October 2010 when the agency rated
the miner's unsecured debt at "B".

S&P said Fortescue's business risk was satisfactory as it solidified its position as the fourth-largest
iron ore producer in the world. But it warned that the company's lack of product and customer
diversity – it sells almost all its iron ore to the Chinese steel market – was a weakness. The agency
estimated that an iron ore price of $US60 per wet metric tonne represented Fortescue's break-even
level.

S&P said it might consider lowering the rating if Fortescue's credit metrics worsened. It estimated that
a fall in the in the iron ore price to $US80 a dry metric tonne would pressure the rating. At present the
iron ore price is around $US91.90 per dry metric tonne out of China and the price hasn't been below
$US80 a tonne for five years. In February 2011, iron ore peaked at $US192 a tonne.
The company's financial profile was still a "significant" risk, the agency said,
While the company is just one notch away from achieving investment grade status, the agency said it
would have its work cut out to get another uplift.
"An upgrade is less likely in the short term unless the company has a demonstrably much more
conservative financial policy and financial risk profile," the agency said.
Investors in Fortescue's bonds have seen a sharp decline in bond yields. The February 2018,
6.75 per cent bonds had yielded as much as 9 per cent in October 2011, but have traded below
5.30 per cent since March this year. Fortescue's shares closed 1.34 per cent lower on Friday
at $4.42.
