Arrium chief executive Andrew Roberts says a partial mothballing of his iron ore operations
remains a possibility as he urged investors to look past the under-fire mining business at the
growth potential in grinding media.
Amid concerns about its debt levels, the steel, iron ore and mining consumables group hosted an
investor day on Monday to talk up the quality and stability of its consumables division.

Despite a $754 million equity raising, Arrium's balance sheet remains stretched and its steel and
mining earnings are under pressure due to the collapse in iron ore prices and depressed steel
margins.

"We have to look to continue to pay down debt," Mr Roberts said.

"[But] this business [grinding media] is a very good business. We have strong market positions with
very good customer relationships. Investors need to look at the value of the three different
[business] segments."
Arrium's mining consumables business also supplies rail wheels and mining ropes, but the core of
its earnings comes from grinding media. Mining companies use grinding media to crush ore and
extract minerals. When grinding balls wear out they are replaced.

In the wake of the capital raising Arrium shares crashed to record lows. The stock rebounded 10
per cent on Monday to 26.5¢ amid a market-wide recovery in iron ore stocks, possibly linked to
Chinese stimulus measures.
But based on Monday's close price, Arrium has a market value of $778 million, compared with the
near $1 billion paid for the Moly Corp grinding media business alone in 2010.
"The valuation of the company reflects the challenges in mining and steel," Mr Roberts said.
"We need mining consumables to continue to improve its earnings and cash, and we need steel to
improve its earnings and cash."
Arrium expects that the volume of copper and gold ore milled in the grinding business's core North
and South American markets to grow at 9 per cent a year to 2018-19.
The company also points to declining head grades in gold and copper as indicators of strong
demand for grinding media. Lower grade ores have lesser amounts of minerals and more
unwanted rock and thus require more grinding.

Arrium said it had scale and customer advantages because Moly Corp is four times larger than its
next biggest competitor and has strategic locations in key mining regions. Critically, Arrium points
to its stable margins as a sign of earnings reliability.
