2340 GMT [Dow Jones] With the latest retail sales data showing the sector continuing to recover in June,
UBS says its top sector picks remain Woolworths Ltd. (WOW.AU), with its grocery exposure and
improved execution; Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd. (HVN.AU), with its housing exposure; and Premier
Investments Ltd. (PMV.AU), thanks to its U.K. penetration as well as its valuation and balance sheet.
Australian retail sales rose 6% in June from a year earlier, which the broker says is consistent with recent
trade feedback. Notes the grocery and household goods categories were the stand-outs, up 6% and 7%
respectively. Department stores disappointed, falling 3%, suggesting further market share loss to the
specialty apparel retailers, which were up 8%. Among housing categories, electronics, hardware and
furniture all accelerated. UBS expects growth in housing related categories to accelerate further in FY15.

Adds the key share price catalysts for the sector will be positive trading updates during the July,
September earnings season. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)
2334 GMT [Dow Jones] Seven West Media Ltd. (SWM.AU) is going for gold, securing the rights to the
2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics and 2018 winter games. But UBS points out that, historically,
Australian broadcasters have struggled to make money from Olympics. The brokerage assumes that
SWM's Olympics investments covers their costs and estimates the impact on earnings will be broadly
neutral, with higher programming costs offsetting any one-off revenue share gains. It retains a buy
recommendation and A$2.20/share ($2.05) target. SWM last traded at A$1.96. (robb.stewart@wsj.com;

2332 GMT [Dow Jones] Crown Resorts Ltd. (CWN.AU) remains compelling value on 14 times expected
FY15 EPS and 8 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation,
according to Citi. It estimates that current gearing levels would imply about A$2.5 billion ($2.33 billion)
of net debt potential in FY17, before assuming any potential earnings from new investments including the
new Las Vegas venture. Assuming a 60% equity stake in the Vegas site, Citi estimates Crown would
only need to fund another A$360 million for the project. "With an expectation for about A$1.5 billion of
potential capex at Crown Barangaroo expected to be spent largely in FY17-FY19 and now Vegas, with a
potential small equity component to the investment, there seems to be adequate balance sheet to fund
these potential investments," the broker says. Rating remains Buy with a A$21.40 ($19.94) target price.
CWN last A$15.20. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2324 GMT [Dow Jones] Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO)
attributed stronger-than-expected quarterly results Tuesday to digitally delivered games and game
content. The trend isn't new but appears more prominent in "slow" quarters, said Scott Kessler, an
analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Activision's CEO Bobby Kotick insisted that physical sales are not going away.
"There's no question when you look out five years we'll still be selling products like 'Skylanders' in stores"
while also offering digital downloads, he said. Activision is up about 4% after hours, while Take-Two is
down about the same percentage. (mikalai.shchatsko@wsj.com)

2324 GMT [Dow Jones]--EUR/USD is on a downward trend as renewed concerns over tensions in
Ukraine and worries about deflation in the euro zone prompted investors to cut their bets on the single
currency. Shinji Kureda, head of the FX trading group at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, says the pair will
likely find support at 1.3350 in Asia. "The pace of its fall tends to be slowed at every 50 points due to
option-related buying. But once that point is broken, 1.3300 will come into sight," he adds. The pair is at

though policy changes aren't anticipated, Mr. Kureda says. (tatsuo.ito@wsj.com)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones] NZD/USD gained on news that New Zealand's 2Q unemployment rate was a
better-than-expected 5.6% but fell on news that the participation rate and the quarter-on-quarter job
growth rate were worse than tipped. "That offset the better news on the unemployment number," says
Wellington-based OM Financial client advisor, Stuart Ive. He notes that after the overnight tumble in
global dairy prices, things were already weighed against the Kiwi and "any spikes will likely be sold into."
The pair is at 0.8439, and Ive says it has support at 0.8420 and resistance at 0.8500.

23:19 GMT [Dow Jones] KKR & Co. (KKR) and Rhone Capital's A$5.20/share indicative offer to acquire
Treasury Wine (TWE.AU) looks attractive, but several risks remain, says J.P.Morgan. Investors should
be mindful of the experience of Goodman Fielder, which recently recommended a cut-price offer from
Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. (F34.SG) and Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. (0142.HK) after they
wrapped up due diligence. "There is no guarantee that a bid (for TWE) will emerge post due diligence, let
alone that it will remain at A$5.20 per share," J.P.Morgan says. "This risk requires a discount." Also, the
broker believes the best-case completion date is September 2015, with due diligence likely to take four to
six weeks, a scheme meeting taking six weeks to arrange, and the deal almost certain to require
approval from China's Ministry of Commerce. J.P.Morgan, which rates Treasury Wine at underweight,
thinks the stock should be trading at A$4.80/share. TWE last traded at A$5.17. (david.winning@wsj.com;
@dwinningWSJ)
23:19 GMT [Dow Jones] The rally in Treasury Wine Estate's (TWE.AU) share price suggests more
downside risk than upside for investors, even against the backdrop of a raised bid from KKR and Rhone
Group, says UBS. It lifts its sum-of-the-parts-based target on TWE to A$4.33/share from A$4.20 but
retains a sell recommendation. The brokerage says TWE's strategy, including spending on a narrowed
brand portfolio and bringing forward the release dates for premium wines, makes sense but execution
isn't certain. It anticipates further cost cutting to accompany the upcoming fiscal 2014 results as well as
possibly more impairment charges, which will further cloud the wine company's near-term earnings
outlook. TWE closed Tuesday at A$5.17. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
23:07 GMT [Dow Jones] Harold Park in suburban Sydney is used to winners and losers, as the site of a
former paceway where punters would gather to bet on harness racing. Now, it looks like paying off for
Mirvac Group, an Australian property developer that dug up the track and is building dozens of
apartments there. J.P.Morgan says Mirvac's FY15 earnings growth will be dependent on the margin at
Harold Park, as it likely will provide more than 50% of residential revenue. "We're increasingly confident
on Harold Park given sales are 18 months ahead of feasibilities where Mirvac's focus has been more on
velocity of sales as opposed to price growth," the broker says. "This should ensure healthy project
margins through FY15-18, and more than A$1 billion in revenue." J.P.Morgan, which rates Mirvac at
overweight with a A$1.93 price target, expects the company to report an FY14 operating profit of
A$439.9 million on Aug. 21. MGR last traded at A$1.78. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2306 GMT [Dow Jones] Xerox Corp. (XRX) is moving toward rapid prototyping of services in its
innovation group, according to chief technology officer Sophie Vandebroek. The copy machine pioneer
needs to innovate in services now that the company has transitioned to providing back office services.
Xerox is taking a page from a software development method known as Agile, which focuses on smaller
projects and quick iteration. Innovation may be needed on the services side to offset falling sales of
printers and copiers in the most recent quarter. (rachael.king@wsj.com, @sfwriter)

23:00 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY is likely to consolidate the downside after renewed concerns over
the Ukrainian situations stoked risk-averse sentiment among investors overnight. "The sentiment isn't
good and the topside will be heavy," says Shinji Kureda, head of FX trading group at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking. But the market reaction to this sort of news tends to be short-lived, and the pair could be
supported around 102.40. Meanwhile, the topside will likely be capped around 102.80. The pair is at
102.63 against 102.59 in late New York on Tuesday. Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, was
quoted by Bloomberg News as saying Russian units are poised to pressure or invade Ukraine.

22:55 GMT [Dow Jones] RBCCM upgrades Downer (DOW.AU) to Outperform from Sector Perform after
raising its target price to A$5.20 from A$5.00. The broker points to significantly lower debt, a share
buyback and marginally higher forecasts behind the upgrade. "The irony for Downer is that whilst it has
reported a very strong cash flow result, its share price has fallen," analyst Heath Andrews says. "On a
relative basis, we see Downer as good value in the sector and believe it should rally on the back of what
was a solid FY2014 result." It adds that Downer is trading at a 6.3 times expected FY2015 enterprise
value to earnings before interest and tax, a 23% discount to peers. DOW last A$4.58.
