Wilmar, First Pacific sweeten Goodman bid by A$100M, won't go higher without rival offer
May 16 (BusinessDesk) - Singapore-based Wilmar International and Hong Kong-listed investment firm
First Pacific Co have sweetened their takeover bid for Australasian food ingredients maker Goodman
Fielder by A$100 million, but won't go any higher without a rival offer.

Wilmar, the world's biggest palm oil processor, and First Pacific are offering to pay 70 Australian cents
a share, or A$1.37 billion, for full control of Goodman, up from a previous bid of 65 cents, or A$1.27
billion, they said in separate statements today. The bid is a 4.1 percent premium to Goodman's last
trading price of 67.2 Australian cents on the ASX. Goodman's board has until Friday night to open its
books for due diligence and recommend the deal. The dual-listed shares were halted in New Zealand
and Australia yesterday.
"The company and First Pacific will not increase the price further in the absence of a competing
proposal," Wilmar said.
The Asian companies are seeking to buy Goodman through a scheme of arrangement, meaning they
only need 75 percent support to take control rather than the 90 percent target for a hostile takeover.
Goodman's board knocked back their earlier offer as opportunistic and materially undervaluing the
company.
Wilmar bought a 10 percent stake in Goodman in 2012, and registered interest in the food ingredients
maker's assets which were up for sale at the time.

In February, Goodman forecast normalised annual earnings to be "broadly in line" with the previous
year's A$185.6 million as soaring milk prices and intense competition in baking goods eroded
profitability.
The maker of household brands including Vogel's bread, Meadowfresh milk and yoghurt, and
Meadowlea butter and margarine has been cost cutting, restructuring and divesting over the past three
years, to focus on its core brands and reduce debt.
