China's services PMI weaker than expected
HSBC/Markit Economics reported China's Services Purchasing Managers Index fell to 50 in July from
June's 53.1. An official gauge released on August 3 had dropped to a six month low of 54.2.

The services sector report contrasts with the HSBC/Markit Manufacturing PMI which rose in July to an 18
month high of 51.7. The government's manufacturing PMI also increased to 51.7, the fastest expansion in
two years.
Our market fell through the 5535/40 level of support, on negative eco news out of China, our trade deficit
widening and the RBA expecting below trend growth for some time. Downer EDI's comments also
illustrates how significantly the mining majors are clamping down. At the junior explorer end, a major
contributor to the future of the sector, mergers with each other (to save annual ASX fees), becoming shells
for backdoor listings and courting takeovers illustrate the hardship many are facing.

"High will be 5561. Low will be 5530. Close at 5544, up 3.1 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract pointing up 4 points. US equities managed to close higher overnight,
although the volume on the move suggests it is just a bounce, rather than the initiation of a new rally.

"Widening credit spreads and the under performance of the banks and small cap stocks in the US, are
indicative of tightening liquidity, which by extension, implies further downside for equities in due course.

"But none of this matters for today. The high will be 5561. The low will be 5530. When the dust has settled,
the market will have closed at 5544, up 3.1 points'.

The s&p/asx200 closed down 15.5 points to 5540.9 points last evening.

Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5%.

Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace, helped by firmer conditions in the
advanced countries. China's growth remains generally in line with policymakers' objectives. Commodity
prices in historical terms remain high, but some of those important to Australia have declined this year.

Financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain
very low. Emerging market economies are receiving capital inflows. Volatility in many financial prices is
currently unusually low. Markets appear to be attaching a very low probability to any rise in global interest
rates, or other adverse event, over the period ahead.

In Australia, growth was firmer around the turn of the year, but this resulted mainly from very strong
increases in resource exports as new capacity came on line; smaller increases in such exports are likely in
coming quarters. Moderate growth has been occurring in consumer demand. A strong expansion in
housing construction is now under way. At the same time, resources sector investment spending is starting
to decline significantly. Signs of improvement in investment intentions in some other sectors are emerging,
but these plans remain tentative as firms wait for more evidence of improved conditions before committing
to significant expansion. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects
growth to be a little below trend over the year ahead.

There has been some improvement in indicators for the labour market this year, but it will probably be
some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Recent data showed an increase in inflation,
with both headline and underlying measures affected by the decline in the exchange rate last year. But
growth in wages has declined noticeably and is expected to remain relatively modest over the period
ahead, which should keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate.

Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and for some borrowers have
continued to edge lower over recent months. Savers continue to look for higher returns in response to low
rates on safe instruments. Credit growth has picked up a little, including most recently to businesses. The
increase in dwelling prices has been slower this year than last year, though prices continue to rise. The
exchange rate remains high by historical standards, particularly given the declines in key commodity
prices, and hence is offering less assistance than it might in achieving balanced growth in the economy.

Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help
growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3% target over the next
two years.
In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in
demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course
is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

Deficit of $1.636 bln in June, up 52% on May deficit

The ABS reported in trend terms, the balance on goods and services was a deficit of $1,636m in June

decrease of $360m (18%) on the deficit in May 2014.

In seasonally adjusted terms, goods and services credits rose $125m to $26,620m. Rural goods rose
$135m (4%), non-monetary gold rose $68m (7%) and net exports of goods under merchanting rose $1m.

other merchandise goods rose $10m. Services debits rose $29m.

(70%) on the deficit of $20.0b recorded in 2012-13, resulting from a $30.3b (10%) increase in goods and
services credits partly offset by a $16.3b (5%) increase in goods and services debits.
M/v sales in July down 0.4% on pcp

NEWS OF THE DAY
Perth Mint sales of gold and silver fall to 3 month low in July
The Perth Mint's sales of gold and silver dropped to a three-month low in July, as increasing optimism
about global economic growth curbed appetite for the
precious metal. The Perth Mint runs the only gold refinery in Australia, the
world's second-biggest gold producer after China. Sales of gold coins and minted bars nearly halved to
25,103 ounces in July from the same period a year ago, data available on the mint's website showed.

China to ban coal use in six main districts by end 2020 - Xinhua
"The Age" reported quoting China's official news agency Xinhua, Beijing will ban coal use in its six main
districts by the end of 2020, state media cited the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau as
saying, as the Chinese capital steps up efforts to combat air pollution.
Beijing and the surrounding area in China's northeast is often wreathed in noxious smog, which has been
cited as a factor in high rates of lung cancer.
Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai and Shijingshan districts will all stop using coal and
coal products and shut down coal-fired power plants and other coal facilities, the official Xinhua news
agency said on Monday.
In 2012, coal made up one-quarter of the city's total energy consumption, Xinhua quoted official statistics
as saying.
Fuel oil, petroleum coke, combustible waste and some biomass fuels will also be prohibited as part of the
effort to fight pollution, Xinhua said.

broker said results point towards faster market C1 growth for 2014, with growth in bi-laterals likely to be
the driver of this gain. "For COH to meet guidance requires significant market share restoration.

Guidance

Downer EDI Ltd announced in its outlook statement that while the forward outlook varies by market, with
government related expenditure on capital and services looking promising while resource based
expenditure is expected to be flat, or declining from the current low levels, "for the 2015 financial year,
Downer is targeting NPAT of around $205 million".
However while mining commodity markets are currently very difficult for a number of Downer's major
customers with a short term impact on service providers like Downer being hard to predict, longer term this
pressure will drive increased demand for Downer's services as companies look for more efficient service
delivery.

Analysts expectations: $214.8 mln/$213.5 mln, div 11c/$220.9 mln/$216 mln div 15c.

Following the profit result: A leading broker following Downer EDI's profit result today retained an
"underweight" on Downer with a share price target of
The broker said the full year result was broadly in line with its $212 million forecast (came in at $216
million), th final 12c dividend was well below the broker's 15.8c forecast and Downer guided to 2015
NPAT of $205 million, down 5% year on year vs the broker's $203 million forecast and consensus
expectations of $208 million.

The broker said the buyback is a surprise, although the number of shares yet to be determined.

*On July 25 a leading broker retained an "add" on Downer EDI, expecting it to beat on P&, operating cash
flow, net cash and likely full year 2015 guidance (where consensus is going backwards). A good result is
starting to be factored into the price, but the share price could run further as it is trading at a discount to
peers'.

growth prospects. Trading at 18.8x full year 2015 EV/EBITDA with a 5.1% yield and 9% DPS growth p.a.
over the next three years we maintain our Add rating on an increased $7.97 target price".
*Another leading broker with a "buy" recommendation and a $8.40 target price said it expects a first year
proportionate EBITDA contribution from NorthConnex of around $42 million in 2020 which grows to $58
million in full year 2125 and at around 6% p.a. thereafter.

The broker reduced its traffic growth assumptions on the Westlink M7 from 2018 onwards reflecting a
slowdown in demand from heavy traffic due to the impact of the truck toll multiplier.

The broker (which has a Nil net earnings report for 2014) said it continues to view the stock's 10% p.a.
average 5 year distribution growth and near term catalysts as attractive. It retained a "buy"
