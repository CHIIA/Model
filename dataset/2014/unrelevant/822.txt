0341 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's central bank said Wednesday it was in talks with the country's
financial-services regulator over the introduction of added clamps on lending to cool the country's
investor-led house-price boom. "The bank is discussing with the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority...additional steps that might be taken to reinforce sound lending practices, particularly for
lending to investors," it said in its twice-annual review of financial stability. Still, there was no detail on
what was being discussed, and no sense of urgency just at the moment. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter:

0328 GMT [Dow Jones] About 18,000 unionized workers of Hyundai Heavy Industries (009540.SE) on
Tuesday began voting to decide whether to strike or not after wage talks with management broke down
earlier this month. "Originally we were going to finish our vote this Friday, but changed our plan," a union
official said Wednesday. The official added that the union believed the company was blocking workers
from going to the polling stations, and would therefore keep the vote open until it got a clear indication
from workers on their support for the strike. Union demands include a 6.5% rise in basic pay and a 250%
year-on-year bonus increase. The company says that is too much. If workers strike it will be Hyundai
Heavy's first since 1994 when a 63-day stoppage cost it 530 billion won ($522 million). Hyundai Heavy
is up 1.1% at 143,000 won, outperforming the broader market's 0.1% gain. (in-soo.nam@wsj.com)

0328 GMT [Dow Jones] The fragmentation of swaps trading across US and non-US lines will have
potentially costly and destabilizing consequences, according the commissioner of the U.S. Commodities
Futures Trading Commission. In prepared remarks for a futures industry conference in Geneva on
Wednesday, J. Christopher Giancarlo is expected to say he believes a trade crisis is looming in the
derivatives markets because of the "uncoordinated approach" by the U.S. and Europe to regulating
swaps. He plans to urge a return to the joint understandings reached by the group of 20 global leaders
five years ago at a summit in Pittsburgh, and to acknowledge that the CFTC started the rift by violating
the spirit of an earlier pact between the U.S. and Europe.(katy.burne@wsj.com)

0309 GMT [Dow Jones] Citigroup projects tourism arrivals in Thailand next year could rise 8% from
2014, adding this figure could be conservative side. The big question is whether Chinese tour groups will
come back in a big way despite political turmoil on the streets of Bangkok and Thailand's curbs on the
sale of unrealistically cheap tours. These have been essentially a means to lure Chinese visitors to
Thailand and compel them to buy over-priced goods and services once in the country. Visitor arrivals
were down 11% year to date at the end of August, and Citigroup estimates the full year decline could be
9%. The outlook for 2015 won't be clear for some time, though. "While our assumptions for next year

Year) before getting more optimistic," Citi said in note to clients. (james.hookway@wsj.com)

0304 GMT [Dow Jones] The EUR/USD may try 1.28 if Germany's Ifo Business Climate Index for
September indicates a deterioration in business sentiment. Index data is due later today. This comes
amid a slowdown in emerging economies and conflict in Ukraine, fueling speculation for further easing by
the European Central Bank, says Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities. "The fact that the
EUR/USD was unable to challenge its resistance point of 1.293 level yesterday indicates how persistent
the EUR's bear trend is," says Ishikawa. Should the German index reflect downbeat sentiment, the pair
may change its trading range to 1.27 assuming brisk U.S. new residential sales data for August later
today. The EUR/USD is now at 1.2851 compared with 1.2847 late Tuesday in New York.

0252 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesian stocks may weaken ahead of a vote in parliament Thursday that will
decide whether a deeply unpopular proposal to scrap regional elections goes ahead, Trimegah
Securities says. The proposal, "if approved, is a negative [driver of] sentiment for the market," the
brokerage says, even though it may be later overruled by a higher court. Indonesian's JSX index trades
slightly higher early Wednesday, up 0.2% at 5197, but down 0.6% in the week-to-date.

0249 GMT [Dow Jones] The Intercontinental Exchange Dollar Index is buoyant in Asian trade
Wednesday as U.S. yields edged higher--the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is at 2.540% versus 2.529%
late Tuesday. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the Dollar Index's short-term technical outlook is
positive as the five- and 15-day moving averages are advancing, while the daily slow stochastic measure
is staying elevated near the overbought level. Resistance is at 84.861 (the four-year high hit Monday); a
breach would expose the upside to the upper 20-day two-standard deviation Bollinger Band (now at
85.376). Support lies on the 10-day exponential moving average (now at 84.405); a breach may the
target the middle 20-day Bollinger Band, now at 83.926. The spot Dollar Index is at 84.639.

0241 GMT [Dow Jones] The Singapore dollar will likely mark time against the U.S. dollar in the near-term
after a benign reading of August inflation, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. says in a note. "Expect a
S$1.2660-S$1.2710 range to hold" for the time being, OCBC says, with official inflation data released
Tuesday doing "little to derail the view that the Monetary Authority of Singapore would remain static at
the October meeting." The U.S. dollar trades 0.1% weaker against the Singapore dollar early
Wednesday, last at S$1.2676. (jake.watts@wsj.com; @jmwatts_)

0235 GMT [Dow Jones] Chinese consumer confidence sinks for a second month in September as falling
house prices loom large, according to Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Survey. The index falls
0.1% to 113.2 in September from 113.3 in August, representing a fall of 7% since January. The fall in
consumer confidence "raises questions about whether the authorities' efforts to support the economy
since the spring will be sufficient to keep growth in line with the 7.5% target this year," Westpac says.
Expectations for house prices fall for a third consecutive month, with 20.4% of respondents saying wealth
management products were the wisest place for their savings, compared with 13.8% who said real
estate. Newbuild home prices fell month-on-month in 68 out of 70 cities surveyed by the National Bureau
of Statistics during August. The Hang Seng Index is up 0.2% at 23876.32. (gregor.hunter@wsj.com;

0222 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are steady as investors stay on the sidelines amid concerns over
liquidity constraints toward the quarter-end, say analysts. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 0.1% at
2311.66, and is tipped to trade in a 2300-2350 band. "The upward trend over the next one or two years
remains intact as the ongoing overhaul by Beijing will offer investors a large numbers of investment
opportunities," says Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities. Defense stocks continue strengthening
amid hopes for asset injections; Zhonghang Heibao (600760.SH) surges 5.9% to CNY12.70. Banks fall
as investors remain vigilant about China's economic outlook; Bank of Communications (601328.SH)
loses 0.7% to CNY4.24. The Shenzhen Composite Index is 0.4% higher at 1296.15.

0219 GMT [Dow Jones] In addition to cutting its iron-ore estimates, Australia's commodities forecaster is
trimming its expectations for 2014-15 thermal-coal export earnings slightly, saying moderate production
growth is being more than offset by sustained weakness in prices and a strong AUD. The government's
Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics expects thermal-coal shipments worth A$15.13 billion
during the year, compared to its last forecast of A$15.21 billion three months ago. In contrast, it's
expecting more sizeable export earnings from metallurgical coal cargoes on rising output and steadier
prices. It is now forecasting exports worth A$23.23 billion for 12-month period, up from A$20.83 billion
in its last quarterly report. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

0217 GMT [Dow Jones] Affin Hwang Capital recommends buyAirAsia (5099.KU) with MYR2.80 target as
it believes the worst is over for the airline and predicts a better outlook. AirAsia's share price has
remained subdued due to various headwinds including fare dumping amid stiff competition and political
uncertainty in Thailand, Affin says in a note. However, with an interim government in place in Thailand
and curfew being removed, tourist inflows may improve. In its home market, airlines are expected to stop
dumping fares as Malaysia Airlines starts restructuring, which will benefit AirAsia. The stock is up 1.2% at
MYR2.48 on Wednesday, up nearly 13% so far this year. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)
