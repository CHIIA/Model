Interpretation:

HZN is well off its best price at 47 cents and this has traded in the range 29.5 to 34.7 cents. More recently
the range has tightened in to 30 to 33 cents with now good support at 30.5 and resistance at 33 cents.
Yesterday it opened at 30.5 and closed at 31.5 cents which is the Darvas box high. It should trade back
up to 33 cents.

Snapshot:

Page125of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Horizon Oil Ltd listed as Bligh Oil & Minerals on June 30 1981, with a name change to Horizon Oil on
November 6 2002.
Horizon Oil's activities are focussed on South East Asia.
Horizon Oil today

In New Zealand HZN has 10% of PMP 38160 (Maari/Manaia) and 21% of PEP 51313 (Matariki).
In China Horizon Oil has 26.95% of Block 22/12 post the CNOOC back in, including Wei 6-12, WZ6-12
South and AZ 12-8 West fields, Wei 12-8 East field.

In Papua New Guinea it has 30% and is operator of the Stanley discovery in PRL 4, it has 27% and is
operator of the Elevala and Ketu discoveries in PRL 21 and 15% of PPL 259.

The PNG Government may appoint a state nominee to acquire up to a 22.5% participating interest in any
commercial development within PRL 4, PRL 21 and PPL 259. PRL 21 was granted with effect from March
18 2011 for a 5 year term following the settlement of legal proceedings with the PNG Government over
the acreage, which was formerly designated PRL 5.

For the half year ended December 31 2013
Horizon Oil announced a loss after tax of $US47,000 vs a loss after tax of $US6.777 million for the
previous corresponding period (pcp) on sales revenue up 255% to $US64.769 million.
EBITDAX was up 622% to $US32.782 million.
Cash on hand was $US37.1 million vs negative $US19 million at June 30 2013.
The overall loss of $US47,000 resulted from gross profit from operations of $US15.1 million which was
driven by China production, offset by depreciation, amortisation and exploration costs of $US22.4 million,
income and royalty tax of $US1.8 million, financing costs of $US8.6 million and a favorable movement
in the mark to market valuation of the convertible bonds of $US2.8 million.

Operational results:
China: During the half year HZN's working interest share of production from the Beibu Gulf fields was
636,249 barrels of oil. All 15 wells are now on production.

(On February 26 in its full year results ROC's CEO Mr Alan Linn said the Beibu development has been a
real success story, with the completed project delivering significantly ahead of reserve, production and
cost expectations. All 15 wells were on line and achieved an overall production plateau of 15,000
BOEPD).

During the half year the Horizon entered into a seismic farm in option with ROC to earn 40% of Block
09/05 Bohai Bay, offshore China, paying 40% of all exploration costs incurred until the exercise of lapse
of the option.

New Zealand: During the half year HZN's working interest share of production from Maari field was
35,895 barrels of oil.

Production for the half year was low as the Maari production facilities were shut in on July 21 to effect
interim repair works on the FPSO Raroa. Production at Maari field re-started on December 12. On
December 17 all 6 wells had been returned to production and were producing at a rate of approximately
11,600 barrels of oil per day.

Papua New Guinea: Government negotiations relating to the Petroleum Development Licence application
were finalised during the half year. The Development Forum will commence after PNG Cabinet Approval.
A small portion of the Stanley Gas field was found to possibly encroaches into PPL 259. This will have an
immaterial effect on Horizon's interest in the Stanley gas field, given its near equivalent participation in
both licences.

Work continued on the Elevala/Ketu condensate recovery project development planning during the half
year.
Horizon Oil entered into a farm in agreement to acquire a further 20% interest in PPL259 during the half
year, subject to government approvals. HZN will operate the exploration well to be drilled in the licence,
expected later in calendar year 2014.

Broker recommendations:

Well followed by brokers.

*The Financial Times reports as of Apr 04, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 12 polled investment
analysts covering Horizon Oil Ltd advises that the company will outperform the market. This has been
the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts improved on Aug 18, 2013. The
previous consensus forecast advised investors to hold their position in Horizon Oil Ltd.
*On March 26 Peter Strachan in "StockAnalysis' looked at the whole of the oil and gas sector with
comments on several stocks.

Of Horizon, he said "Horizon remains one of the cheapest stocks in the sector, but mired in heavy debt
ahead of achieving approvals for the Stanley condensate project, which will trigger payment from Osaka
Gas for its involvement in its PNG gas projects. "Political risk remains in China and especially PNG for
Horizon" Peter added.
*Macquarie Private Wealth Research maintained an “outperform” on Horizon Oil with a 12-month price
target of 60&#162; after the company reported first half results in line with expectations on February 28.
