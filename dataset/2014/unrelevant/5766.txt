Singapore oils trader Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment company First Pacific have
offered to lift their 65ï¿½-a-share takeover offer for Goodman Fielder to 70ï¿½ a share as long as major
shareholders and the Goodman board pledge their support. The revised proposal, which values the
maker of Wonder White bread, White Wings flour and Meadow Lea margarine at $1.37 billion, or $1.9
billion including debt, is lower than Goodman's major shareholders would have liked. However, it is
believed to have the backing of Ellerston Capital, which holds 13 per cent, and Perpetual Investments,
which holds 12.2 per cent. It is believed that Ellerston and Perpetual have each agreed to sell 5per cent of
their respective stakes. This would enable Wilmar and First Pacific to lift their combined holding from 10.1
per cent to 20.1 per cent - above the 19.9 per cent takeover threshold - reducing the likelihood of a
counter offer. Perpetual and Ellerston have previously said they would not accept an offer below 70ï¿½ a
share and analysts believe Wilmar and First Pacific could afford to pay between 75ï¿½ and 80ï¿½ a
share. Goodman's major shareholders have become frustrated with the board's refusal to engage with
Wilmar and First Pacific and are believed to be willing to cash in their investment at the revised offer price.
It is believed Wilmar and First Pacific have told the board and the major shareholders that the revised
offer is their absolutely final bid and that they will walk away if the conditions are not met. Goodman
Fielder representatives and their advisers were were unavailable for comment. The company requested a
trading halt ahead of an announcement regarding a potential change-of-control transaction. Goodman
shares were trading at 67.5ï¿½ ahead of the trading halt, slightly above the original offer price. !There has
been speculation for more than a week that Wilmar and First Pacific would have to lift their offer to win the
support of the board and major shareholders. Goodman Fielder chief executive Chris Delaney and
chairman Steven Gregg initially denounced
the 65ï¿½-a-share offer as "opportunistic", saying it materially undervalued the company at a low point in
its earnings cycle. Goodman shares were trading at 68ï¿½ in February and 64ï¿½ in March, before the
company unveiled a 15 per cent profit downgrade and flagged further asset write-downs. However, the
board said it was willing to discuss any proposal that maximised value for its shareholders. Last week,
Wilmar and First Pacific threatened to withdraw their offer if Goodman proceeded with plans to sell its
New Zealand dairy business. The offer is conditional on Goodman not making any material asset sales.
Goodman announced a strategic review of the NZ dairy business in February after receiving unsolicited
expressions of interest and accelerated the dairy sale process last week. The NZ dairy business could
be worth more than $600 million, compared with its current $450 million book value
and market valuations around $460 million. However, Wilmar and First Pacific said any potential sale of
the dairy business needed to be weighed against the risk it posed to the certainty of a full cash offer for
the entire business. The new offer is conditional on Wilmar and First Pacific securing approval to lift their
stake above 15 per cent. Wilmar has been sitting on a 10.1 per cent blocking stake since February 2012.
