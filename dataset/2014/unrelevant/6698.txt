SYDNEY—Australia's TreasuryWine Estates Ltd. knocked down its forecast for full-year earnings,
pouring yet more disappointment on investors who are accustomed to bad news.
The owner of wine labels ranging from the mass-market Beringer to the prestigious Penfolds Grange
said it now expects operating earnings between A$190 million and A$210 million (US$166.7 million
and $184.3 million). That compares with its October guidance of between A$230 million and A$250
million. Treasury's fiscal year runs through June.

Treasury Wine, whose dozens of other labels include Greg Norman Estates, St. Clement, Stag's
Leap and Lindeman's, pinned the earnings downgrade on difficult conditions in the U.S., China and
Australia. Its shares fell as much as 22% in Sydney on Thursday.

The bleak statement crushed what hopes there might have been that the vintner was close to turning
the corner after six months of turmoil. During that period, Treasury's chief executive was dismissed
and thousands of gallons of wine had to be poured down the drain.
Treasury Wine said it would provide a fuller update of its operations at its first-half results on Feb. 20.
The problems in the U.S. were well documented in July, when the Melbourne-based company
incurred a A$155 million charge after overestimating demand there. The miscalculation forced
Treasury Wine to steeply discount or destroy older vintages that had passed their drink-by date.
About two months later, the company dismissed its chief executive, David Dearie, and still hasn't
found a new one. A previously nonexecutive member of the board, Warwick Every-Burns, remains
his temporary replacement.

"Any investor should be skeptical," said Brad King, a portfolio manager at Armytage Capital, which
sold all its Treasury Wine shares last year. "There's no one running the place and the current board
is part of the old regime. Any new CEO's probably going to wipe the slate clean, so there are further
risks to the downside."
Another disappointment was China, once seen by the company as a beacon of hope. Prospects for
its premium wines there have soured as economic growth continues to slow and Beijing clamps down
on extravagant gift-giving among businesses and government officials as part of an anticorruption
drive.
China accounts for about a fifth of Treasury Wine's sales volume in Asia, according to some analysts.

In Australia, the vintner's decision to lift prices on some of its cheaper labels over the Christmas
holiday appears to have backfired—hurting sales over a normally buoyant period.
Wine imports to Australia have also jumped in recent years, particularly from New Zealand, which
produces white varietals such as Sauvignon Blanc that have steadily gained a reputation for quality

compared with around 7% seven years ago.
Treasury Wine also said U.S. sales remained lackluster, with costs rising following heavier
investments in branding. Australian wines rose to prominence in the U.S. during the 1990s, but their
appeal has waned as South American exporters boosted their output.

"All three divisions appear to be struggling, given a multitude of reasons, but most likely reflecting a
lack of leadership and direction," said Daniel Broeren, a Sydney-based analyst at CIMB, in a note to
clients.
