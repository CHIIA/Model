"Ceiling will be 5510. Floor will be 5473... close at 5490, up 26 points

Daniel Goulding the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "The weight of technical evidence points
to the likelihood that our market is in the later stages of an intermediate term topping process.

"From an internal viewpoint, the rally that kicked off from the middle of 2012 peaked in early to middle
2013. Since that point fewer and fewer stocks have been responsible for dragging our market higher. This
increasing selectivity is a notable feature of market tops.

"The question is the nature of the resolution: rotation between the different segments of the market or
outright migration from the market. On that front I think markets are still grappling with the inflation-deflation
dynamic.

Page265of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The internal backdrop for mining stocks is quite poor, which increases the likelihood that the head and
shoulders pattern for the Aussie Materials index will be triggered, targeting a ten percent decline from
current levels.

"Ordinarily that would bring about a decline in bond yields too, but we may find this time around bond yields
move higher, against all expectations. It has happened before. As a result portfolio managers need to be
very careful.

"But none of this matters for today.

"The ceiling will be 5510. The floor will be 5473. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5490, up 26 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 27.1 points to 5464 last Friday.

Home loans flat in April

Home loan approval numbers were flat in April, vs up 0.2% expected, the ABS reported.
The value of total housing finance rose 1.7% in April, seasonally adjusted, to $27.89 billion, the ABS said.
There were 52,109 approvals in the month, compared to 52,104 approvals in March.

Business confidence flat in May from April

The NAB business confidence survey reported business confidence remained flat in May, despite the
Coalition government's first federal budget, which has been widely credited with a sharp drop in consumer
confidence.
''That result was surprising, with firm's still discounting persistently soft levels of business conditions and
the negative sentiment surrounding the Federal budget - including the post-budget collapse in consumer
confidence," NAB chief economist Alan Oster said.

Importantly for business, forward orders gained back much of the fall record in April, jumping 5 points to
zero, although this still suggest only moderate activity in the near-term.

*ANZ/Roy Morgan job ads data for May down 5.6%

The ANZ/Roy Morgan job ads for May were down 5.6% from a 2.2% rise in April and 1.4% in March, ANZ’s
monthly survey of job advertising in newspapers and online found. ANZ has attributed the decline in
confidence and job advertising to the tough federal budget.

“The key question now is whether the fall in job ads is largely temporary,” said ANZ Senior economist,
Justin Fabo. “If it isn’t, this will be a risk to our forecast that labour demand will improve slowly this year
amid modestly better economic conditions, with the unemployment rate expected to remain close to 6% for
some time.”

“The survey measures where the trend is going we know that in recent times there has been a pretty clear
softening in a few indicators and we are seeing this today with these figures “, said Deutsche Bank
economist, Phil O’Donoghue.

Newspaper job ads were down across the country, with only New South Wales, the Northern Territory and
South Australia delivering between 0.7 and 1.4 percentage points increases.

NEWS OF THE DAY
Australian banks risk in exposure to China manageable - Fitch

Reuters reports Fitch ratings agency has released a statement that says most banks outside Asia have a
small direct exposure to China despite the recent growth, and so a slowdown in China would have only a
limited direct risk for them, says Fitch Ratings. However, they may be vulnerable to any secondary effects
from slower Chinese growth. Banks' exposure to China has been rising. International banks' direct
exposures - loans and securities claims - on China almost doubled over the three years, to USD698bn at
end-2013 in 24 countries reporting to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) on an ultimate risk basis.
Other claims, such as guarantees and derivatives, are not captured in this data. China risk concentration is
low for the largest countries outside of Asia. UK banks have the largest direct exposure, according to the
most recent BIS data, at USD200bn, but this is only 1.6% of banking system assets. Nevertheless, this is
concentrated in two banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, which have onshore activities. US banks had
USD83bn of direct claims on China, a very small 0.6% for the sector. US investment banks may also have
other potential claims, including derivative contracts. But these would still be small relative to assets.
Citigroup has a Chinese subsidiary, so is the most exposed of the US banks. Other countries with larger
exposures to China also have manageable risk - with Japan at 0.6% of assets, France 0.4%, Germany
0.4% and Australia 1.2%. Australia's exposure has grown the most rapidly, as trade has increased between
the two countries and Australian banks have pushed their expansion in Asia. Lending is related largely to
short-term trade finance. Overall exposure is relatively modest compared with the five largest banks' FCC
at 26%. .. Fitch added, "We believe there is a low probability of a "hard landing" for China's economy, and
that a China-related expansion strategy offers growth opportunities in the long term"

Ukraine and Moscow reach mutual understanding on parts of plan to end fighting

Reuters reports Ukraine said on Monday it had reached a "mutual understanding" with Moscow on parts of
a plan proposed by President Petro Poroshenko for ending violence in the east of the country.

Kiev gave no details and Russia did not comment directly but two days of talks, following a brief encounter
in France last week that broke the ice between Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin, have
given momentum to peace moves.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement released in Berlin that there was
'some faint light at the end of the tunnel" in the Ukraine conflict for the first time in months.

Only a fraction of LNG projects being built will be completed - Shell

Reuters reports only a fraction of the natural gas export projects being developed around the globe will
become reality as high costs and weakening gas prices torpedo those that until recently promised huge
returns on investment.

Page267of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Large natural gas field discoveries on and offshore have prompted several countries to plan liquefied
natural gas (LNG) export projects, including in North America, Australia, East Africa and the east
Mediterranean.

But high development costs and low profit margins in the gas sector mean most of the projects will fail,
Royal Dutch Shell's director of projects and technology told Reuters in an interview.

"There is always so much talk about these big LNG projects around the world, but only a small fraction of
them will get built," said Matthias Bichsel, who is also a member of Shell's Executive Committee.
"Costs in the oil and gas sector are still on the rise and outpacing inflation, and gas projects are extremely
price-sensitive because the margins are so thin," he added.

3-D printed reading glasses - of enormous benefit to the poor, worldwide ..

First sighted on "FiercePharma" - grateful thanks to a Broker who forwarded, and a detailed report in "The
Economist" on June 7 reports on LUXeXcel, a company based in the Netherlands, that has pioneered the
technology and used it to print some reading glasses.

"These are not yet as good as prescription spectacles, the lenses of which are individually polished. But it
is early days .. LUXeXcel calls the 3D-printing process it has developed Printoptical. It is based on a
large-format commercial inkjet printer fitted with specially adapted print heads. These heads deposit
droplets of fluid plastic to build the shape of the lens. But instead of forming layers, the droplets are allowed
to flow into one another to create a pool of liquid. The emerging pool is measured by lasers and once it has
taken on the required shape it is solidified by curing the plastic with ultraviolet light. Repeating the process
allows complex lenses to be constructed. The pooling process leaves smooth surfaces that require no
polishing.

*TRS: Lowers full year profit forecast
The Chairman of the Reject Shop today announced the company was unlikely to meet its Market Profit
Guidance for the year ended June 30 of between $17/18 million and instead expects to report full year Net
Profit after Tax of between $14.5/15.5 million.
the company said notwithstanding the tough retail conditions existing since Christmas 2034 and flat sales
fort he half year up to the end of April 2014, the company had been cautiously optimistic previous
guidance would be achieved. However, the unseasonably warm weather across the country led to a
deterioration in sales of winter related departments and ranges during May.

Also while the first week of May remained solid in sales terms, it is clear that sales for the balance of May
were significantly affected by a drop off in consumer confidence consistent with the generally reported retail
conditions during this period.
The revised profit forecast of between $14.5/15.5 million includes the impact of costs associated with the
opening of a further 13 stores in the second half and asset writedowns in respect of three stores which are
being closed, and a further 3 which are underperforming. The company also confirms the new satellite
distribution centre in Perth will open in late July, on time and on budget.
