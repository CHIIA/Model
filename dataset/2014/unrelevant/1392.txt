CST Mining Group Ltd. on June 23 posted a US$61.7 million loss attributable to owners for its fiscal year
ended March 31, swinging from the US$119.7 million profit earned in the year-ago period.
The company said that a decrease in revenue and an increase in sales costs resulted in the loss. Results
for the fiscal year included a US$60.2 million impairment on property, plant and equipment, a US$36.2
million loss on inventories written down to net realizable value, and a US$29.0 million impairment on
available-for-sale investments.

Driven by the depressed market price of copper, the company's revenue fell 9.1% to approximately
US$156.7 million, among which about US$151.9 million came from the Lady Annie operation in
Queensland, Australia.

Production at the Lady Annie project was reduced due to a maintenance program starting in early 2013.
The company has completed the program and expects it to bring long-term benefits including cost saving
to the project.

The cost of sales, including costs of direct materials and depreciation expenses, increased 14.5% to
US$144.2 million in the financial year.
The Hong Kong-listed copper producer invested US$7.1 million in exploration, mining and
development work in the last financial year.
CST Mining's revenue from property investments rose 14.8% year over year, due to stable occupancy
rates and an increase in the rental rate.
The company has previously warned investors of a loss for the six months to the end of September 2013.
