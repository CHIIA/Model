0054 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian equities are up strongly early, with the benchmark index recovering
from its lowest closing level since April on Tuesday. The S&P/ASX 200 is up 1.2% at 5440.3, with all
major subindexes higher. A pickup in the iron-ore price helps the mining sector, with BHP Billiton
(BHP.AU) up 1.8%, Rio Tinto (RIO.AU) up 1.4% and Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.AU) up 2.3%. The
major banks also recover, with Westpac (WBC.AU) and Australia & New Zealand Banking (ANZ.AU)
both 1.3% higher and National Australia Bank (NAB.AU) ahead 1.6%. Looking ahead, local trade
balance figures are due later in the session while traders shall await key employment figures due for the
U.S. tonight, says Tracey Warren at CMC Markets Stockbroking. robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

0049 GMT [Dow Jones] Drier weather and declining grain harvests will push up feed costs for livestock,
consultant company IBISWorld says and predicts industry revenue from sheep and beef-cattle farming
will fall by a "staggering" 22.6% over the next year to A$7.61 billion. "Unfortunately, bets are on for El
Nino in late 2014 meaning drier conditions with low rainfall--something pastoralists are unlikely to
welcome," IBISWorld general manager Daniel Ruthven says. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

0030 GMT [Dow Jones] Morgan Stanley's Head of Asia FX & Rates Strategy Geoff Kendrick reiterates
his call for parity on AUD/USD this year after Tuesday's Reserve Bank statement which saw the RBA
step back from trying to talk down the exchange rate, in his view. "This new regime of acceptance is
consistent with the feel I got on my recent trip to Australia where the degree of rebalancing in the
economy was evident," he says. "It's also consistent with an RBA which now accepts it can do nothing to
stop Australian dollar's rise. We reiterate our forecast for AUD/USD to reach 0.9800 in Q3 and parity in
Q4." But Mr. Kendrick adds that there's pretty universal agreement among clients that the Aussie will turn
down again after a rise to parity, as the U.S. dollar is eventually expected to rise in anticipation of higher
U.S. interest rates. AUD/USD last 0.9488. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

18:24 EDT - Early indications are that demand for the New Zealand Debt Management's 2027 bond will
be fairly strong, says BNZ strategist Kymberly Martin. "We suspect the NZ$2 billion maximum target will
be issued." She adds that there was some selling of NZ bonds ahead of this deal, with yields pushing
higher by 5 bps across the curve. The yield on NZ 2023 Government Bond now sits at 4.45%. The NZ
Debt Management Office announced Tuesday it would launch between NZ$1B and NZ$2B NZ
government bonds via syndication on July 2. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

18:04 EDT - S&P warns it believes there is at least a one-in-two probability Argentina will not make up for
the interest payment it missed on June 30 within its 30-day grace period, which started today. The
ratings firm puts the nation's rating on negative watch, saying it will lower it to "selective default" if
Argentina fails to pay the delinquent interest payment within the grace period or if it undergoes a debt
exchange. It remains up in the air if Argentina will cure the payment in time as it negotiates with holdout
creditors from a prior restructuring. S&P currently has Argentina rated CCC-. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com;

bookings, says Credit Suisse analyst Vanessa Quiroga. Cities like Puebla, home to a Volkswagen plant,
posted some of the country's highest growth rates in hotel occupancy last year, she notes, even beating
out popular Mexican beach destinations. Sources say BMW is set to join the Mexican auto-industry boom
with a $1B assembly plant, possibly in the central state of San Luis Potosi, while last week Daimler and
Nissan said they will spend around US$1.4B on a new Mexican plant. Mexico is currently the world's
eighth-largest producer of vehicles, but the government aims to leapfrog into the No. 6 spot by late 2018.

17:42 EDT - Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks at the IMF Fund Wednesday, including a Q&A session with
the Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Given the IMF's focus on global financial stability, BNP
Paribas economist David Tinsley writes in a note to clients that Ms. Yellen "is likely to describe
financial-stability concerns as manageable...while also noting specific risks that are on the Fed's radar."
Ms. Lagarde has been outspoken about the need for the U.S. to keep rates low for a good while longer, a
message that will likely get little opposition from Ms. Yellen. (pedro.dacosta@wsj.com)

17:09 EDT - Mexico's tax overhaul has been effective in boosting government revenue, with tax income
jumping 8.7% during the first five months of 2014 over the same period a year earlier, writes Alfredo
Coutino, Latin America Director for Moody's. But little has been done to control public spending, which
jumped 12.6% during the same comparative period. The government "is wasting an opportunity" to give
fiscal policy greater counter-cyclical powers that could be effective during an economic slowdown, he
notes. (santiago.perez@wsj.com; @perezenmexico)

16:35 EDT - GlobalDairyTrade books a disappointing price decline, which came despite Fonterra
reducing the volume of whole milk powder to be auctioned over coming months, ANZ Bank says. "The
decline in forecast near-term supply to be auctioned through GDT seemed to be in response to
reportedly high inventory levels in China," says ANZ Bank. "It seems the drop in near-term supply and
pick-up in latent demand from other markets hasn't been enough to stabilize the situation. This,
combined with the high NZD, means Fonterra's opening milk price forecast of NZ$7.00 per kilo of milk
solids is now under pressure." Firm says the forecast could be revised to low-to-mid NZ$6.00 per kilo.

16:21 EDT - NZD/USD remains firm despite a 4.9% fall in the average milk price in the
GlobalDairyTrade auction overnight. Weaker prices are "consistent with the downward trend in dairy
prices we expected," says BNZ FX Strategist Kymberly Martin, noting that prices have fallen 29% since
February. "This will be negative for dairy farmer payout calculations and with time will make a dent in
NZ's terms of trade and current account figures." Martin adds the RBNZ will be watching the divergence
between falling dairy prices and still-elevated New Zealand dollar. NZD/USD last at 0.8776. Martin sees
support around 0.8730 and resistance at 0.8800. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

16:20 EDT - Bond prices drop in the opening session for 2H, but some analysts say not to read that as a
sign of investors stepping up their bets against bonds. Trading volume in the Treasurys market comes in
at just 85% of its 10-day moving average, according to CRT Capital. The pressure on bonds seems
more a result of the rally in US stocks, while buyers stayed away having gotten their month-end fill over
the past few sessions. Look for clearer signs on where bonds are headed after Thursday's nonfarm
payrolls report. Ten-year notes lose 14/32 to yield 2.567%. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)
15:28 EDT - Prior to the downgrade by Moody's of Puerto Rico bonds further into junk territory on
Tuesday, Puerto Rico muni debt was having a decent year. The bonds offered a total return of 5.93% on
the year so far, through Monday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. But the bonds have been selling
off lately--they were down 1.38% on the quarter and down 4.26% on the month--and now dented further
by today's downgrade. (mike.cherney@wsj.com)
