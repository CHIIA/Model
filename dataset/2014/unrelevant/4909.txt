(RTTNews) - Australian energy infrastructure business APA Group (APAJF.PK, APA.AX) said Tuesday
that it has agreed to acquire the Queensland Curtis LNG pipeline from British energy companyBG Group
Plc. (BG.L, BRGYY.PK) for $5 billion, or A$6.05 billion.
APA Group, which owns and operates in excess of $12 billion of energy assets, noted that QCNLG
pipeline links gas fields in the Surat Basin to the QCLNG project's LNG plant on Curtis Island. The
pipeline is a key component of the QCLNG project.

Mick McCormack, Managing Director of APA Group said, "The acquisition of the QCLNG pipeline further
enhances APA's position as Australia's largest owner of gas transmission pipelines and builds on APA's
strategy of expanding its revenue base and east coast grid."

The QCLNG Project is an integrated project to convert gas to LNG and will convert gas supplied from the
Surat Basin to LNG at facilities located on Curtis Island. The project comprises two QCLNG trains with a
combined nameplate capacity of 8.5 mtpa.

Under gas transportation agreements, the pipeline revenues are fully contracted with BG Group
companies and an entity owned by China National Offshore Oil Corp. or CNOOC on a 20-year
take-or-pay basis. The primary tariff components are escalated at US CPI.
APA Group plans to raise A$1.84 billion through a fully underwritten pro-rata accelerated entitlement
offer to partly fund the acquisition. The company will fund the balance of the amount through a US$4.10
billion syndicated bank bridge facility.

The transaction is expected to close in early second quarter of 2015.For the first full financial year ending
June 30, 2016, the pipeline is expected to contribute additional EBITDA of $383 million and additional
operational cash flow of about $200 million to $221 million.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, APA Group reaffirmed its stand-alone, pre-acquisition financial guidance.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition, the company expects statutory earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA in a range of A$1.17 billion to A$1.19 billion. This is inclusive
of the accounting gain on the sale of APA's holding in Envestra.

APAJF closed Tuesday's trading at $6.60, down $0.19 or 2.81 percent on a volume of 8,600 shares.

BRGYY closed Tuesday's trading at $14.07, up $0.09 or 0.64 percent on a volume of 438,055 shares.
