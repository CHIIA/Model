SYDNEY -- A takeover fight has broken out between two of the world's biggest buyout firms for an
Australian winemaker that produces California's mass-market Beringer brand as well as the premium
local Penfolds label.
A person familiar with the matter said U.S. private-equity firm TPG is behind a 3.38 billion
Australian dollar (US$3.14 billion) rival bid for Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. that matches one made
days earlier by KKR & Co. and Rhone Group LLC.

In a statement Monday, the vintner said only that it had received a nonbinding takeover proposal from
a private-equity firm it didn't identify. Treasury Wine has given the new bidder access to its books,
according to the company, which says the identical offer wouldn't necessarily translate into a formal
proposal.

Last week, KKR and Rhone also offered A$5.20 a share -- 11% above a A$4.70-a-share proposal by
KKR acting alone in April. KKR and Rhone have also been given permission to carry out due
diligence.
Treasury Wine shares rose as much as 3.3% in Sydney to A$5.30 on Monday, a sign some investors
expect the competing suitors to fight it out. Private-equity firms including KKR, Blackstone Group LP
and TPG are flush with cash after taking advantage of buoyant share markets to sell earlier
investments valued at hundreds of billions of dollars.
Treasury Wine is the world's second-biggest listed winemaker, behind Constellation Brands Inc. of
the U.S. It became more vulnerable to a takeover in July 2013, when poor sales of less-costly brands
like Beringer forced the company to destroy thousands of gallons of wine that had passed its
drink-by date and book a A$155 million write-down.
Problems have plagued Melbourne-based Treasury Wine since its 2011 spinoff from Australian
brewer Foster's Group, which was later bought by SABMiller PLC. Back then, a glut of Australian
grapes and weak sales in the U.S. weighed on profit, contributing to a A$1 billion write-down of the
business before the spinoff.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers have been developing a taste for more expensive wines than many of
those currently produced for that market by Treasury Wine. The Australian dollar's stubborn strength
has also made the winemaker's products less attractive than competing vintages from rival regions
such as South America.
Treasury Wine is also facing intense competition in Australia, including from a wave of New Zealand
imports, while a Chinese crackdown on extravagant gift-giving as part of an anticorruption drive has
stalled sales in the world's second-biggest economy.
