QCG Resources will test the Australian market’s rediscovered appetite for nickel stocks, pushing
ahead with a $60 million initial public offering on the back of its April deal to buy the mothballed
Avebury nickel mine in Tasmania.

The price of nickel last week soared to its highest levels in two years, pushing $US20,000 a tonne on
Friday, and QCG managing director Chris Daws said the timing of the company’s acquisition of
Avebury from China’s MMG could not have been better.

Although the deal was signed in mid-April, Mr Daws said QCG and MMG committed to the sale late
last year, before nickel began a bull run that has seen its price surge more than 50 per cent in 2014.
QCG will pay about $40 million for Avebury. It has already handed over a $1.75 million deposit and
will pay another $33.25 million to close the purchase, plus two $2.5 million tranches when each of
the first 10,000t production milestones are reached.
Internal MMG figures had put Avebury’s restart costs at only $3.8 million, but Mr Daws said QCG
plans to spend $20 to $25 million on minor refurbishments, including modifications to the processing
plant to add a circuit to filter out arsenic that had posed a barrier to the production of a high-grade 20
to 23 per cent nickel concentrate.

But Mr Daws said the as-new facility was still a bargain, given its previous owners had sunk up to
$250 million into building a mine that was closed within six months of its opening, having processed
only 400,000t of ore.

Avebury was once valued for far more than that. In a top-of-the-market offer that raised eyebrows
even in the heady days of early 2008, Zinifex paid $852 million for Avebury developer Allegiance
Mining as part of its efforts to diversify away from its core zinc mining business, launching a hostile
bid only months before announcing its ill-fated tie-up with Oxiana to create OZ Minerals. Zinifex
managing director at that time was Andrew Michelmore, now MMG’s boss.

Avebury opened later that year, but was shut down within six months, as nickel prices plunged below
$US10,000/t in February 2009 during the height of the global financial crisis.

Mr Daws said the IPO documents were still being prepared.
