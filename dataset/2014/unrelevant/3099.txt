LONDON--Commodities titan Glencore Xstrata PLC swung to a net loss in 2013 thanks to a previously
disclosed write down on its acquisition of Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata, drawing fresh scrutiny onto one of
the largest deals in mining sector history.
The Swiss-based mining and trading titan said Tuesday its net loss attributable to shareholders was
$7.4 billion last year, compared with a net profit of $1 billion in 2012. The weaker result was largely
due to $11.1 billion of one-off charges.

Those included a $7.5 billion write down on goodwill generated when Glencore bought the 66% of
Xstrata it didn't already own last May in an all-share deal worth $29.5 billion. Glencore Xstrata said last
August that it had suffered a large impairment on the deal, mainly due to the falling value of Xstrata's
mining assets and new projects as commodity price expectations cool.
Glencore Xstrata isn't the only major mining company to have suffered a big hit on large deals. Rio
Tinto has written down more than half of its $38.5 billion purchase of Canadian aluminum smelter
Alcan in 2007, while BHP Billiton has incurred billions of dollars in impairment charges against its U.S.
shale acquisitions.

But the charge is still an embarrassment for Glencore Xstrata Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg, who
owns 8.3% of the company. Mr. Glasenberg has been a vocal critic of wasteful investment by the
mining sector.
Nonetheless, the Glencore boss said Tuesday he still felt "comfortable" about the Xstrata purchase.
Glencore said it now expects the merger to generate an annual benefit to its earnings of $2.4 billion,
thanks to cost savings and increased opportunities for its traders to market the commodities produced
by Xstrata's mines. The company declared a full-year dividend of $16.5 cents for 2013, 4.8% higher
than 2012, reflecting its confidence about the group's future performance.

The write-down masked a reasonable performance by Glencore Xstrata's underlying business. Its
revenue rose 9% to $233 billion last year while its keenly-watched adjusted earnings before interest
and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, rose 34% on the year to $5.97 billion, largely due to the eight- month
inclusion of Xstrata's profits and a robust performance from its commodities trading business.
Mr. Glasenberg said talks are ongoing with state-controlled China Minmetals Corp. consortium over the
sale of Glencore's $5.9 billion Peruvian Las Bambas copper project. Glencore agreed to sell the mine
to secure Chinese regulatory approval for its tie-up with Xstrata.
Glencore also said that the company is in talks with other miners over potential cooperation or joint
venture agreements where they have nearby assets. Discussions are being held with Brazilian miner
Vale SA regarding its Canadian nickel operations and Rio Tinto PLC over its Australian coal assets,
Mr. Glasenberg said. He declined to comment on whether the talks would result in an agreement.
