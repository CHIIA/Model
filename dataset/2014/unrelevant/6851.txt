Market ends week on negative note in thin trading

By Sally Rose

STOCKS
The sharemarket ended the week on a negative note in thin trading after major global equity markets
kicked off 2014 lower following the release of disappointing Chinese factory activity data on New Year's
Day. On Friday, the S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 18.2 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5349.7 in a broad sell-off that
included the biggest banking and resource stocks. Over the week, which included the New Year's
holiday, the benchmark index rose 0.4per cent with metals and mining stocks leading the gains. Price
movements were exaggerated by low volumes as the total value of shares traded over the week was
about $956 million, compared to an average weekly turnover of about $3.64 billion in the first three
weeks of December. Overseas markets fell on Thursday after major indices in the US, Europe and Asia
fell after China's National

Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index dipped 0.4per cent in December to 51 points, its lowest
reading in four months, indicating a contraction in global demand. ï¿½Another issue that could be
providing investors with some pause is rising 10-year US bond yields, currently around 3 per cent," said
CMC Markets analyst Ric Spooner. "One of the key issues for markets over coming months will be
whether the US Federal Reserve can exit from its quantitative easing strategy without pushing bond
yields too high and so dampening the outlook for economic and profit growth.ï¿½ Three of the big four
banks lost ground on Friday, with Commonwealth Bank down 0.3 per cent to $77.58, NAB 0.4 per cent at
$34.69 and ANZ 1ï¿½ to $32.21. Westpac was unchanged at $32.34. An HSBC proxy for the
International Monetary Fund's primary commodity price index reported that global commodity prices
increased by 3.5 per cent in US dollar terms through December, and were up 2.4 per cent in 2013.
ï¿½Higher energy prices provided a boost, with oil and natural gas prices rising in 2013, while cereals
were a key area of weakness,ï¿½ HSBC economist Adam Richardson said.

ï¿½In 2013 Australia's commodity price basket fell 4.1 per cent in US dollar terms, although a lower
currency helped the index rise 11.7 per cent year-on-year in Australian dollar terms.ï¿½ At the local close
on Friday the dollar was buying US89.86ï¿½, up from US89.13ï¿½. Energy stocks were mostly lower
after crude oil prices dipped following news Libya is to re-open a major oilfield, increasing global supply.
Santos lost 0.8 per cent to $14.56, while Australia's biggest oil producer Woodside Petroleum dropped
1.1 per cent to $38.13. On Thursday the company
announced it had lost a multibillion dollar contract to sell 1.5 million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas
to Japan. The news that Woodside had lost its offtake partners following plans to move its proposed
processing plant offshore was negative for a range of smaller resources services companies that will be
in the running for contracts if the Browse floating LNG project proceeds. Labour contractor Skilled Group
was the worst-performing stock, dumping 7 per cent to $3.21. Mermaid Marine, the largest supplier of
marine logistics and services to the offshore oil and gas industry, dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25.
Engineering services contractor Cardno lost 3.8 per cent to $6.85. Embattled mining services company
Forge Group shed 6.6 per cent to $1.42, as BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, emerged as
a new substantial shareholder helping to explain a mysterious spike in the

per cent to $68.36, and Fortescue Metals dropped 1.9 per cent to $5.82 as surface mining resumed at its
Christmas Creek project four days after a man was killed in an accident while working at the site. Coal
explorer Carabella Resources was flat at 44ï¿½ as the company directors recommended shareholders
accept an off-market takeover from Chinese-owned Wealth Mining for 45.5ï¿½ per share. Silver Lake
Resources was the best-performing stock for the second day in a row, climbing 8.7 per cent to 69ï¿½ as
the spot price of gold rose to $US1231.05 per ounce. Australia's biggest goldminer, Newcrest Mining,
added 2.6 per cent to $8.67 despite the risk of a looming shareholder class action.

Cabcharge dropped 3.5 per cent to $3.87 after news that a surcharge for paying by card will be halved.
