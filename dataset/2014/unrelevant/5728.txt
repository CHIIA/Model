Mineral Resources is believed to have bought a 12.1 per cent stake in iron ore rival Aquila
Resources, potentially setting up a takeover battle for the company.
A line of 49.9 millionAquila Resources shares crossed at $3.75 each on Wednesday morning.

The trade was at a premium to Aquila's last close of $3.49 a share.

Prudential was the seller of the shares to Mineral Resources. Broker BBY executed the trade.
Mineral Resources' raid comes as Aquila assesses a $1.4 billion takeover from Chinese steel giant
Baosteel and Australian coal carrier Aurizon Holdings. Baosteel and Aurizon offered Aquila $3.40 a
share cash for all shares Baosteel did not already own.

Sources said Baosteel and Aurizon's advisers, Paul Glasson from Satori and Damian Pearson at
Deutsche Bank, visited Prudential's fund manager M&G Investment Management in London this
week. Prudential's stake traded after the meeting.

The Australian Financial Review's Rear Window column foreshadowed the interloper on Wednesday
morning.

Aquila shares were trading at $3.64 each on Wednesday morning, following Mineral
Resources' purchase.

But it's widely assumed a full takeover bid is unlikely.

Sources pointed out Mineral Resources is more interested in being an infrastructure and crushing
provider than becoming an iron ore miner.

By gaining a foothold on the register, Mineral Resources can influence infrastructure negotiations and
may win additional work on Aquila-related projects.

The Baosteel/Aurizon bid of $3.40 a share provides a floor, so the downside case for Mineral would
be selling into the bid and losing $17.5 million.
