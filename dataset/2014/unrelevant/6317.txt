(SeeNews) - Nov 7, 2014 - This week Abengoa said it would buy BrightSource Energy Inc’s stake in the
500-MW Palen concentrating solar power (CSP) project in California, Chinese Hareon Solar unveiled
deals to install 900 MW of solar capacity at home, while in Brazil more than 1.65 GW of wind and solar
projects won power contracts.

Abengoa (MCE:ABG) will incorporate its molten salt technology in the Palen scheme, thus adding thermal
energy storage capacity. The Spanish firm will also build a single tower, instead of two 250-MW plants as
was the previous plan.
