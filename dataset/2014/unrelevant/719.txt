SHANGHAI, June 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Harrods Estates agency network has targeted what will
soon be the largest group of international buyers in London by signing an agency-wide partnership with
Juwai.com, the No. 1 Chinese portal for international property.

This announcement comes in the wake of similar recent partnerships between Juwai.com and
idealista.com in Spain, Italy and Portugal; RE/MAX in Australia, New Zealand and Portugal and Luxury
Portfolio International® in the US and globally.

Under the terms of the new agreement between the two companies, Harrods Estates' listings will be
marketed in Chinese by Juwai.com.

Harrods Estates' agents will also be able to upgrade their listings and office and agent branding on
Juwai.com. Available upgrades include luxury branding, additional agent profiles, additional translation
services, email direct marketing, Chinese-language property brochures, advertorials and Feature
Property listings.
Chinese Buyers in London
Chinese investment in London property has increased over 1500% since 2010 to a new total of more
than GBP1 billion per year.[1] Chinese also buy 27% of new London homes and account for 17% of the
total value of all residential property transactions in London. An estimated 60% of purchases are
investments, while 40% are for occupation.[2]
No. 1 in China
Juwai.com has been since 2011 the No. 1 website for Chinese who are buying property outside of
China. It markets 2.4 million listings in 53 countries to a monthly audience of 1.5 million. 82% of its users
are mainland Chinese.

CEO Quotes

Shirley Humphrey, Director of Harrods Estates said:
"There are 643,000 millionaires in China, with 14% more being added to that number each year.
Chinese are perhaps the most motivated and numerous wealthy foreign buyers of London real estate.
"Chinese buyers trust the London market and want to be part of this global city for the long term.
"This agreement will help our agents win more listings and sell more property. We want to leave no
stone unturned in helping them get the best price for their property."

Juwai.com Co-CEO Simon Henry said:
"Chinese buyers already know and trust the Harrods brand name, which will make it easier for Harrods
Estates to make itself an estate agency of choice.
"Sellers will seek out Harrods Estates agents because they can provide access to Chinese buyers.

ways other agents will not.
"Juwai.com doesn't just translate and advertise your listings in Chinese. We help agents build
relationships with wealthy Chinese who are otherwise hard to reach."
