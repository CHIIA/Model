UDP backs Saputo: Australia's largest private milk processor, United Dairy Power (UDP), has
backed Canadian dairy giant Saputo's bid for control of Warrnambool Cheese and Butter (WCB).
United chief executive Tony Esposito said foreign ownership had been positive for the dairy
industry and dismissed Saputo rival Murray Goulburn's (MG) claims that the co-operative structure
was the best thing for dairy farmers.

His own Victorian business is also poised to sell, or be partially sold, to an overseas buyer in the
near future.

"We have to be mindful here of what's happening," he said.
"We've been watching co-ops go broke or sell out like Bonlac, Tatura and Dairy Farmers."
He said farmer-owned co-ops were not focused and had bad business plans.
UDP, wholly owned by Mr Esposito and with annual sales of more than $200 million, has
attracted strong interest from China, but also New Zealand and local investors.

"It's not a matter if whether it's 100 per cent, 50pc or 10pc (that we sell) or whether it's a financial
investor or an industry player. I'm very mindful I have to grow the business."

Murray Goulburn may still increase its $9.50 a share bid for WCB, while Saputo's $9/share offer
will rise to $9.20 if it can secure 50pc of the target by January 22 when its offer will close.
Saputo has confirmed it has about 27pc of WCB's share rights, but Bega Cheese, which holds
almost 19pc of WCB, may ultimately decide the Saputo offer's fate.

Saputo is pressuring Bega and 10pc shareholder, Lion, to sell their stakes, hoping Bega
shareholders will want their directors to take the near-$70m in profits the business would bank by
selling its key holding.
