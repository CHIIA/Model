LATE GAIN TO CLOSE IN THE POSITIVE - LOOKS LIKE A RELIEF RALLY- $A WEAKENS
Our market closed in the positive after being down around 4 points since China's CPI and PPI numbers -
down about 10 points before that - rising in the last 70 minutes by 26 points.

While a "buy" portfolio would be the obvious culprit some stocks in the Top 20 wre barely changed
including FMG (down 3c at the close from down 3.5c) and BHP closed down 7c at the close vs being off
16c earlier, and QBE closed up 29c after being up 13c at midday, Woodside rose from up 5c at midday to
up 12c. CBA, up 1c at midday closed up 10c.

A relief rally is a likely explanation - with our market falling for four out of the five trading days - today the
only riser.
Volume was very low at $2.8 billion. The $A is at 88.81US c, down almost 50 points from last evening.

*Bloomberg in a roundup of top forecasters has numbers varying from 80US c up to 83US c for the $A -
the most accurate forecaster at predicting the $A over the past four quarters, Tim Fox, Dubai based chief
economist at Emirates expects the $A to fall to 80US c by December 31. Second ranked forecaster
HSBC is projecting a slide to 86US c, one cent below the median of 39 year end forecasters polled by
Bloomberg.
There was very little corporate news to drive our market either way - the low and falling China PPI
number was a negative, there is further eco news due out of Japan and China tomorrow, and the US
payrolls numbers are released Friday night (our time).
*Alumina rose 3c to $1.14 on 8.5m shares ahead of Alcoa's quarterly report in the US tonight.

*Forge recovered 14.5c to $1.25 on 12.7m shares.

*Kathmandu closed up 15c to $3.17 on 450,000 shares, Fletcher Building was up 20c to $8.02 on
750,000 shares while TradeMe rose 3c to $3.81 on 340,000 shares - with the NZ economy expected to
be the biggest riser this year, according to HSBC.

At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 250 points to 15,860 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
up 7.26 points to 2051.60, Hang Seng futures was up 7 pointst o 22,954 points, S&P futures were up 0.4
points to 1833, Nasdaq futures were up 0.4 points to 3565 and the Dow futures were steady at 16,407
points. Gold futures were up 60c to $1226.10. Crude futures gained 24c to $92.57.
