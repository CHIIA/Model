Small Chinese private equity firms typically find jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada too high risk
to invest in, according to Biao Chen, managing partner of Jinjiang Mining Fund.
Jinjiang Mining Fund is a small China-based equity mining fund founded two years ago. It manages
US$200 million in assets, including five gold exploration projects and one producing coal mine in China.

"With the small amount of funds, we can't really invest in Australia, Canada and other places with higher
risk. So that's why I picked up Southeast Asia as my primary focus," Chen told delegates at the
International Mining and Resource Conference in Melbourne, Australia on Sept. 22.

Chen highlighted political risk, regulatory risk and other sovereign risk, as well as the high cost of doing
business, as reasons for the lack of new private investment in Australia.

"I think it is risky to do exploration in Australia and Canada because the cost in these two countries is so
high," he said.
However, Scott Gardiner, managing partner with multinational law firm King & Wood Mallesons said there
is an increasing number of Chinese investors flocking to the Australian mining sector.

"I do agree we're certainly a high cost and high regulatory environment, but I think there is an appetite in
Chinese investors that still sees Australia as an attractive destination," he told attendees.

The percentage of private deals being done in Australia have to date been smaller by number and value.
However, that is likely to change, according to Gardiner.

"The trend is clearly heading in the positive direction," he said. "I think we will see more private
transactions done in Australia and I also I think you will see a greater mixture between the [state-owned
enterprises] and the private."

Gardiner pointed to the increasing number of hostile takeovers in Australia as evidence of the rising level
of private money being injected into the country's mining sector.

"I think you're now seeing some of those private investors, and statistically all of the hostile bids in
Australia have been done by [private-owned enterprises], none of the [state-owned enterprises] have
launched hostile bids in the Australian market to date," he said.

Professor Colin Roberts, a representative of the World Bank Group's Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency, told delegates that foreign direct investment is set to reach US$1.6 trillion in 2014, US$1.7 trillion
in 2015 and US$1.8 trillion in 2016.

State-owned enterprises will account for 11% of the total and developed Asia will be the largest recipient
with US$400 billion in and US$300 billion out.

"The money is around for sure, but the confidence perhaps in the resource industry isn't quite there and
perhaps it's not there in the developing world as well," Roberts said.
