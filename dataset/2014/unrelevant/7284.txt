2322 GMT [Dow Jones] New Zealand's milk season is off to a strong start despite lower prices. In the
June to September period, milk collection was up 4.5% on the year, dairy giant Fonterra says. Milk
collection was up 3.9% in September versus the same month a year earlier. "Despite some unsettled
weather, favourable pasture growth in the North Island has helped maintain early season volumes above
last year's levels," Fonterra says. Volumes are approaching peak collection for the season, which is
forecast for mid-October 2014. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)

2322 GMT [Dow Jones]--Sentiment in the iron-ore market is vastly more bullish after strong Chinese
import data and robust demand from the world's No. 2 economy post-Golden Week holidays. But
analysts caution the jump could be little more than a dead-cat bounce without more strong indicators to
back it up. "Further supportive Chinese data will be needed to sustain the overnight rally in iron ore as
yesterday's support from import figures is unlikely to linger," analysts at ANZ write in a note. Iron-ore
prices rose 4% Monday, to US$83.10/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones] The spot price for iron ore may well have bottomed for the year and could edge
back up to $95/ton, which make it opportune to buy or short-cover leveraged Australian iron-ore equities,
suggests Bell Potter Securities executive director Charlie Aitken. "Don't worry about analyst valuations or
any of that. They meant nothing on the way down and will mean nothing on the way back up," he says.
"This is about spot iron ore bottoming and iron-ore equities following the spot price as leveraged
derivatives of that spot price." Still, if investors are looking for stocks to sell, Aitken says they should
consider the energy sector as oil prices continue to fall sharply. Overall, he shifts his tactically bearish
stance on Australian equities to neutral. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones]--Morningstar remains upbeat about James Hardie's (JHX.AU) medium-term
earnings outlook and an improving operating environment, particularly as the U.S. housing market
improves. A key driver for the company is its cost advantage, which is underpinned by a commitment to
research and development that has delivered a number of patents on its leading products. The
investment-research firm expects the building materials company will file patent applications in the next
few years, extending its market leadership. "Competitors will be forced to spend more money on
manufacturing and material to compete effectively, which we do not envisage," analyst Tim Mann says.
Morningstar has a reduce recommendation and A$12/share fair-value estimate. JHX last traded at
A$11.28. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS lifts James Hardie Industries PLC (JHX.AU) from Sell to Neutral, citing
recent Australian dollar weakness and a positive outlook for the U.S. housing industry. The broker
estimates that every 1 cent move in the currency has added 0.8% to the company's Australian dollar
earnings, and says further falls are possible. UBS says U.S. housing starts are expected to grow by 15%
in the next two years. "Longer term, the millennials should boost starts as this age group moves out of
home." Lifts target price to A$12.25 ($10.63) from A$11.85. The stock last traded at A$11.28.

2318 GMT [Dow Jones]--Growthpoint Properties Australia (GOZ.AU) has limited headroom for
acquisitions, says UBS, which rates the stock at neutral. "We estimate Growthpoint Properties has
capacity to acquire around A$150 million additional assets before exceeding the maximum target
gearing of 45%," UBS says. If Growthpoint Properties spends A$100 million on acquisitions, UBS thinks
earnings would increase by around 1.3% in FY15 and 2.5% in FY16. That assumes a 7.4% yield and

GOZ last traded at A$2.65. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2235 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Australia's central bank said Tuesday a sharp decline in the Australian dollar
since early September will do some good for the economy, but the currency remains fundamentally
overvalued and needs to go lower. Guy Debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) at the Reserve
Bank of Australia, said a lower currency was needed to help the economy rebalance as a decadelong
mining investment boom fades and commodity prices tumble. "Australia's terms of trade has continued to
decline and some key commodity prices for Australia, most notably the iron ore price, have declined
considerably. On that basis, the Australian dollar is still higher than most conventional estimates of
fundamentals would indicate," Mr. Debelle said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

2233 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS downgrades SAI Global (SAI.AU) to neutral after the compliance-services
provider ends discussions with potential acquires for all or parts of the company. "In our opinion the
process over the past four months has highlighted a number of issues, none of which are positive for the
stock in our view," the broker says. These include the long absence of a CEO and slow progress
appointing a new one, earnings risk from the renegotiation of a major contract, and the removal of a
historical takeover premium priced into the stock. UBS slashes its price target on SAI to A$3.87 from
A$5.35. The stock was last at A$3.66. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
18:16 EDT - Boeing (BA) is feeling the sting of whistleblowers. The company is paying a $23M to settle
allegations that it overcharged on its maintenance work for the U.S. Air Force. The four former
employees who brought a false claims suit against the government will reap a $3.9M reward. For two of
the whistleblowers, the settlement marks the second time they are cashing in on Boeing allegations. In
2009, two of the whistleblowers were awarded $2.6M for a separate suit against Boeing.

18:10 EDT - Mark the date now, says Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne. On June 24,
2015, the company will unveil an all-new Alfa Romeo sedan, its first mass-market car to lead the
brand's revival in the U.S. and globally. Mr. Marchionne says the company has been working "quietly"
on the midsize car for last two years and its debut will kick of a barrage of new Alfa Romeo models set to
arrive in the next three years. Fiat Chrysler hopes to boost Alfa's global sales five-fold to over 500,000 by
2018. But as of now, it only sell a small, two-seater roadster with production limited to a couple thousand
a year. (christina.rogers@wsj.com)

18:01 EDT - Even as the California Public Employees' Retirement System retreats from hedge funds, its
staff is contemplating a push into another aggressive set of investments. Fixed income executives for the
nation's largest public pension fund told their investment board committee Monday they want to buy
riskier versions of "collateralized loan obligations," which are securities backed by corporate loans. The
plan already invests in triple-A rated slices of these securities. The move still needs to be approved by an
investment strategy group comprised of the fund's top investment officers. (dan.fitzpatrick@wsj.com)

17:54 EDT - Barclays Capital analyst Stephen Kim, a relative optimist earlier this year on the U.S.
home-building market, has reined in his forecasts for home construction and anticipates a sluggish
recovery through 2017. Mr. Kim says that persistent factors including high prices for newly built homes,
tight mortgage-lending standards and rising student debt are crimping demand. Meanwhile, he sees
new-home prices, after posting double-digit percentage gains in recent years, having peaked this year.
Going forward, Mr. Kim sees new-home prices as flat in 2015 in comparison with this year, down 3% in
2016 and down 5% in 2017. That, in turn, will squeeze home builders' profit margins. He foresees sales
volumes of new homes next year growing by no more than 10% to an estimated 1.1 million units.
