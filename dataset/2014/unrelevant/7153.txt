2353 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian share markets are likely to open higher as sentiment gets a lift from
positive U.S. markets overnight, says Macquarie Equities broker Brad Gordon. In both Australia and New
Zealand investors will be digesting company results. The NZX-50 is up 0.1% at 5156.998 and Gordon
says Australian futures are pointing to a positive open across the Tasman. He says a positive result from
both Spark (SPK.NZ) and Sky Television Network (SKT.NZ) will add to the positive mood. Spark is down
0.3% at NZ$2.90 but Gordon notes it had a strong run leading up to the result "and has managed to hold
up." Sky Television Network is up 1.4% at NZ$6.60. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

2348 GMT [Dow Jones] Twitter (TWTR) appeared to be proactively removing the gruesome images of
the death of a U.S. journalist in response to a request from his family. But the San Francisco company
isn't actively searching for the content itself. Instead, it will only remove the images if they are flagged by
users. That is the same process it had employed prior to a policy change announced Tuesday that now
allows family members to request images and videos of deceased individuals to be removed from TWTR.
The policy change comes amid two high profile incidents where users have begun to question the value
of allowing gratuitous content to exist on the service. TWTR's content policy has been more open than its
social media peers such as YouTube and Facebook (FB), which prohibit images of gratuitous violence
and pornography. But, like TWTR, they rely on users to report the insensitive content in order to review it
for removal. (Yoree.koh@wsj.com)

2353 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australia's biggest domestic story this week has been the comments about
China by Palmer United Party member of parliament Clive Palmer that were condemned by the
government and opposition. Palmer referred to Chinese as "bastards" who shoot their own people.
Palmer later tempered the remarks, saying they weren't aimed at either Chinese people in Australia or
the Chinese government. Westpac said there seems little danger of lasting damage to Australia-China
relations, noting the Xinhua, the state news agency, declared that "China and Australia share good
relations in different areas and on different levels" and are "on the verge of signing a historic Free Trade
Agreement. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

2351 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 should continue to trade cautiously before the Jackson
Hole central bankers' meeting this weekend. Having risen as much as 4.7% in the past two weeks, the
index pared most of its 0.8% intraday rise to a fresh 6-year high yesterday, as banks and resources
faded. While the S&P 500 hit a fresh record high overnight, short covering may have exaggerated the
rise before Jackson Hole speeches from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi.
Both are likely to emphasize the need for continued policy stimulus, but the Fed remain on track to lift
interest rates next year. Domestic earnings reports remain in focus, with Santos (STO.AU) among major
companies reporting Friday. Downgrades from analysts seem to be outweighing upgrades after
Thursday's reports. Index last 5638.9. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2346 GMT [Dow Jones] ASX (ASX.AU) delivered a largely in-line fiscal 2014 result but it highlights the
bourse has shown no EPS growth in three years despite a much healthier market environment, Bell
Potter says. In the last year earnings were impacted by a dilutive equity raising as well as a higher cost
base and some revenue weakness in certain divisions, Bell Potter notes. It adds ASX is still facing issues
with the slow emergence of competition, including cash-market volume decline, little growth from
derivatives volumes and the recent move to lower interest rate futures clearing fees. The listings and
capital raisings division is the highlight. Bell Potter retains a sell recommendation and raises its target to

2334 GMT [Dow Jones] The federal health law's marketplaces often didn't provide consumers a clear
picture of which doctors were included in health plans, according to a new Urban Institute analysis.
Researchers examined nine states and the federal site. Most didn't clearly tell consumers the type of
plan--such as HMO or PPO--and few included physician directories. Few of the insurers' own directories
allowed users to single out the network for the particular plan they wanted. That could be "exceptionally
misleading," since these plans might not include all the doctors in the insurers' full networks, the report
said. (Anna.Mathews@wsj.com)

2334 GMT [Dow Jones] With the U.S. dollar printing multimonth highs against many major currencies this
week, it is fair to ask how much longer the Australian dollar can outperform, Westpac said in a note to
clients. Multiyear lows on a basket of Australia's key commodity prices and softer Chinese growth
momentum flag a warning of a downside break, it adds. However, with the RBA still confident growth will
pick up in 2015, support remains in place, it adds. So long as US$0.9200 holds, Westpac says it will
remain neutral on the currency but lean toward selling any rallies to 0.9330/40 rather than buying dips.

2328 GMT [Dow Jones] Consumers are set to receive $7 billion in relief from Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) as part of the lender's record settlement with government agencies. That is more than the
combined relief awarded in similar settlements reached by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C). The relief to be provided by Bank of America includes reductions in mortgage principal and
monthly payments for consumers struggling to hold onto their homes, funds to take over and tear down
derelict housing and assistance for building or refurbishing affordable rental properties. The more
focused approach to consumer relief came after critics had said homeowner assistance in past
settlements wasn't targeted enough towards those hardest hit by the housing crisis.

2327 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse is skeptical that Origin Energy's (ORG.AU) A$24.7
billionAustralia Pacific LNG joint venture with ConocoPhillips (COP) will come in on time and budget,
noting that of the seven LNG projects to start construction since 2005, five were late, with an average
12-month delay. The project also appears to be burning cash quickly compared to BG Group's (BG.LN)
neighboring QCLNG project. "We are alarmed that with 18 months left, 75% complete, APLNG only has
15% of budget left," the broker says. "QCLNG, when 15 months out, had 32% left." That said, if Origin's
project bucks the trend, the share price should go higher. "We remain on the fence for now, retaining our
A$14.55/share target price and neutral recommendation." Origin was last at A$14.78.

2322 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter analyst Fred Truong expects BC Iron (BCI.AU) to miss its FY15 sales
goal after finding more lay than expected in some ore dug from its Nullagine iron-ore joint venture with
Fortescue Metals (FMG.AU). Truong has pencilled in annual shipments of 5.7 million tons of iron ore,
below the 5.8 million-6.2 million ton range targeted by Perth-based BC Iron. The broker also increased
its forecast FY15 unit costs to A$52/ton, which is at the upper end of BC Iron's guidance range of
A$49-A$53/ton. "This has led to a A$3 million, or 7%, downgrade to FY15 earnings," Truong says. Bell
Potter rates BC Iron a buy, with a A$3.80 price target. BC Iron, which is trying to acquire rival Iron Ore
Holdings (IOH.AU), last traded at A$3.00. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2310 GMT [Dow Jones] With insufficient upside expected for AMP (AMP.AU) shares despite a solid
first-half result, Citi lowers its stance to neutral from buy even as its price target rises to A$6.10/share
from A$5.90. It notes AMP's wealth protection division appears to be stabilizing, with division profit
margins set to rise in the second half and the full-year outlook considerably better than expected. Citi lifts
its EPS estimate for AMP by 1.7% to A$0.355 for 2014. AMP last traded at A$5.75.

2307 GMT [Dow Jones] Recent strength in Aussie iron ore miners is out of step with the lack of
significant recovery in spot iron ore prices, notes marketmatters.com.au principal Shawn Hickman.
"Since April 2014, the big Australian miners have rallied, under the weight of 'free money,' as spot iron
ore has fallen over 20%," Mr. Hickman says. "History tells us either the iron ore price needs to rally, or
the sector is due for a decent correction. A continued deterioration in (China's) property (market) can
only be detrimental to the iron ore price." Spot iron ore fell 0.4% to US$91.90 on Thursday.
