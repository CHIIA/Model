23:25 GMT [Dow Jones] Fonterra made a significant adjustment lower to its overall 12-month GDT
(global dairy trade) volume forecast last week, says Eric Meyer, an analyst with Chicago brokerage firm
HighGround Trading. He notes the 4.4% drop in the volume forecast was its sharpest downward revision
since September 2013 but "this does not necessarily mean prices are headed higher in the near term." If
China does not return as an "aggressive buyer" GDT prices could continue drifting in a narrow range
over the next two months, says Meyer. He also notes global milk supplies continue building at a sharply
higher rate versus last year and this will continue to weigh on the market.(rebecca.howard@wsj.com;

2325 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar has drifted lower on the back of warnings from the central
bank that the Aussie dollar remains overvalued, despite a sharp 6% fall through September. The Aussie
has fallen to around US$0.8750 from US$0.8765 since the remarks by RBA Assistant Governor Guy
Debelle that highlighted the fact that the Australian dollar must continue to slide to keep pace with falls in
key commodity prices like iron ore, which is down nearly 40% in 2014. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

2325 GMT [Dow Jones]--UBS analyst Nik Burns expects Chevron (CVX) will take part to a second phase
of exploration for unconventional gas in the Nappamerri Trough in central Australia with Beach Energy
(BPT.AU). Concerns around Chevron's ongoing commitment contributed to Beach Energy falling 16% in
the three months through September, making it the worst-performing stock among Australia's major
energy companies. Beach Energy says Chevron must decide whether to move to Stage 2 in the
Nappamerri Trough in Queensland state by March 31, which would trigger payments of US$77 million in
cash and US$41 million to cover Beach Energy's own exploration costs. UBS rates Beach Energy at
neutral, with a A$1.45/share price target. BPT last traded at A$1.30. (david.winning@wsj.com;

11:21 GMT [Dow Jones} Network executives have now had a few days to let a small error at
measurement firm Nielsen sink in. The upshot? The reissued ratings ticked down slightly for ABC but
increased slightly for the other big broadcasters. NBC's "The Voice," for example, saw its season
premiere grow from a rating of 3.9 to 4.1 in the crucial 18- to 49-year-old demographic, a person familiar
with the matter said. Importantly, Nielsen discovered and corrected its error before the scheduled release
of "C3" commercial ratings, which factor in live viewing plus three days of digital recording and form the
basis for advertising deals. The error therefore won't impact networks' bottom line, but will erode
confidence in Nielsen at a time when networks are already perturbed at the measurement firm, arguing
its figures understate networks' digital audience across mobile devices and tablets.

2322 GMT [Dow Jones] New Zealand's milk season is off to a strong start despite lower prices. In the
June to September period, milk collection was up 4.5% on the year, dairy giant Fonterra says. Milk
collection was up 3.9% in September versus the same month a year earlier. "Despite some unsettled
weather, favourable pasture growth in the North Island has helped maintain early season volumes above
last year's levels," Fonterra says. Volumes are approaching peak collection for the season, which is
forecast for mid-October 2014. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)
2322 GMT [Dow Jones]--Sentiment in the iron-ore market is vastly more bullish after strong Chinese
import data and robust demand from the world's No. 2 economy post-Golden Week holidays. But

back it up. "Further supportive Chinese data will be needed to sustain the overnight rally in iron ore as
yesterday's support from import figures is unlikely to linger," analysts at ANZ write in a note. Iron-ore
prices rose 4% Monday, to US$83.10/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones] The spot price for iron ore may well have bottomed for the year and could edge
back up to $95/ton, which make it opportune to buy or short-cover leveraged Australian iron-ore equities,
suggests Bell Potter Securities executive director Charlie Aitken. "Don't worry about analyst valuations or
any of that. They meant nothing on the way down and will mean nothing on the way back up," he says.
"This is about spot iron ore bottoming and iron-ore equities following the spot price as leveraged
derivatives of that spot price." Still, if investors are looking for stocks to sell, Aitken says they should
consider the energy sector as oil prices continue to fall sharply. Overall, he shifts his tactically bearish
stance on Australian equities to neutral. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones]--Morningstar remains upbeat about James Hardie's (JHX.AU) medium-term
earnings outlook and an improving operating environment, particularly as the U.S. housing market
improves. A key driver for the company is its cost advantage, which is underpinned by a commitment to
research and development that has delivered a number of patents on its leading products. The
investment-research firm expects the building materials company will file patent applications in the next
few years, extending its market leadership. "Competitors will be forced to spend more money on
manufacturing and material to compete effectively, which we do not envisage," analyst Tim Mann says.
Morningstar has a reduce recommendation and A$12/share fair-value estimate. JHX last traded at
A$11.28. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS lifts James Hardie Industries PLC (JHX.AU) from Sell to Neutral, citing
recent Australian dollar weakness and a positive outlook for the U.S. housing industry. The broker
estimates that every 1 cent move in the currency has added 0.8% to the company's Australian dollar
earnings, and says further falls are possible. UBS says U.S. housing starts are expected to grow by 15%
in the next two years. "Longer term, the millennials should boost starts as this age group moves out of
home." Lifts target price to A$12.25 ($10.63) from A$11.85. The stock last traded at A$11.28.

2318 GMT [Dow Jones]--Growthpoint Properties Australia (GOZ.AU) has limited headroom for
acquisitions, says UBS, which rates the stock at neutral. "We estimate Growthpoint Properties has
capacity to acquire around A$150 million additional assets before exceeding the maximum target
gearing of 45%," UBS says. If Growthpoint Properties spends A$100 million on acquisitions, UBS thinks
earnings would increase by around 1.3% in FY15 and 2.5% in FY16. That assumes a 7.4% yield and
4.5% incremental debt cost. UBS lifts Growthpoint Properties's price target by 4.9% to A$2.59/share.
GOZ last traded at A$2.65. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2235 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Australia's central bank said Tuesday a sharp decline in the Australian dollar
since early September will do some good for the economy, but the currency remains fundamentally
overvalued and needs to go lower. Guy Debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) at the Reserve
Bank of Australia, said a lower currency was needed to help the economy rebalance as a decadelong
mining investment boom fades and commodity prices tumble. "Australia's terms of trade has continued to
decline and some key commodity prices for Australia, most notably the iron ore price, have declined
considerably. On that basis, the Australian dollar is still higher than most conventional estimates of
fundamentals would indicate," Mr. Debelle said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

2233 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS downgrades SAI Global (SAI.AU) to neutral after the compliance-services
provider ends discussions with potential acquires for all or parts of the company. "In our opinion the
process over the past four months has highlighted a number of issues, none of which are positive for the
stock in our view," the broker says. These include the long absence of a CEO and slow progress
appointing a new one, earnings risk from the renegotiation of a major contract, and the removal of a
historical takeover premium priced into the stock. UBS slashes its price target on SAI to A$3.87 from
A$5.35. The stock was last at A$3.66. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
