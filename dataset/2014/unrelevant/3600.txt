Chinese buyers of seaborne cargoes returned to the spot market Friday after the Lunar New Year
break with sharply lower price expectations in view of rising port stocks and end-user stockpiles in
China, market sources said.
Buyers on China's eastern coast were more active than their counterparts in the north and south of the
country, on the first day's trading after the week-long Chinese holiday, said market sources.

"We won't start until next week," said a Beijing-based trader. "Utilities were only bidding Yuan
550-560/mt [CFR, including 17% VAT] before the holidays. They were not keen to restock for March."
Two buyers on China's eastern coast were in the market for Australian, maximum 23% ash, 5,500
kcal/kg NAR product for delivery in late March and early April, with indicative bids at $77.50-78/mt CFR
Kemen and Liuheng, as heard through broker Marex Spectron.

The April-arrival cargo bid for delivery to Kemen port had risen from $77/mt CFR earlier in the day.
Normalizing these prices to the south China port of Guangzhou would indicate buying interest at
$77-77.50/mt based on current freight rates of about $10/mt on the eastern Australia to south China
trading route.

Sellers were seeking $78.75-80/mt for April-arrival 5,500 kcal/kg NAR cargoes, said the broker.
A Singapore-based Chinese trader was heard attempting to resell at least three Capesize cargoes of
5,500 kcal/kg NAR Australian thermal coal at $80/mt CFR South China for April delivery.

"The price [of $80/mt CFR] is too high," another Singapore-based trader said. "No one would buy at
such a price."

Utilities pushing

A Fujian-based trader said he was not ready to take any new cargoes, as his utility customers were
pushing down very hard on purchase prices.

"We haven't spoken with our utility customers yet. But they were bidding at less than Yuan 560/mt
($92.mt) [CFR, including 17% VAT] before the holiday," he said.
The trader said his company did not currently expect to buy much thermal coal in March because of
lower electricity demand in China.
Industrial production in China traditionally dips going into the Chinese New Year holiday, and
coal-fired power generation has remained at low levels despite lower temperatures and snowfall in
northern China, said local market sources.

and for some plants their coal stocks are as high as 60 days' consumption, sources said.
It was a similar story at China's major coal ports, with Qinhuangdao port's stocks reportedly edging up
to 8.09 million mt Friday, from 7.63 million mt last weekend.
For Fangcheng port, an important intake point for imported thermal coal, stocks had risen 500,000 mt
since last week to more than 5 million mt, port sources said.

Qinhuangdao prices
In China's domestic thermal coal market, prices at Qinhuangdao port have continued to slide with
5,500 kcal/kg NAR product heard to trade at Yuan 560/mt FOB, and buying interest has dropped to as
low as Yuan 550/mt, said traders in China.
"I would expect a drop of about Yuan 20/mt in domestic thermal coal prices before the market bottoms
out," a Shandong-based trader said.
Meanwhile, in the FOB markets, some Indian interest was heard for mid-calorific value Australian coal
at $66.25/mt FOB Newcastle basis 5,500 kcal/kg NAR, higher than Chinese buyers whose bids were at
$66/mt FOB for March-loading and at $65.50/mt for April shipments out of Newcastle, according to
Marex Spectron.

Lower vessel freight and a desire on the part of Australian producers to diversify their customer base
were said to be the motivation for Indian buying interest at Newcastle port.
At the close of Asian trade Friday, the Platts/Fenwei China Coal Index (CCI 1) for domestic thermal
coal traded at Qinhuangdao port was assessed at Yuan 560/mt inclusive of VAT, down Yuan 4 from
the last price assessment before the Lunar New Year break on January 29.
Platts assessed the price of FOB Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal/kg NAR thermal coal, excluding VAT, for
delivery in the next 7-45 days at Yuan 480/mt, stable on the day.
The CFR South China (CCI 8) price was assessed at $77/mt basis 5,500 kcal/kg NAR, excluding
Chinese VAT, $1 lower than the last assessment on January 29.
Platts' price assessment for cargoes of 5,500 kcal/kg NAR imported thermal coal for arrival in south
China ports in the next 15-60 days was at $77.25/mt CFR Friday, steady day-on-day.
Typical 20% ash Newcastle 5,500 kcal/kg NAR coal for loading in the next 7-45 days was assessed at
$67.50/mt FOB, down 25 cents from the previous day.
