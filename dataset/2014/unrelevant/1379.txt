Despite only one initial public offering coming to the market in January, bankers and advisers are
still expecting that 2014 will become a bumper year for new listings.

After 2013 finished with a late rush of floats, 19 in December, Valence Industries was the only stock
to hit the boards in January. The graphite miner, previously Strategic Graphite, raised $6.7 million.

This year's slow start contrasts to January 2013 when seven companies listed on the ASX.

"This year has certainly opened up with a more cautious tone, but the IPO pipeline for 2014 is still
very robust," UBS executive director equity capital markets Richard Sleijpen said.

"Traditionally, January is very quiet," Mr Sleijpen said. "January 2013 was unusually busy due to a
market rally fuelled by the expansion of quantitative easing in the United States, but this year that is
being unwound."

The broad All Ordinaries index fell 3.1 per cent last month compared with a gain of 3.8 per cent in
January 2014.

Corporate advisers agreed that while the pipeline of market hopefuls remains strong, most are
holding off for better timing.

"For smaller companies in particular there is a lot of pressure to meet a minimum IPO subscription
and that is harder in a weak market," HLB Mann Judd partner Marcus Ohm said.

Mr Sleijpen said most companies with IPO plans are waiting until the February reporting season is
over to commence their formal marketing.
Confirmed coming IPOs include U&D Coal, China Mining , Simavita, and Cypress Gardens
Development Corp.

Australian Securities Exchange data released on Thursday showed after welcoming 33 new market
participants, debt and equity vehicles included, in December there were only three new entrants
overall in January.

However, the total amount of new capital raised by new players in January was nearly double at
$23 million, up from $11.8 million in December.
