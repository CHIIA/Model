The impact of savaging sinks in

The fall-out from the savaging of oil prices saw Australian LNG majors, Santos and Origin, reassuring
investors that financing and expenditure would be reconfigured and that the economics of their massive
projects still worked. Their response was credible enough to convince the market there was no impending
doom. But life for these companies has become tougher and the gloss is fading. Thus Thursday's
announcements were not sufficient to assuage investor concerns about the prospects for the energy
sector. And the market took a tumble in the absence of enough good news from elsewhere. The big
mining stocks drifted lower and a lift in Telstra's share price, when combined with sluggish performances
from the banks, wasn't enough to drag up the index. Origin has finessed its funding options, extending the
size of its facility and lengthening the repayment terms. It hosed down concerns that the effects on
returns, from the fall in the oil price, would be especially damaging, telling the market that at the $24.7
billionAustralia Pacific LNG project would throw off cash even when the oil price fell as low as US$40
($48) to US$45 per barrel. But it also said that its share of

distributable cash flow from APLNG is expected to average more than $900 million a year from the
2016-17 financial year - down from the estimate of about $US1billion a year that Origin gave in May this
year. Santos said on Thursday it had cut its 2015 capital expenditure from $2.7 billion to $2 billion as it
battens down the hatches to deal with the financial buffeting resulting from the oil dive by 40 per cent this
year. Despite their attempts to calm investor fears, the share prices of these and other Australian LNG

companies continue to take heavy fire. Santos in particular, which is considered the most exposed to the
falling price due to its higher debt levels, has been hit hard with its share price falling a further 6 per cent
on Thursday. The latest wave of oil price declines comes off the back of news that OPEC has cut its
demand forecast for next year and follows last week's news from OPEC had it would not reduce supply.
This has unbalanced the demand and supply equation further and sent international equity markets,
including Australia, into a tail spin.

Many Australian analysts are now suggesting the shares in the LNG producers have probably been
oversold.CIMB notes that equity markets are "clearly discounting the uncertainty unfolding around
supply- demand dynamics." But it reckons this and that price moves are typically amplified; and
fundamental drivers do resume. While true, it would be a brave call to wade into this uncertain territory. It
is fair to say that almost all experts did not predict the severity of the fall in oil prices and few would have
expected the producers would act irrationally and maintain supply in the
face of falling demand from the likes of China. However, the behaviour of those that produce iron ore
(they boosted production at a time of falling demand) provides a clear template demonstrating producers

OPEC appears set on crushing some of the new higher-cost oil shale output coming out of the US. The
iron ore majors such as Vale, BHP and Rio want to edge out the higher cost producers in developing
countries such as China, even if they are to take a short to medium-

term hit to their own returns. So, while producers play to their own agendas the fallout is becoming very
costly for countries that are net exporters of these commodities. Australia fits into that basket. Of course
there will be particular stocks and sectors in Australia that stand to gain from a falling oil price. The most
obvious contenders are transport and logistics stocks and the Qantas and Virgin share price graphs
illustrate this story. But for the Australian economy, a net exporter of energy, the wider negatives prevail
and this explains why the Australian dollar gets pushed down when the oil price falls.
