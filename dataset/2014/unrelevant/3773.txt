It is highly unusual for a private equity firm to enter a takeover battle for a listed company. But last
week ended with plenty of speculation Singaporean agribusiness Wilmar International could face
competition in its $1.3 billion bid for Goodman Fielder.
Wilmar already owns 10.1 per cent of Goodman and launched a 65¢ a share bid – along with Hong
Kong investment manager First Pacific – last Monday. Goodman described the offer as "undervalued"
and "opportunistic", but indicated it would be willing to negotiate and appointed investment bank Credit
Suisse as an adviser.

However, it is understood that private equity firm PEP is weighing up its options. PEP is familiar with
the maker of Wonder White bread and Meadowlea margarine having made an unsuccessful
$3.6 billion bid with Bain Capital in 2005 back when Goodman was owned by Burns Philp.

Market sources said PEP had sounded out advisers for a potential tilt. With UBS working for Wilmar,
Citigroup is seen as the most logical candidate. For their part, sources close to PEP claim it is more a
case of investment banks pitching a rival bid to them.
Whatever the case, it is no surprise PEP is interested. The firm has raised $1.1 billion for a fifth fund
and is on the hunt for new investments as it sells out of assets such as industrial services group
Spotless and cinema operator Hoyts.

Whether or not PEP's interest turns into a concrete offer remains to be seen. Not only are private
equity firms reluctant to get into listed takeover wars, but PEP also faces the issue of Wilmar owning
that 10.1 per cent stake. Wilmar secured the shareholding more than two years ago, giving it the ability
to block any rival bid for full control. The main game, of course, remains the bid that is actually on the
table. The Wilmar/First Pacific team are, by all accounts, getting increasingly frustrated about what
they describe as a lack of engagement by the Goodman side.

The offer was well timed given Goodman announced yet another earnings downgrade – the fourth in
the past three years – on April 2.
Elsewhere, ASX-listed junior platinum explorer Nkwe Platinum has finalised $20 million funding with
Chinese investor, Jin Jiang Mining.
Jin Jiang has purchased $20 million of three-year convertible bonds, which will be immediately
converted to 202.6 million Nkwe shares to improve the company's balance sheet.

Nkwe will use the funds to develop its South African Garatu mining project. An announcement is
expected as early as Monday.
