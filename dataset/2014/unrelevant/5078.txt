Australia's Gindalbie Metals produced 1.26 million mt of magnetite from its Karara joint venture in
July-September, up 35.5% from April-June, the company said Thursday.

The magnetite quality averaged 66.2% Fe and 6.9% silica, which compares with magnetite production
quality averaging 65.4% Fe and 6.3% silica during the June quarter, Gindalbie said.

Gindalbie shipped 1.04 million mt of hematite direct shipping ore from Karara in July-September,
down slightly from 1.14 million mt in the previous quarter. A total of 35 shipments were made during
the September quarter totaling 2.18 million mt of combined magnetite and hematite DSO.

The Karara project, located 225 km (140 miles) east of Geraldton in Western Australia's Mid West
region, has a production capacity of 8.8 million mt/year. The plant has not reached maximum capacity
since it began operating in January 2013 due to ongoing commissioning problems and technical faults.

Gindalbie said it is continuing to review how to improve Karara production. "Given the ongoing work to
assess and improve the production capacity and performance of the Karara operation, the Gindalbie
board is not in a position to provide guidance or forecast when the project will achieve positive cash
flow," it said.
Gindalbie is also developing the Hinge iron ore project, located 23 km northeast of Karara.
Hinge will produce 3.5 million mt of hematite ore over an 18-month period. The ore will be crushed
and screened at Hinge, then trucked to the existing rail load-out facility located at Karara.
Commissioning of the project is already underway and Gindalbie expect to deliver first ore to Karara
during the December quarter, it said.
Karara is a JV between Gindalbie (47.84%) and China's Ansteel (52.16%). Ansteel also holds the right
to increase its stake further to 62% if it is required to repay additional bank debt and concentrate
pre-sales agreements totaling $230 million.
