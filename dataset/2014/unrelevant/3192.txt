2300 GMT [Dow Jones]--Westpac Banking's (WBC.AU) third-quarter capital update indicates its
asset-quality metrics continue to improve and domestic housing-credit growth has returned to the levels
of the wider financial system, says J.P. Morgan. On the back of that, the brokerage is nudging up its
fiscal 2014 earnings forecast by slightly less than 1% to just under A$7.6 billion--which still leaves it
modestly below consensus. It remains overweight and raised its price target to A$35.38/share from
A$34.99. WBC last traded at A$34.88. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2249 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter executive director Charlie Aitken upgrades Fortescue (FMG.AU) to a
High Conviction Buy from Buy. "Fortescue now meets all my criteria of being value, having
underperformed, being heavily shorted (15.8% of free float), dividend growth, earnings upgrades, a U.S.
dollar earner, China facing yet with clear catalysts for re-rating," Mr. Aitken says. Target price is A$5.77.
FMG last A$4.55. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

10:42 GMT [Dow Jones] Total job advertising fell a seasonally adjusted 2.7% in July, "unwinding much of
June's lift. Momentum has cooled in recent months," according to the ANZ monthly job ads survey.
Nationwide Internet job advertising fell 1.9% in July while newspaper job advertising fell 8.0% in July.
The "level of job advertising is consistent with continuing but more modest employment growth. We
expect the unemployment rate to edge under 5.5% by year's end," says ANZ Economist Sharon Zollner.

2240 GMT [Dow Jones] Argentina's economy shrank 2.3% in July from the same month a year ago, says
Orlando J Ferreres & Asociados, a leading consulting firm. In the first seven months of the year, the
economy contracted 1.1% from the same period in 2013. OJF's estimate is more pessimistic than that
presented by Argentina's Economy Ministry, whose data are questioned by economists. The ministry
said economic activity was unchanged in June, for instance, while OJF said it had shrunk 0.6%. The
ministry won't publish its July data until next month. Whatever the case, most economists expect the
economy to shrink sharply in 2014. (taos.turner@wsj.com; @taos)

2235 GMT [Dow Jones] Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AU) may be paying out 80% of its profits as
dividends, but RBC Capital Markets poses a question: are capex options emerging? The broker says the
outlook has changed since Woodside's 2Q update. Notably, the Browse LNG project offshore Western
Australia state continues to edge closer to a decision on whether to start early design work, possibly
around the end of 2H 2014, while new options have emerged in Canada at Grassy Point and Kitimat
where Apache (APA) and a number of other oil companies are actively seeking buyers for some assets.
"We suggest it's possible Woodside could reenter a significant capex draw phase from end 2015," RBC
says. The broker rates Woodside at underperform with a A$43.00 price target. WPL last traded at
A$43.38. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
18:33 EDT - Google Capital, the growth equity investment arm of Google (GOOGL), led a $100M
investment in San Francisco-based services marketplace startup Thumbtack, done at a valuation around
$800M. The deal is the latest move by the search giant to connect with interesting technologies through
targeted investment vehicles. Google Capital, formed last year, has made a half-dozen investments so
far across a variety of industries. Another Google investment arm, Google Ventures, backs earlier-stage
startups. (lizette.chapman@wsj.com)

stronger global economic growth. "We believe the strategy to drive increased asset utilization, thereby
increasing operating cash-flows to reinvest in growth opportunities and its focus on improving its Return
on Capital Employed to 20% by FY19 is sound," the broker says. "In the short term, though, this may
lead to some margin compression." Target rises to A$9.77 from A$9.41. BXB last A$9.33.

18:28 EDT - H-P (HPQ) gives investors a little mystery to stew over. On its earnings conference call
Wednesday, HPQ says its ability to do share buybacks was limited in the quarter ended July 31 "due to
material non-public information." An HPQ spokeswoman declined to say whether that was a reference to
an acquisition the company was trying to do, or some other event that legally restricted HPQ from
stock repurchases. (shira.Ovide@wsj.com; @ShiraOvide)
18:14 EDT - Boston private-equity firmBain Capital takes a 50% stake in TOMS Shoes, a company
that sells shoes, eyewear, sunglasses and coffee. TOMS' founder, Blake Mycoskie, will continue to own
50% of the company. Founded in 2006, TOMS is known for its charitable program, "One for One," which
donates a pair of shoes or a pair of eyeglasses for every pair bought, or provides one week of clean
water to a person in need for every bag of coffee purchased. P-E firms continue to seek opportunities in
the retail and consumer sector. There have been 28 sponsor-backed deals in apparel and accessories
this year, valued at approximately $1.5B, Dealogic reports. Bain already owns Gymboree and Canada
Goose.(lillian.rizzo@wsj.com)

18:01 EDT - H-P (HPQ) says they're trying to take advantage of an ownership transition at rival IBM
(IBM). HPQ CEO Meg Whitman says her company "moved aggressively to take advantage of the
uncertainty customers feel" about Lenovo's pending acquisition of IBM's mass-market server business.
HPQ's division that includes computer servers posted a 2% revenue increase for the quarter ended July
31. HPQ shares ended down 1% to $35.12. (shira.ovide@wsj.com; @ShiraOvide)

17:58 EDT - The outfit that manages the electric grid for much of the East and parts of the Midwest, PJM
Interconnection, wants to beef up regional electricity supplies. It's proposing that electricity generators
capable of running a minimum of 16 hours a day for at least three days be eligible for special "capacity"
payments. They'd need to demonstrate they have fuel supplies locked down. PJM says it's worried
because up to 22 percent of its generating capacity was unavailable last winter amid weather-related
problems, including fuel shortages. The proposal is good news for power companies that have been
complaining about low prices for electricity. (rebecca.smith@wsj.com)

17:54 EDT - With the Dow and S&P both closing slightly higher, expect a reasonably positive start to
equity markets in Asian, says Craigs Investment Partners broker Andrew Cathie in Wellington. He adds
locally strong results from bellwether stocks Fletcher Building (FBU.NZ) and Freightways (FRE.NZ)
should also provide support for the market. He says a further softening of the NZD could support Fisher
& Paykel Healthcare (FPH.NZ), which increased its guidance for fiscal 2014. The NZX-50 ended up
0.5% or 26 points to 5140.338. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)
