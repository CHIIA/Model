*Superannuation benefit payouts rose to a record $75 billion last year, as baby boomers drew down their
savings to fund their retirement, APRA reported in its annual report.
While total super contributions fell 2% to $115.3 billion in the 12 months to June last year, withdrawals
rose 4.6% to $74.5 billion.

before.

Rising super payouts, a trend likely to accelerate as the populatoin ages, are expected to put pressure on
super funds to maintain sufficient levels of assets that can be readily sold.

*FSF/Other: Danone to sue Fonterra over whey scare - Sky News

Sky News reports Danone, the world's biggest yoghurt maker, has launched legal proceedings against
Fonterra over last year's whey protein concentrate recall and ended its existing supply contract with the
New Zealand dairy exporter.
The Paris-based food processing company is initiating proceedings in the New Zealand High Court and
arbitration proceedings in Singapore 'to bring all facts to light and to obtain compensation for the harm it
has suffered,' it said in a statement.
Danone put the cost of last year's WPC 80 recall at 350 million euros ($NZ575.33m, $A539.99m) when it
announced its third-quarter results, while Auckland-based Fonterra recognised a contingent liability of just
$14m in its own accounts.

Last August, Fonterra quarantined several batches of whey protein concentrate amid fears it was
contaminated with a potentially dangerous form of the clostridium bacteria.

The whey protein was ultimately cleared as a false alarm.

Danone will also terminate existing supply contract with Fonterra and make 'any further collaboration
contingent on a commitment by its supplier to full transparency and compliance with the cutting-edge food
safety procedures applied to all products supplied,' it said.
Of the eight customers affected by Fonterra's recall, the New Zealand company agreed to a commercial
outcome with all of them except Danone, including extending supply contracts for the next 10 years and
agreeing to volume increases.

In December, Fonterra chief executive Theo Spierings said he expected any court action would show the
New Zealand company has no liability in its contract, Sky News reported.
