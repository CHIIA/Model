Dairy industry has broadly welcomed the China Australia Free Trade Agreement with qualifications
about future investment, concerns about currency manipulation and questions about monitoring
implementation.

Major producers and rural organisations claim it will create better trade conditions for competing in
China against major exporting rivals, such as New Zealand. It is also anticipated the changes
will flow on to related products, such as cheese, milk powder and packaged milk.

"We hope to see it come into force quickly," said Noel Campbell, chair of the Australian Dairy
Industry Council, which co-ordinates industry policy and represents local and international policy.
Last year, Australia exported more than 109,000 tonnes of dairy product worth about $461 million to
China, 16 per cent of total Australian dairy exports by value.

Major producers, such as Devondale Murray Goulburn, whose exports last year accounted for just
over half of revenues, said it has to review the detail.
"China is already the world's largest dairy import market," said managing director Gary Helou. Last
year's imports of 2.2 million tonnes were an increase of more than 40 per cent on the previous
year.Concerns over Chinese buying local farms
"It is important that Australia has competitive access to the China market," he added. A lot of
farmers, particularly in the Gippsland region of south-east Victoria, are more cautious in their outlook.
While welcoming the prospect of increased exports, they are concerned about Chinese investors
buying up local farms and then exporting milk products directly to be processed in China and then
sold back to Australia.
Many are concerned about the inactivity of the Foreign Investment Review Board in monitoring the
build-up of major stakes, often through Australian-based proxies.

There are also concerns about entering long-term trading relationships with a country that currency
experts claim deliberately suppresses the value of its currency to boost exports.

The Victorian Farmers Federation is confident it will boost local processing.
"The Victorian processing sector has committed more than $1 billion to upgrade processing capacity
and this deal will help us realise our potential," added president Tyran Jones.
More than 90 per cent of China's Australian dairy imports come from Victoria.
