A CHINESE investor has acquired a CBD office building for $1.3 million. Formerly a church, the
property at 142 Wright St comprises 200sqm of office space on a 359sqm site, including a car park.
CBRE’s Will Brown and Ben Heritage negotiated the sale of the property on behalf of a member of the
Lester Group of Companies. “This sale is further evidence of sustained interest from Chinese investors
wanting to secure sites within the CBD,” Mr Brown said.
