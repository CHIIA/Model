2357 GMT [Dow Jones]--Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AU) looks challenged in the short term with
rangebound coal prices and a strong Australian dollar, but Macquarie sees plenty of signs for optimism.
"We see a recovery driven by increased production from largely fixed-cost operations and a reduction in
onerous take-or-pay obligations," the broker says of Whitehaven's medium-term prospects. Whitehaven's
share of coal output at its mines totaled 2.08 million tons in 4Q, up 19% on year."We have increased
our FY14 earnings forecast from (a loss of) A$32 million to (a loss of) A$27 million as we factor in
increased realized pricing and production from largely fixed cost base assets," Macquarie says. It rates
Whitehaven at outperform with a A$1.70 price target. WHC last traded at A$1.55.

This market talk snippet was corrected at 10:18 p.m. DST. Thwe original misstated Macquarie's FY14
forecast for Whitehaven.

2356 GMT [Dow Jones] While there are some "left field" proposals in the interim report looking into
Australia's financial system that would be negative for the major banks, there is little change of them
being implemented, suggests Deutsche Bank. It notes the report found the banking sector is already well
regulated and capital ratios are in line with global peers. Still, there are some options presented in the
report that could benefit regional lenders, including allowing them to adopt internal ratings-based
modeling for mortgages. For Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd. (BEN.AU), that could be worth
A$0.50-A$1.40 ($0.50-$1.31) a share in net present value and A$1-A$2.40 a share for Bank of
Queensland Ltd. (BOQ.AU), Deutsche Bank estimates. "Critically the report does not call for a radical
reform but rather a refresh of the existing approach to prepare for future challenges."

7:56 p.m. EDT [Dow Jones]--Offshore accounts at five foreign brokerages place net sell orders for 3.1
million Japanese shares overnight, according to traders. The 6th consecutive day of premarket selling
may be negative for the market at the open, although the yen value basis of the figures is unknown. Sell
orders total 10.6 million shares, with buy orders amounting to 7.5 million shares.

2356 GMT [Dow Jones]--If there's an area of concern for Australia's banks in the government's interim
report from a financial-system inquiry, it lies in the specter of "too big to fail," says Macquarie. At a bulky
460 pages, the report offers options rather than recommendations and will be followed by further
consultations before a final report is due in November. Still, the section on "too big to fail" includes such
options as making big banks hold additional capital, ringfencing their retail operations, greater powers
for regulators and the ability to impose losses on creditors in the event of an institutional failure,
Macquarie says. All things being equal, it estimates the consequence such moves could have on ratings
and funding costs could lead to a 3%-5% hit to earnings. Still, Macquarie adds that would be over time
and could be mitigated by the banks. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2354 GMT [Dow Jones]--Nymex crude is likely to consolidate with risks skewed to the downside
near-term after hitting a two-month low of $99.01/bbl Tuesday as long as it stays below Monday's high of
$101.20, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is negative-biased as the
five- and 15-day moving averages are declining, the MACD indicator is bearish; but the slow stochastic

Page21of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.measure is at the oversold level. A drop below the $99.01 support would target $98.91 (May 5 low), then
$98.74 (May 1 swing low), $98.25 (March 21 reaction low) and $97.37 (March 17 swing low). But a rise
above $101.20 would temper the negative near-term view, exposing the upside to $103.00 (Thursday's
high), then to the 55-day moving average (now at $103.22), $103.60 (July 9 high) and $104.20 (July 8
high). August crude is up 16 cents at $100.12/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2350 GMT [Dow Jones]--OZ Minerals (OZL.AU) is burning through cash to keep production high, and
Credit Suisse worries this is putting intolerable pressure on the company's dividend. While output of
22,181 tons of copper in the June quarter was 14% above the broker's estimates, it didn't mask the bad
news that OZ Minerals expects full-year free cash flow to be negative. Credit Suisse isn't expecting cash
flow to turn positive in 2015 either. As a result, it has cut its dividend forecast by 50% to 10 cents. Credit
Suisse rates OZ Minerals at underperform with a A$3.80 price target. OZL last traded at A$4.30.
(david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2338 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Bank keeps its Sell rating on OZ Minerals (OZL.AU) as the miner
remains above a revised target price of A$3.40, and stronger 1H production was offset by declining cash
flow. "Cash outflows continue and the Company no longer expects a cash neutral outcome for 2014,"
the broker says. "Whilst working capital swings can be significant, the considerable build in ore
inventories consumes cash over the next few years." (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:
@DavidRogersWSJ)

2338 GMT [Dow Jones]--Nine Entertainment (NEC.AU) is a natural predator within Australia's media
industry, says Macquarie. Nine has a strong balance sheet, relatively clean position as an owner of TV
and online media, strong TV ratings, and can deliver potential savings through its Nine Events unit. Its
likely prey Southern Cross Media (SXL.AU) looks especially tasty. A deal at 9.5 times Southern Cross's
earnings could be 28.3% accretive to Nine, Macquarie says. That implies a A$1.46/share price for SXL,
above its last traded price of A$1.15. Macquarie rates Nine at outperform with a A$2.50 price target.
NEC last traded at A$2.09. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

23:21 GMT [Dow Jones] Sovereign wealth funds allocated $139.6B to the 25 largest alternative
managers in 2013, up from $126.6B in 2012, in an indication of the growing appetite for hedge funds,
private equity, real estate and infrastructure, data from consulting firmTowers Watson show. Of the total
commitments that sovereign wealth funds made to the managers in each year, private equity's share
increased to 33% in 2013 from 28% in the year-ago period, the data indicate. Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, which invests funds on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi, for instance, signaled in its
2013 investment report that it planned to grow its infrastructure and P-E teams in 2014.

7:21 p.m. EDT [Dow Jones]--The Australian Financial System Inquiry is likely to recommend measures
which further increase the capital requirements for the major banks, especially around the "too big to fail"
issue, UBS analysts Jonathan Mott and Adam Lee say. "Banks with strong organic capital generation
(Westpac and Commonwealth) are better placed, although they may be relatively disadvantaged by
higher mortgage risk weights," the broker says. "There may be some benefit for the regional banks with
the final recommendations due in November." (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY looks set to remain top-heavy and likely move in the
101.00-102.00 range during Asia trading, says Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities. After
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen comments, "dollar buying pressure is increasing, but
that is not strong enough to allow the pair to step out of the prevailing range," says Mr. Ishikawa.
Technically, the pair may find it difficult to surpass the 102.00 line, as the level is sandwiched between
two crucial resistance lines (200-day moving average of 101.94 and 120-day moving average of 102.10)
In addition, a slew of dollar selling orders is placed around 101.80-102.00. Fears about valuation of U.S.
stocks also are keeping a lid on gains in the USD/JPY. The pair is at 101.67 against 101.68 in New York
late Tuesday. The EUR/USD is tipped in a 1.3550-1.3650 range. It is at 1.3568.

"Mulally Is First New Google Director Since 2005 -- Market Talk," published at 6:59 p.m. EDT, incorrectly
said in the headline that Alan Mulally was the first new Google director since 2005. He is the second.

"Macquarie Sees Signs of Recovery for Whitehaven -- Market Talk," at 2357 GMT, misstated
Macquarie's FY14 forecast for Whitehaven. The quote should read "We have increased our FY14
earnings forecast from (a loss of) A$32 million to (a loss of) A$27 million as we factor in increased
realized pricing and production from largely fixed cost base assets," Macquarie says.
0000 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is expected to be flat before China releases GDP,
industrial production, retail sales and fixed assets investment data at 0200 GMT. Overnight, the S&P 500
fell 0.2% after Fed chief Janet Yellen said valuations in lower rated corporate debt "appear stretched",
pushing internet and biotech stocks down, even as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan rose on better than
expected earnings reports. Intel is up 4% after hours after beating earnings estimate, while Yahoo is
down 2.2%. Concern about stretched valuations in US internet and biotech stocks shouldn't affect
Australia unless they trigger a substantial fall in the S&P 500. The overall message that the Fed is in no
rush to lift interest rates is positive for equities, IG strategist Evan Lucas says. (david.rogers@wsj.com;
