Woolies drags market lower with disappointing sales figures

Stocks Sally Rose

Another record profit from Australia's second-largest bank and more monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan were not enough to buoy the sharemarket, as Woolworths disappointed investors with its worst
quarterly sales update in more than four years. The S&P/ASX 200 Index and the All Ordinaries Index
each fell 0.4 per cent on Monday to 5506.9 points and 5485 points respectively. The market declined
despite a strong lead from offshore. Equity markets in the US and Europe posted strong gains on Friday
night

after the Bank of Japan shocked markets with a move to increase the pace of its quantitative easing to
ï¿½80trillion a year, compared to a previous maximum of ï¿½70 trillion.
Some lacklustre company news and disappointing domestic and Chinese economic data meant the
market got little benefit from the positive sentiment about Japan's expansionary monetary policy. Bureau
of Statistics data showed building approvals dived 11 per cent in September, against expectations for a 1
per cent fall. The Reserve Bank is expected to

keep rates on hold at their record- low 2.5 per cent when the board meets on Tuesday. A swag of private
economic surveys indicated house price growth is moderating, the labour market is strengthening and
inflation is edging up. Westpac dropped 0.7 per cent to $34.55 as it reported a 8 per cent jump in net
profit for the year to September 30 to $7.6 billion. Westpac lifted its full-year dividend from 88ï¿½ to
92ï¿½ a share, fully franked. ANZ and National Australia Bank both delivered annual results in line with
forecasts last week. On Monday ANZ added 0.2 per cent to $33.58, while NAB fell 0.3 per cent to
$34.89.

Commonwealth Bank edged up 0.1per cent to $80.52. Woolworths dropped 4.9 per cent to $34.24 after
the retailer showed September-quarter sales rose by just 3 per cent, the slowest quarterly rate in more
than four years. Main rival Wesfarmers, owner of Bunnings and Coles, edged up 1ï¿½ to $44.15. Telstra
lifted 0.7 per cent to $5.67. Brambles rose 0.7 per cent to $9.60 as the logistics group reported a 6per
cent rise in sales for the September quarter and raised its full-year earnings guidance. BHP Billiton lost
0.7 per cent to $33.71, while Rio Tinto dropped 1 per cent to $59.78.
