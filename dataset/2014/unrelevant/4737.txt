SHANGHAI, June 24, SinoCast -- Foreign media said that Australia has approved plans of Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) to exploit a magnetite in West Australia with an operational period longer than
40 years.

FMG and Baosteel Group will carry produced magnetite to Port Headland and then export to Asia. The
Chinese steel-maker holds a minority stake in the project.

Last August, Formosa Plastics Group from Taiwan agreed to spend USD 1.15 billion in getting a 31%
stake in the magnetite, whose iron ores will be supplied to its steel plant in Vietnam that is scheduled to
start production in 2015.
