* Private funds look for bargains in struggling mining sector

* Say they can cut costs on promising projects

* But analysts warn could be difficult to make robust returns

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Private funds are trawling for bargains in Australia in the aftermath
of a global mining boom, looking to strip the fat at companies and projects they believe hold promise
but which are struggling under the weight of sagging commodity prices.
Big name funds that dominate the $2.5 trillion private equity industry generally steer clear of mining
which they see as too risky, but a clutch of specialist funds estimated to have at least $10 billion to
invest are on the prowl for opportunities around the world.

Most of those funds have focused on snaring assets in Africa and Latin America, shunning Australia
due to its higher costs. But some, like Resource Capital Funds, Royalty Stream Investments and
Denham Capital, say they see ways to build and run operations more tightly, reaping advantages from
Australia's relative proximity to China.

"We're working through this landscape of broken companies and mothballed projects," said Bert Koth,
managing director at Denham, an energy and mining private equity firm with more than $7 billion
already invested globally which set up an office in Perth last year.
Costs in Australia soared over the past decade, with mining and energy companies spending billions
of dollars to build new projects as they raced to supply China, driving up prices for manpower,
equipment and fuel.

Miners big and small were able to afford those costs as commodity prices climbed to record highs, but
most are now frantically cutting back as markets have become oversupplied and prices have tumbled.

In an industry starved for capital from top to bottom, bankers and analysts agree that cashed up private
funds could pick up assets cheaply and inject some extra capital to improve operations. But they warn
it could be difficult to make robust returns.

"The question is when you put the whole package together, including the costs to export, is it going to
be good enough on a total return? That's a lot more difficult," said Lawrence Grech, head of research
at PhillipCapital in Sydney.

NOT SO BAD
Former BHP Billitonexecutive Alberto Calderon, who left the mining giant earlier this year, sees good
prospects in base metals. He recently invested with Royalty Stream Investments in a Northern Territory
bauxite project run by privately owned Gulf Alumina and is also eyeing investments in mining
technology.

opportunities," he said.
Denham's Koth said his firm had recently backed two teams of seasoned mining executives with up to
$200 million each, looking to "take back the cost excesses of the mining boom step by step".
One, Pembroke Resources, is hunting for metallurgical coal projects in Australia, while the other,
Auctus Minerals, is scouting for non-coal assets.
Pembroke and Auctus are led by executives who successfully delivered mining projects and ran mines
in Australia when commodity prices were much weaker than now.

Auctus Managing Director Stephen Murdoch said current prices look low to executives in charge of
companies during the boom, but are far higher than when he was running mines over a decade ago
with copper at 55 cents a pound, versus around $3 now.
Auctus expects to seal its first acquisition within six months, said Murdoch, who rescued a costly
magnetite iron ore project as chief executive of Karara Mining.
Pembroke, under former Gloucester Coal chief Barry Tudor, is focused on finding high quality
metallurgical coal assets in Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia.
Tudor is confident he can pull off another success like he did at Gloucester, a 5 million tonnes a year
coal producer that was taken over by Chinese-controlled Yancoal Australia Ltd three years ago in a
deal worth about A$2 billion.
But Koth said there was no rush to buy coal assets.

"We actually believe the market is going to deteriorate further," he said. (Editing by Joseph Radford)
