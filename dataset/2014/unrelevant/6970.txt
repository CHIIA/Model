Shamrocker's first foal among crack Japanese sale

THE first foal of Australia's Champion 3YO Filly Shamrocker will go under the hammer in Japan on
Tuesday.

Shamrocker was one of five Group 1 winning mares that left for Japan in February last year along
with Southern Speed, Mosheen, King's Rose and Australasian Oaks winner, Absolutely.

All bar Absolutely were served by Japan's two-times Horse of the Year and Hall of Famer, Deep
Impact.
Shamrocker's bay filly by Deep Impact is one of 200 foals catalogued for the JHRA Select sale held at
Northern Horse Park.
The 2013 sale averaged approximately $347,000.

Another highly-sought after Deep Impact foal with an Australian link on offer next week is Lot 403, a
colt out of Azeri.

Azeri won 17 races and was USA Horse of the Year as well as the nation's threetimes Champion
Older Mare.

Azeri is a daughter of Jade Hunter from Zodiac Miss who was trained by David Hayes for the late USA
owner/ breeder, Allen Paulson.
Zodiac Miss won three of her eight starts highlighted by Group 3 NJC CocaCola Classic (1200m) at
Newcastle nine weeks after she was runner-up in Clan O'Sullivan's Magic Millions 2YO Classic on the
Gold Coast.
Azeri has so far foaled four winners led by Wine Princess (by Ghostzapper) who won the Grade 2
Falls City Handicap at Churchill Downs in 2013.
Meanwhile, Japanese turf idol Lord Kanaloa, winner of the past two Group 1 Hong Kong Sprints, was
voted the 'Most Admired Overseas Horse of the Year at the HKJC gala to end the current racing
season last Sunday.
His success in the Territory coincides with the JBBA launching an 'Incentive Bonus Scheme' in Hong
Kong to promote Japanese-bred horses and Japanese auction sales.

A similar scheme already exists in Singapore.
