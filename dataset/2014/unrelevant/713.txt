Australia's Cape Lambert Resources is lending Timis Mining Corporation $20 million to help fund the
acquisition of London Mining's Marampa mine assets in Sierra Leone, the Perth-based company said
Wednesday.
UK-based Timis Mining, a privately-owned company run by the chairman of African Minerals Frank
Timis, has not disclosed a final acquisition fee for London Mining. African Minerals operates the larger
Tonkolili iron ore mine, expected to produce 16 million-18 million mt in 2014, which is near London
Mining's 5 million mt/year concentrate operation.

The funding will include an $8 million 12-month bridging loan to Timis Mining, plus a $12 million
royalty agreement, which would earn Cape Lambert $2/mt on exports of concentrate for four years, paid
quarterly.
"While we believe that African Minerals is the natural acquirer of London Mining's assets, given its
significant infrastructure in the region and the transport cost savings it can thereby realize for the
Marampa operation," investment bank Investec said in a note. "It is interesting that it is Timis' private
company purportedly doing the bidding, perhaps because it can more readily realize the funding to
make the offer. However, we wonder what this may cost Africa Minerals shareholders in the long run," it
added.
The deal is subject to Timis Mining buying London Mining out of administration, which it entered
October 16 citing cash flow problems on weaker iron ore prices. Administrator PwC has been seeking a
buyer for London Mining's project. "There is no guarantee that Timis Mining will get Marampa, but it
certainly means that there will be another offer on the table for the administrator," Investec said.
Interest in Marampa was earlier heard to have come from India's JSW Steel. London Mining two weeks
ago said proposed structures being discussed with potential strategic investors for Marampa would not
leave any value for shareholders and it was unable to get further short-term funding from lenders. The
company sought "significant" investor capital with proposals contemplating funding life of mine
expansion and a cash injection to allow Marampa to continue operating.
Cape Lambert chairman Tony Sage said Marampa was expected to produce 5 million-7 million
mt/year and could generate annual earnings of $10 million-14 million. Cape Lambert owns 100% of a
nearby hematite iron ore project, also called Marampa, which is being developed as a 15 million
mt/year production capacity operation.
Late last year, Cape Lambert struck a deal to transport and export 2 million mt/year of concentrate on
African Minerals' rail and port facilities. African Minerals also has an option to buy 2 million mt/year at
the mine gate in the first three years of production at Cape Lambert's Marampa.

Marampa project had been "earmarked for sale." It owns a number of other iron ore projects in West
Africa, including Kukuna and Rokel in Sierra Leone, and Sandenia in Guinea.
