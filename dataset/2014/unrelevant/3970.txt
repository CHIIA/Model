Australia's TreasuryWine Estates receives two multibillion-dollar offers as it struggles against
low-priced competition
The Australian maker of well-known wine brands including Penfolds, Beringer, Lindeman's and Wolf
Blass is the subject of a multibillion-dollar takeover battle as it fends off a glut of low-priced
competition.

Melbourne-based Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. has been struggling for a couple of years, particularly in
the United States, the world's largest market for wine imports, as it faces a global oversupply of
low-priced Australian and southern French wine. Last year, the company was forced to destroy
thousands of gallons of product past its drink-by date, leading to a $160-million Australian
($162million Canadian) writedown for 2013.

On Monday, the struggling vintner announced it had received a second offer from an unnamed bidder
to acquire the company for approximately $3.38-billion (Australian) or $5.20 a share. The new,
non-binding offer matches one made by New York private equity firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
LP in partnership with Rhône Capital last week.

According to reports, the new bidder is Fort Worth, Tex.-based TPG Capital.
Whichever firm wins, observers suggest they could turn a profit either by spinning off the
better-performing parts of the business, or by refocusing the marketing of brands that many say have
become undervalued. Treasury Wine Estates, KKR and TPG Capital all declined to comment.

“You have properties such as Chateau St. Jean, it's doing a pretty good job … On the flipside you
have something like Meridian, which they have allowed to degenerate," said Tony Correia, founder of
industry consultancy Correia Company. That is despite the fact that the Santa Barbara-based brand
historically turned out decent wines, and had some cachet. “… It's on the shelves in the [U.S.] grocery
stores, and it's always the subject of some two-for-one sale."
Beringer, too, has launched lower-priced versions of its product, which has caused the entire brand to
appear more down-market.

That's a problem for Treasury because the market for lowerpriced wines in the U.S. is highly
competitive and is not growing. By comparison, while the market for wines over $15 is still very small,
it has more growth potential.
“It's your classic aspirational wine market," said Barbara Insel, chief executive officer of Stonebridge
Research Group LLC in California, and a global industry consultant. “And yet, the Australians have
approached the U.S. as a cheap and cheerful market...

Maybe [the bidders] saw a depressed [stock] price. You just have to talk to a few people in the industry
in the U.S. to see that there's room for improvement, and the brands are undervalued."

who traditionally drank wine are moving to other beverages.
Meanwhile, wine consumption in North America has grown. Many vintners have also marketed their
brands heavily in China, where aspirational consumers are developing a taste for it. However,
Treasury was among the wine makers affected by a government crackdown on gift-giving last year,
which hit sales.
Treasury Wine Estates is the world's second-largest publiclytraded wine maker, after U.S.based
Constellation Brands Inc. It was spun off from Foster's Group Ltd. – maker of Australia's most famous
lager – in May, 2011. Foster's has since been acquired by SABMiller PLC.
TPG, formerly known as Texas Pacific Group, owned Treasury's largest brand, California-based
Beringer, before it was sold to Foster's in 2000 for $2.9-billion.
Treasury also faces an image problem for its Australian wines. The popularity of competing brand
Yellow Tail, which peaked in the U.S. two years ago, has cast a pall, Ms. Insel said. Many people now
associate Australian wines with sweet shiraz, rather than complex or high-end products.

(Treasury owns more than 80 brands produced in Australia, the U.S., New Zealand and Italy.)

Treasury does not just suffer from greater competition in lowend wines; it also struggles with managing
its supply. Cheaper wines actually do not get better with age, so a company that sells them cannot
ride out a lull in demand by shelving its products; hence last year's big dump.

Since then, observers have been waiting for takeover bids to emerge, Mr. Correia said.

“They do have a sizable portfolio of brands and properties," he said. “A play could be to install some
new management … that could be a fairly long-term, and expensive proposition, to turn this back into
a highly profitable company. It's going to need some really effective, strong management."
