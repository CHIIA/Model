0437 GMT [Dow Jones] Lead December Japan government bond futures fall further after a weak auction
of 20-year JGBs. "It was a very weak result, with yields having fallen as well as ahead of [Prime Minister
Shinzo] Abe's announcement about delaying the sales tax tonight," said Barclays Securities Japan
strategist Akito Fukunaga. The Ministry of Finance sells 1.098 trillion yen of 1.4% 20-year bonds with the
lowest price of 101.55 yielding 1.301%, much lower than street forecasts for a lowest price of 102.05.
The bid-to-cover ratio deteriorates to 2.88 from 3.59 at the last tender, while the tail is longer at 0.41 from
0.08. It was the first time since December, 2009 that the tail has been over 0.40 at a 20-year auction.
Lead December JGB futures are down 0.34 at 145.93. (eleanor.warnock@wsj.com)

0435 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian naphtha producers such as Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand
may divert cargo to Japan from China. This comes as Asia's biggest economy is set to become
self-sufficient in naphtha, a petrochemical product, in around 2017 as coal-to-chemical plants start
operations, says Mizuho Bank in a report. China plans to build several coal-to-chemical plants inland.
Once products from these plants start meeting demand from China's coastal industrial areas, the
country's imports would drop, the report says. Currently, Japan is a naphtha exporter to China. However,
Japanese naphtha producers are the least competitive among the Asian firms currently exporting to
China, according to report. (mari.iwata@wsj.com)

0425 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/USD is "edging a bit higher" as markets await news from Japan, says
Stuart Ive, OM Financial senior client advisor. "We are waiting for an announcement and that's propping
everything up at the moment," he says. Markets expect Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to say he
will put off a planned sales-tax increase. He is also set to call for a general election on Dec. 14 to renew
his mandate for an all-out assault on deflation, which has combined with falling wages and weak demand
to keep Japan's economy sluggish. "The Kiwi is benefiting from the cross-yen trades coming through and
the carry trade may be coming back into play," says Ive. Markets will then focus on the overnight
GlobalDairyTrade auction for any clues on whether milk prices are stabilizing.

0418 GMT [Dow Jones] PVEP, the leading production arm of state-owned PetroVietnam, says it has
discovered oil from a new well offshore southern Vietnam. It says oil is flowing at 1,000 barrels per day
from Than Nong-1X well in Block 05-1A 260 kilometers southeast of Ba Ria Vung Tau province. The well
is also churning out two million cubic feet of gas a day, the company says. It doesn't say when
commercial production from the well will begin, but adds that it will conduct more exploration drilling in
the area. (trong-khanh.vu@wsj.com; Twitter: @TrongKhanhVu)

0408 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's central bank appears resigned to the fact the Australian dollar is set
to remain overvalued, says Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS. The Reserve Bank of Australia
repeated in policy meeting minutes Tuesday that the Australian dollar is fundamentally too high, but it
also expressed its concern that Bank of Japan policy action could boost the Australian dollar. This view,
coupled with Australia's success in gaining a free-trade agreement with China this week could keep the
Australian dollar supported, particularly against the euro and yen, says Gibbs. (james.glynn@wsj.com;

0359 GMT [Dow Jones] Japanese oil refining margins improved after roughly 500,000 barrels a day of
capacity cuts, and additional cuts of some 400,000 b/d expected in the following three years would
sustain a proper supply-demand balance, Mizuho Bank says in a report. Refiners such as JX Holdings
Inc. (5020.TO), Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019.TO) and Cosmo Oil Co. (5007.TO), acting on government
orders, closed some of their crude distillation units before the end of March, in line with Japan's
decreasing oil demand. As a result of the elimination of overcapacity, margins at these refiners nearly
doubled in the first 6 months of this year, the report says. Because the government plans to impose
another round of capacity cuts by March 2017, on expectation of continued oil demand decline,
operating rates at refineries would remain high, the report says. (mari.iwata@wsj.com)

0342 GMT [Dow Jones] First State Investments will not change its position on fixed income assets in
Indonesia following a fuel subsidy cut announced late Monday, says Jamie Grant, head of Asian fixed
income for the firm, but sees the development as positive for the country. First State oversees about $53
billion in fixed income assets, including Indonesian government bonds denominated in rupiah and U.S.
dollars. Grant says the subsidy cut is positive for all asset classes. "It's positive on all fronts, from a
sentiment point of view, from a presidential point of view, from the currency point of view," he says,
adding that the central bank "will take note of the positive move from all asset classes today and that
may give them the luxury of possibly staying on hold" when it meets Tuesday afternoon. The subsidy cut
will save the Indonesian government about $10 billion a year. (jake.watts@wsj.com; Twitter: @jmwatts_)

0340 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's central bank again points to risk in China's property market as a
potential source of instability for Australia. Prashant Newnaha, an economist at TD Securities, said the
commentary contained in the RBA's policy meeting minutes seemed to be a few notches above earlier
references. The RBA said there was "considerable uncertainty" about Chinese property demand and
Mr. Newnaha said it would be tracking closely the level of future concern. Australia is a big exporter of
iron ore to China, much of which is used in steel manufacturing, which finds its way into housing and
infrastructure. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0340 GMT [Dow Jones] Upgrade demand and increased use of financing will be the primary factors
supporting auto sales in China, says Deutsche Bank. "Our survey indicates that buyers from 4 years ago
are now ready for a significant replacement cycle over the next 2 years," it says. "The availability of credit
will provide additional support for the industry." Deutsche upgrades Great wall (2333.HK) to buy and
raises its target 34% to HK$44.7 as it expects the car maker to benefit from upgrade demand and
ramp-up in contributions from new models. Its top pick, however, is Brilliance China (1114.HK) because
of its resilient car sales. Great Wall is up 1.0% to HK$35.9 while Brilliance rises 0.3% to HK$12.2.

0330 GMT [Dow Jones] The lowest accepted price for 20-year JGBs for the 0345 GMT auction result is
likely around 102.05, traders say. The sale is a reopening of the 1.4% coupon No. 150 issue. "Yield

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities strategist Katsutoshi Inadome says. "There won't likely be
aggressive buying of 20-year JGBs." He also says the fact that the auction is taking place during a series
of closely-watched events, including an announcement from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about the sales
tax, could also contribute to a weak auction result. Lead December JGB futures are down 0.17 at 146.10
at the midday close. (eleanor.warnock@wsj.com)

0319 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank Indonesia will hold an extraordinary meeting today in response to a
government increase in the price of subsidized fuel, a bank official says, with economists tipping a slight
rise in the bank's benchmark policy rate. The central bank will issue a statement at 3 p.m. Jakarta time
today, the official says. Given that in BI's last extraordinary meeting, in August 2013, it raised rates
50bps, "there is a good reason that we might see the central bank hiking today," says OCBC economist
Wellian Wiranto. A hike of 25bps to help offset inflation would "help cement BI's revamped reputation as
a more proactive central bank since 2013." Wiranto says the fuel-price increases will likely raise inflation
to around 7.6% year-on-year in December, up from less than 5% currently, while Finance Minister
Bambang Brodjonegoro said Monday night that inflationary pressures would likely last through February
2015. (ben.otto@wsj.com; @benottoWSJ)

0315 GMT [Dow Jones] Gold prices are marginally lower in Asian trade. The yellow metal's price has
weakened as the U.S dollar strengthened following news Monday that Japan's economy shrank for a
second quarter in a row--gold moves in inverse relation with the dollar. At 0305 GMT, the spot gold price
was at $1,187/oz, compared to the opening price of $1,187.20/oz. (biman.mukherji@wsj.com)
