* A three-storey penthouse at propsoed Crown Sydney hotel could be the first Australian property to
break $100 million price bracket
* Company paid same figure for the licence to operate the VIP-only casino

* Crown has not yet lodged a development application for the 69-storey tower proposal at
Barangaroo’s casino resort
* It has not been decided whether to apply for the residence to be privately sold or used as a luxury
villa to entice the international big spenders
A three-storey penthouse at the top of James Packer's proposed Crown Sydney hotel could be the
first Australian property to shatter the $100 million barrier - the same figure forked out for the licence
to operate the VIP-only casino.
The billionaire’s company Crown has not yet lodged a development application for the 69-storey
tower proposal at Barangaroo’s casino resort - and it has not been decided whether to apply for the
residence to be privately sold or used as a luxury villa to etnice the international big spenders.
However, CBRE chairman Justin Brown predicts the apartment might sell for up to nine figures
compared to similar property around the world.
‘The penthouse at One Hyde Park (in London’s Knightsbridge) sold for $255 million (£140 million)
recently,’ Mr Brown told The Sydney Morning Herald.
‘Penthouse apartments are selling in New York and Hong Kong for $100 million’
Mr Brown said the calibre of such a property would ‘seriously position itself globally’.

The proposed resort pushes 270 metres despite the 170-metre height limit previously set to develop a
hotel in the area.
The site’s developer Lend Lease is in discussions with the state government about relocating the
hotel on to Barangaroo South following community outrage about the original plan.

Crown paid a $100 million licence fee to the NSW government this month to run the casino for 99
years from November 2019.
As part of the agreement the company has promised the state government will receive a guaranteed
minimum $1 billion in gambling taxes and fees over the first 15 years of the casino's operation.
