QUEENSLAND Industrial sale, 106 Potassium Street, Narangba, Brisbane A local private investor has
purchased an industrial property in Brisbane’s north for $5.35 million. The warehouse and office
property is leased by packaging material supplier Honicel and fuel company Petro Industrial. Its
annual rental income is $506,278, with the leases to expire in 2016 and 2017. Knight Frank industrial

Retail Group, Bunnings Warehouse, and Costco Wholesale,” Mr Clifford said.
