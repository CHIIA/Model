yields were down 4 points to 4.08%. The $A is at 92.39US c, up about 45 points on last evening.

Our market rose, presumably almost wholly on overseas buying of various leaders and particularly the
banks to avail of our much higher interest rate. There were far more sellers than buyers. The rise in the $A
against the US dollar is an oddity, with our economy weakening while the US economy strengthens - and
is cruelling prices received by all Aussie exporters and the inward bound tourism industry.

"I'll call us down about 21 points, but we may hold better than that".

"Bernborough" said, "Yesterday I was surprised about how much we went up - we've got to give back
some of yesterday's gains today.

"There has to have been buying from offshore. Locals are not buying, but they are not selling either - so
any buying pushes stock prices and the $A up.

"We still offer excellent yields, and seem to have become a safe haven once again.

"I'll call us down about 21 points, but we may hold better than that".

*BKW: Int NPAT down 4.5%, div 13.5c ff, outlook positive

Brickworks Ltd for the half year ended January 31 announced a net profit after tax down 4.5% to $53.427
million on revenue up 4.6% to $325,622 million.

A 13.5c fully franked dividend was announced, record date April 15. There is no DRP available.
Net profit before tax was up 16.2% to $68.2 million vs the previous corresponding period (pcp) with the
prior period adversely impacted by $8 million in significant costs before tax.

Normal eps was down 4.7% to 36.1c vs 37.9c for the pcp.

Basic eps was up 0.3% to 38.1c vs 38c for the pcp.

NTA backing per security is up 3.2% to $10.04 vs $9.73c for the pcp.

Brickworks continues to outperform the All Ordinaries Accumulation Index in terms of total shareholder
return over most time horizons. TSR for the year to January 31 was 15.7%, 5% higher than the index.

Gearing fell to 18.8% at January 31 2014 from 19.7% at July 31 2013. Total interest bearing debt
decreased to 4330 million and Net Debt was $313.9 million at January 31 2014. Net debt to capital
employed decreased to 15.2% for the half.
The chairman Robert Millner said in the report while EBIT was $19.2 million, up 36.7% on the prior
corresponding period and EBITDA was $31.8 million with improved earnings achieved on the back of
restructuring initiatives implemented in prior periods, the EBIT margin of 6.5% remains below acceptable
levels.
Brickworks made an itemised report on its various businesses. Its 42.72% stake in Washington H Soul
Pattinson returned a normalised contribution of $23.6 million for the half year ended January 31 2014,
down 17.8% from $28.7 million for the previous corresponding period due primarily to reduced earnings
from New Hope Corporation. SOL has delivered outstanding returns over the short, medium and long term
outperforming the All Ordinaries Accumulation Index by 2.6% p.a. over 5 years, 4% p.a. over ten years
and 6.6% p.a. over 15 years.

Perpetual/MH Carnegie Proposal

A general meeting to consider Perpetual and Carnegie's proposals is currently scheduled for may 5 2014.
The proposal has caused Brickworks to incur $1.8 million in costs during the six months to January 31. Of
greater concern is the major distraction to management and staff, the full impact of which is difficult to
quantify.

Outlook

The current upturn in housing activity has been relatively slow to translate into increased building
materials demand, with the notable exception of brick sales in WA.

"However we are now experiencing a more broad based recovery in demand with Austral Bricks sales
volumes in March tracking more than 30% ahead of the prior year .. if demand continues to build and
stock holdings fall to unsustainable levels, Brickworks is well placed with the flexibility to bring on kilns
currently mothballed" the company said in the report.

*SIP: NPAT up 186.5%, 2c ff final div, no DRP, $67.5m cash, no debt/positive

up 186.5% to $53.536 million on revenue up 1.1% to $2.973 billion.

NTA backing per security is 50c vs 51c for the previous year.

Page292of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The group had $67.5 million in cash and zero debt at year end

A fully franked final 2c dividend was announced, ex date is April 3, record date is April 9. The DRP will not
apply.

Managing director and CEO Mark Hooper said that targeted investment over the past three years is
beginning to show benefits across the business. The acquisition of Central Healthcare represents a
strategic opportunity for Sigma to open up avenues for growth in the retail pharmacy and hospital network.

He said a flat PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) necessitates a sharper focus on non dispensary
sales. Sigma is actively introducing a number of structured professional service initiatives into the Amcal,
Amcal Max and Guardian pharmacy networks. Also over 100 exclusive and private label products have
been launched in the past 12 months with another 200 in the pipeline, only available through Sigma's
pharmacy network including products such as the Boots Laboratories Serum7 and colour THEORY
ranges.

Outlook

Sigma expects to achieve revenue growth above the dampening effect of onging Government PBS price
disclosure reform in the coming year.

Sigma also has a strong cash position to support ongoing capital management, the ability to pay future
dividends as well as fund investment opportunities.

Analysts expectations: $44.2 mln, div 2.2c.
Analysts comment: A leading broker yesterday said it expects revenue up 2% to $3 billion and EBIT of
70.8 million with a dividend of 4.3c.

The broker said SIP revenue should outpace the market via growth in Chemist Warehouse.

The broker said it still believes Chemists Warehouse has excessive terms, and faster growth will limit the
rate of working capital reduction.

Reduction in profits from atorvastatin among SIP's customers may further hinder reduction in working
capital, the broker added. Its price target is 62c.

*SIP: To acquire Central Healthcare for $24.5 mln +
Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd yesterday announced an agreement to purchase all of the issued capital of
Central Healthcare Pty Ltd for $24.5 million with the potential for a further earn out payment at June 30
2015.

Central Healthcare is a wholesaler and distributor of pharmaceutical products to hospitals and retail
pharmacies and is an approved CSO distributor in Victoria, NSW, ACT and Queensland. It also owns and
manages the Pharmasave retail brand.

Central Healthcare and Sigma will continue to operate as stand alone businesses. The current Central
Healthcare and Pharmasave management teams will continue to drive the businesses. (Mar 16)

Record date is April 17.
*Regular Profit after tax was $63.5 million, a decrease of 21.1% compared to $80.5 million. This was

deferred tax expenses incurred on movements in the carrying value of equity accounted associates.

*IGO: SAG mill down 17 days/will meet Cu, Ag prod guidance, not Zn
Independence group NL advised a planned maintenance event during March 2014 established that the

During this period of downtime a planned 4 day shutdown was brought forward form April for maintenance
activities. The concentrator has now been successfully restarted. In total 17 days of concentrator
production has been lost, mining has continued without interruption.
The company remains confident it will meet production guidance on copper and silver for 2014, however
zinc metal is expected to be approximately 10% below the lower end of 2014 production guidance. In part
this is due to the downtime of the SAG mill, but also due to zinc grades being lower than planned on

*PAB: Positive Phase I/II results for PAT-SM6 for multiple myeloma patients

Patry's Ltd announced the final results from its Phase I/Iia open label study in patients with refractory or
relapsed multiple myeloma conducted in 12 patients, media range 71 years, with refractory or relapsed
multiple myeloma. On average each patient received five prior lines of therapy including proteasome
inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs or stem cell transplantation. Twelve patients, 3 in each cohort
received 4 intravenous infusions of PAT-SM6 at 0.3mg/kg, 1mg/kg,3mg/kg or 6mg/kg per dose. All
patients were then assessed for a response at36 days post final treatment. At all dose levels PAT-SM6
was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities being reported.

Patients who had received prior treatment with proteasome inhibitors responded much better to PAT-SM6
treatment than patients who had been previously treated with IMIDs or other chemotherapeutics. This
indicates that PAT-SM6 may act synergistically with proteasome inhibitors such as Carfilzomib to induce
better clinical responses. This will be tested in Patrys' next clinical trial in which PAT-SM6 is combined
with Amgen's Carfilzomib.
