PROMISING IRON ORE PROJECT NEAR BROKEN HILL

Sydney - Friday - March 28: (RWE Australian Business News) - CARPENTARIA EXPLORATION
(ASX:CAP) has reported a maiden Indicated Resource and a 20pc increase in contained
premium-quality magnetite concentrate for its flagship Hawsons Iron Project near Broken Hill, NSW.

The project is held by a joint venture between Carpentaria (60pc interest) and private resources investor
Pure Metals Pty Ltd (40pc).
The maiden Indicated Resource comprises 215 million tonnes containing 35 million tonnes of
premium-quality magnetite concentrate.
Total Inferred plus Indicated Resource estimate has been expanded to 1.77 billion tonnes at a
magnetite mass recovery grade of 14.9pc, a 26pc tonnage increase on the company's December 2010
estimate.
Total contained iron concentrate has risen 20pc to 263 million tonnes, compared with the previous
estimate of 220Mt, while maintaining a premium grade of 69.7pc Fe and just 2.9pc Si02.

Carpentaria's managing director, Quentin Hill, said the resource upgrade was a milestone in the
project's development, resulting from diligent geological work by the company and independent
resource estimator H&S Consultants Pty Ltd.
Hawsons Iron Project has a new ore type and opportunity.
It has potential to deliver high-quality iron ore concentrate or pellets at 10.20Mtpa for 50 to 100 years.
* Reliable and secure supply delivered to a port in China for $A60.65.

* Transport infrastructure is in place, including a rail line and port, with only a small upgrade to Port Pirie
for 10.30Mtpa export capacity.

* Potential to increase export capacity using a pipeline on existing rail route.
* Project approvals on track for Mining Lease by 2014 and production by 2016.

* Project supported by JORC Resource and audited pre-feasibility study with excellent financial returns

* Carpentaria has 60pc ownership.

Carpentaria incurred a net loss of $3.22m in the half-year ended December 31, compared with a
$859,584 loss for the same period in 2012.
During the latest period, simplification of the processing flow sheet for the Hawsons Iron Project was
completed with the potential to significantly reduce the capital cost.
The company is awaiting an independent report commissioned to look at a reduced capital cost model
utilising existing infrastructure.

for a conceptual 5 to 10 Mtpa startup operation.

The newly labelled Braemar South Project, comprising the contiguous Braemar JV (EL 5181) and 100pc
South Dam (EL 4395) licences, is at the southern end of the highly prospective magnetite-bearing
Braemar Iron Formation, 200km northeast of Adelaide.

During the period, independent geologist H&S Consultants Pty Ltd estimated an Exploration Target in
the range of 1.7bn to 3.1bn tonnes, with an estimated magnetite mass recovery (DTR) of 12pc to 27pc
for between 200Mt and 850Mt of iron concentrate at 63-67pc iron for the Braemar South Project.
The company expanded its strategic gold portfolio in the Lachlan Fold Belt with the grant during the
half-year of the highly prospective Grong Grong licence as EL 8189 (formerly ELA 4867) near
Narrandera, NSW.

Also, a number of significant results were returned from the Advene (EL 8095) licence.

At Advene, located 320km northwest of Canberra in central southwestern NSW, Carpentaria
commenced geochemical sampling.

In total, seven separate phases of sampling were completed at Advene, with each phase increasing the
footprint and tenor of gold anomalism at the Josephine Moulder (JM) prospect.

The results from Advene are considered very encouraging.

SHARE PRICE MOVEMENTS

---------------------

Shares of Carpentaria Exploration rose 1.5c to 12c yesterday. Rolling high for the year is 30.5c and low
9.9c. The company has 123.8 million shares on issue with a market cap of $14.8 million.

At Barellan (EL 7896), planning for an auger weathered bedrock sampling geochemical survey program
to investigate the extents and tenor of the known gold anomaly was undertaken during the half-year.

The Tooloom EL8082 was granted in the June quarter as EL 8082.

It is located in the New England Fold Belt (NEFB) 50km northeast of Tenterfield.
The licence covers 130 mineral occurrences, of which almost 100 are gold.

The NEFB regionally contains mineralisation associated with Permo-Triassic age intrusions.

Positive results have been received from a detailed study using a smaller startup case that matches
existing infrastructure at the Hawsons magnetite iron project.

BACKGROUND

----------
Carpentaria Exploration Ltd is an exploration company with a difference.

Based in Brisbane, its name stems from the exploration arm of MIM Holdings, which Carpentaria
chairman Nick Sheard previously led to global success.
The company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on November 14 2007 with a focus on
discovering and developing bulk commodities, base and precious metals in eastern Australia.
With two discoveries in the first three years, including the $3.2bn Hawsons Iron Project, Carpentaria
has been named by Allan Trench among Resourcestocks magazine's "Top 100 Resource Stocks" to
watch.
Carpentaria has an attractive pipeline of projects across eastern Australia, including iron ore, tin,
tungsten, copper, gold and nickel, in a region hosting world-class ore bodies.
The company aims to grow shareholder value through discovery, development and acquisition as well
as divestment.

Carpentaria uses its own in-house project generation methods to discover mineralised systems, adding
value through exploration and strategic joint ventures.

discovery as well as funding a major pre-feasibility study at Hawsons.
The company has a proven technical team with the board encompassing a collective 140 years of
resource industry experience, positioning Carpentaria for growth into a mid-tier mining house.

Carpentaria says its motto describes its passion for exploration: "We find it. We prove it. We make it
possible."
