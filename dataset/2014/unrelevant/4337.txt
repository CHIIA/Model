A CHINESE investor has struck a $4 million-plus deal to secure a retail/office complex along
Coolangatta’s main street at the southern end of the Gold Coast.

It is understood the new owner was among several investors that had been circling the fully-tenanted
Griffith Plaza, which was in the hands of receivers.

The complex (pictured) occupies a 1386sq m island site at 152-154 Griffith St and its eight
tenancies return a combined net rental income of $416,203 a year with CPI-indexed growth.
Industry sources said the property, at the junction of Dixon St and one block from Greenmount
beach, was sold on a yield of “circa 9 per cent”.
Its tenancy mix includes restaurants, beauty services, surf equipment and apparel, and a property
services firm. The average remaining leasing term is more than four years.

Lachlan Harris and Kevin Ramsey of CBRE were the marketing agents. Griffith Plaza was developed
in 2000 on a former service station site. It has a net lettable area of 824sq m and a 250sq m licensed
alfresco area with the potential to strata title and sell down.In addition to its seven retail businesses
and office tenancy, it has basement parking.
