Second round bids for JPMorgan 's Global Special Opportunities Group, an Asia-based principal
investment business worth as much as $1 billion, are due on Monday.

Bain Capital 's debt arm, Sankaty Advisers, is running hard at the deal which would provide the
successful acquirer with a significant platform into the Asia-Pacific. More than half of the loans are in
the region.

The Hong Kong-based Global Special Opportunities Group, which manages assets worth about
$US2.1 billion ($2.3 billion), includes loans out to Metro GlassTech, Griffin's Foods and
MediaWorks, all based in New Zealand.

In Australia, it has investments in Peters Ice Cream, Accolade Wines, DFO South Wharf and
Townsville-based Domain Central, Queensland's largest bulky goods and outlet shopping centre.

The unit also includes mezzanine loans to US and European companies.
New York-based hedge fund Davidson Kempner and global private equity giant KKR have been cited
as potential buyers although some argue the latter has dropped out.

Bain's Sankaty may have the competitive edge, given it snapped up the Lloyds' Murray portfolio in
Australia last year.

The unit has been seeking to expand in Australia and in 2012 drafted in Mitchell Stack, the Future
Fund's former head of fixed debt and alternatives, to spearhead its growth.
Prior to the Murray portfolio purchase, Sankaty, which has close to $16 billion under management
and recently hired Archer Capital investment associate Chris Coates, had been involved in several
Australian distressed debt situations, most notably the $2 billion-plus debt for equity swap of
Australia's largest energy infrastructure company, Alinta.
