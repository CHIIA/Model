TNG Ltd. has signed a binding agreement with Chinese supplier Sinometal (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. for the
sale of magnetite concentrate produced from its wholly owned Mount Peake vanadium-titanium-iron
project in the Northern Territory, Australia.
The agreement entails the off-take of 500,000 tonnes per annum to 1 million tpa of magnetite
concentrate that TNG plans to produce during the first phase of operations at Mount Peake, according to
a Nov. 17 news release.

The agreement also encompasses the marketing and sale of magnetite concentrate from the project to
Chinese customers like Chengde Iron and Steel Group as well as a maximum preproduction financing of
A$5 million for subsequent shipments.

Proceeds from the early magnetite concentrate sales will generate TNG an early revenue stream for the
planned two-phase development of Mount Peake. A definitive feasibility study on the project is currently
underway.
"While there has been a short-term slowdown in the steel market in China, the fundamentals of the steel
industry overall in that country remain extremely strong and the long-term demand outlook remains firm,"
TNG Managing Director Paul Burton said.
The company earlier signed similar agreements with global commodity trader Gunvor Group,
Korea-based ferrovanadium producer Woojin Ind. Co. Ltd. and Australian chemical products distributor
Global Pacific Partners for its iron, vanadium and titanium products, respectively.
