A Fawkner property syndicate has acquired twin service centres in Victoria for $23.2 million. The
service centres in Longwarry will be for the sixth syndicate in Fawkner's portfolio, and take the number
of centres held to four. The sites are situated on the periphery of the major growth corridor to the
south-east of Melbourne. Traffic flow is estimated to be in excess of 12,000 vehicles per day on each
carriageway of the Princes Freeway, including about 2000 commercial vehicles. Caltex occupies the
sites on a double net lease until late 2020, with further options totalling 30 years. The sites were
purchased from the Spargo Group, associated with Melbourne football Club identity Peter Spargo.
Fawkner negotiated the deal directly with the vendor.
