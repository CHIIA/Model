NEW 6 YEAR RECORD HIGH AS MACRO FEARS EASE, CHINA ECO RISE

"Reasonable chance of a healthy bull market correction on the S&P500 sometime in the next few
months.. This might just provide a trading opportunity" - Morgans respected strategist Michael Knox in a
report today.

Michael Knox examined the charting pattern on the S&P500, concluding it has only a 33.6% chance of
going higher ."This is a polite way of saying that it has a 66.4% chance of going down" Michael added.
While at 8% over valued the over valuation is not dire, "It has a two out of three chance of going down"
he concluded.

Our market closed up 33.4 points to 5576.7, down from its early high of 5598.2 but shrugging off fears of
a higher interest rate following the CPI number. The market rose 8 points on matchout. Volume was
average at $4 billion.
The HSBC/Markit flash China manufacturing PMI also encouraged.

projects.
