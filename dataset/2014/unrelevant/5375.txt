APA Group's shareholders were bracing for the year's second-largest equity raising on Tuesday
night, in an effort to fund a $5.5 billion acquisition in Queensland.
Sources said APA would work late into the night so it would be able to unveil a $1.7 billion to
$2 billion equity raising on Wednesday morning.

The raising was to be done as a renounceable rights issue to existing investors and underwritten by
Deutsche Bank, Macquarie Capital and Morgan Stanley.

APA was preparing the funding package after being selected as the preferred bidder for BG Group's
Queensland gas pipeline, as revealed by The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday afternoon.
It's understood APA made a winning bid at close to $5.5 billion, which was enough to see off rivals
including IFM Investors, QIC Limited, AMP Capital and China Investment Corporation. A deal is
expected to be announced before the ASX opens on Wednesday.

APA and its rivals lobbed bids on November 28, before meeting with BG in Sydney on Monday.

It is understood a handful of BG executives made the trip from London for the final discussions.

BG will continue to own the gas project and wanted to meet the potential owners of the pipeline, which
carries gas 540 kilometres from the fields to the processing plant in Gladstone. APA is expected to tell
shareholders that the deal will be accretive and defend the larger than expected price tag.
APA chairman Len Bleasel told the Financial Review in November that his company was counting on
debt and equity markets to support their bid for the BG pipeline.
APA also had $800 million of cash and undrawn debt funding as of June 30, which was bolstered by
$780 million from the recent sale of its 33 per cent in gas distributor Envestra.

The BG auction's closing price is set to confirm a red-hot market for infrastructure assets, with listed
players able to compete with unlisted funds because of their low cost of equity. Goldman Sachs ran
the auction, while the final price ended well above initial expectations thanks to the tariff arrangements
and competitive bidding.

It will be interesting to see whether the auction sparks selling intentions in the other two LNG ventures
under construction in Queensland.
Santos's GLNG venture and Origin Energy's Australia Pacific LNG venture would have been watching
the sale closely, as they decide whether to sell their projects' pipelines.
