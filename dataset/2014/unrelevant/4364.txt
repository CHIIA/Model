"Floor will be 5125. Ceiling will be 5241.. close at 5169, down 21 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract down 23 points. The weight of evidence suggests that our market should
challenge its 28-October-2013 high of 5457 points going forward.

"The same evidence warns us however that it may be the last act in an intermediate term topping process.
"The retailers are the canary in the coal mine - they took out their December low on the recent downturn
and look set to challenge their June-2012 low in due course.

"The Tech sector, another growth sector, came close to breaking its December low. "And the banks are
struggling too.

"Unless these sectors gain upside traction, the writing is on the wall for a larger decline going forward.

"But none of this matters for today. I am hedging my bets with the high and low today. The floor will be
5125. The ceiling will be 5241. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at 5169, down 21
points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 1.9 points to 5190 last Friday.

*EBA to test banks' ability to respond to sovereign debt crisis

The largest banks in Europe will face a stress test and will need to show that their capital won't dip below
5.5% of their assets in an economic crisis, the European Banking Authority (EBA) said last night.

The exercise will examine a sample of 124 banks that cover more than half of each EU member state's
banking industry. The test is scheduled to begin around the end of May, results will be published at end
October.
The tests will be the first in Europe after the EBA told banks in December 2011 to raise Euro 114.7 billion
in fresh capital to respond to the area's sovereign debt crisis.

Page47of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The lenders will be tested on resilience to credit, market and sovereign risk, securitization and cost of
funding. Both trading and banking book assets will be tested.

According to the EBA's guidelines, the ECB may decide to set stricter requirements for the stress test and
include more lenders than those included by the EBA.

The ECB will take over supervision duties from domestic regulators in the Euro area in November this
year.
