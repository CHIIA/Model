AUSTRALIA'S farm sector needs two key ingredients in order to thrive during the next 20 years new
investment backing for family farms, and milk.

The Murray Goulburn cooperative estimates every Australian would be, on average, more than $800
better off today if the nation's dairyfarmers had not quit the industry in droves during the past decade.

Instead of maintaining a respected 15 per cent share of global dairy export markets, Australian milk
production has been slipping 1.7pc annually despite a big surge in world dairy product demand in the
past five years.

We now supply just 7pc of the international trade.

Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand has been doing the opposite, converting beef and sheep
country into dairy farms and growing its annual production by about 3.5pc.
NZ's share of the global milk product trade is now 37pc up from a stake similar to Australia in 2002.
Growth in demand for dairy foods is forecast to be more than double that of the next two
fastest-growing food categories combined by 2020, dragged along largely by demand from China.
Chinese imports of dairy foods were worth just $309 million in 2001, but by last year had soared to
$US6.2 billion.
"Dairy is truly an amazing story of growth. It really is so huge," MG shareholder relations general
manager Robert Poole said.

"Unfortunately we have not been in a position to take advantage of it, but NZ saw the chance and
grabbed it."
A difficult decade of drought, milk market deregulation, a rising $A and low farmgate milk returns
eroding farmer confidence levels had convinced many producers it was time to stop milking, sell their
farms, sell irrigation water rights, or semi-retire.

"None of this make sense for an Australian industry with such a great outlook," Mr Poole said.
"We need to reverse the trend and get farmland back into dairy production.
"Getting people to invest in dairy again is going to deliver an incredible prize."

He said a 3.5pc compound increase in annual production would deliver an extra $5b a year to the
national economy from export earnings by 2020.

To reclaim 15pc of the global trade by 2030 would bring in $11b - equivalent to an extra $824 per
capita every year.

Australia's biggest food business was determined to do its bit to encourage as much production
growth as possible.

A key plank in Murray Goulburn's strategy was to promote growth by providing farmgate pricing
confidence to its expanding supplier network in NSW, Vic, Tas and SA.
This trading year MG suppliers would be paid 50 cents a litre a near record and the company's
objective was to increase its milk price by a further 7c/L (equivalent to $1kg for milk solids) to
encourage a turnaround in supply volumes.
