Fonterra plans to enter a joint venture with China’s Beingmate that will own the dairy giant’s Darnum
plant in Australia and produce infant formula products for the Chinese market — for an investment of
$615 million.

The Australian joint venture will be 51 per cent owned by Beingmate and 49 per cent by Fonterra and will
distribute Fonterra’s Anmum brand products into China, the Auckland-based company said.

The two companies will also evaluate joint investments in dairy farms in China.
Fonterra will shortly start a process to issue a partial tender offer to gain up to a 20 per cent stake in
Beingmate. It didn’t specify if this was a stake in Beingmate Baby & Food Co, a listed Chinese
company with a market value of US$2.39 billion ($2.85 billion). The infant formula partnership would
mark the first significant tie up in that market since the disastrous San Lu venture that failed amid a
tainted milk scandal in 2008.

“Our partnership with Beingmate will show the benefits of an integrated and secure supply chain, starting
in New Zealand — our number one milk pool — where we are fast-tracking investment in milk
processing capacity to meet global demand,” CEO Theo Spierings said.
In a separate statement, Fonterra said it will invest $555 million to build a 4.4 million litres a day drier at
Lichfield in South Waikato while adding three new plants at its Edendale site in Southland that will
produce milk protein concentrate, a reverse osmosis plant that will increase capacity on an extra drier by
300,000 litres a day and an anhydrous milk fat plant with a 550,000 a day capacity. BusinessDesk
