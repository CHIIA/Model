ROC By Kim Christian
PERTH, April 29 AAP - Oil and gas players Roc Oil and Horizon Oil have struck an $800 million deal
to merge their Asian assets and produce up to 20,000 barrels of oil per day.

The merged company is expected to have assets across China, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand with a market value of around $800 million.
Roc Oil chief executive Alan Linn said the deal would allow Roc to operate in attractive regions such as
PNG and Malaysia following the departure of larger companies which were focusing on US shale
assets.

"There are things which need to happen in the future in terms of finalising developments and confirming
commerciality on various projects but you have a business that has the potential to be delivering
somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil a day or equivalent through until about 2030," Mr
Linn told analysts on Tuesday.

He said the aim was to create a regional operator "with scale" as gaps in the market emerged.
Under the plan investors will trade their Horizon shares for shares in Roc Oil.
Horizon shareholders will own about 58 per cent of the merged company, and Roc Oil shareholders the
remaining 42 per cent.

Some analysts say the deal appears to be in skewed in favour of Horizon as Roc enters in a net cash
position.

But Roc chairman Mike Harding dismissed the commentary, saying the combined assets offered a good
spread for the short, medium and long term.

"If we were on our own we would continually have to look for the next asset - we can't invest heavily in
exploration," Mr Harding said.
The deal is expected to result in the merged company holding around $200 million in cash.

Horizon chief executive Brent Emmett said the combination of complementary assets and activities
made strategic sense.

"Horizon has been focused on building a leading portfolio of Asian focused assets and the opportunity to
merge with Roc represents a significant step towards achieving that objective," he said.

Mr Emmett is expected to be appointed chief executive while Mr Harding will chair the merged
company.

The boards of both companies support the merger, and Horizon shareholders will meet in July to vote
on the proposal.
If approved, Horizon shareholders will receive 0.724 Roc Oil shares for every Horizon share.
