Chinese shares hit a seven-month high Monday on fresh signs of a recovering economy and
expectations that Beijing will accelerate overhauls in the country's banking sector.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.4% to 2177.95, its fifth consecutive gain and its
highest close since Dec. 13. The index has recorded gains of 2.9% so far this year, compared with a
loss of 6.7% for all of last year.

"The market kept up with last week's momentum, and the rally is mainly driven by further stabilizing
economic conditions," said Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at Soochow Securities.
Official data released Sunday showed that profits at China's largest industrial firms rose 17.9% in
June from a year earlier, up sharply from an 8.9% rise in May.

Banking stocks led the broader market's rally, triggered by market chatter that Beijing may soon allow
some of the nation's biggest lenders, such as Bank of Communications, to bring in more private or
foreign strategic investors. Bank of Communications surged 9.9%.
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China added 2.3% after the country's largest lender by market value
announced that it plans to raise as much as $12.9 billion through the sale of preferred shares.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index added 0.9% to 24428.63, its highest close in more than 3 1/2
years and its fifth consecutive session of gains.

Elsewhere, South Korea's Kospi added 0.7% to 2048.81 as the market extended gains after last
week's government announcement of a stimulus package.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.1% to 5577.40, and India's Sensex fell 0.5% to finish at
25991.23.

With few broad catalysts for the region, investors were looking to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls data,
which will give an update on the health of the world's largest economy. Throughout this week,
investors will also get corporate earnings from Japan and Australia.
In Australia, Leighton Holdings fell 2.4% even after the company beat first-half earnings estimates,
with a net profit of 291.3 million Australian dollars ($274 million), down 20% from a year earlier. The
firm's stock had a strong run-up ahead of the earnings and remains up 12% so far this month.

Healthscope rose 5.2% from its initial-public-offering price in its Australian trading debut.
In Hong Kong, shares of solar-panel parts supplier GCL-Poly Energy rose 1.2% after it said it
expects to post its second consecutive half in the black.
