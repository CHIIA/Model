SGX Mainboard-listed integrated

property developer OUE Limited ("OUE" or the

"Group") today announced a net profit of S$1.0 billion for the three months ended 31 March 2014 ("Q1
2014"), reflecting more than 100% increase from S$2.0 million for the same quarter in the previous
financial period ("Q1 2013").
This increase is largely due to a recognition of net fair value gain on Lippo Plaza property which
amounted to S$114.8 million, as well as the gain amounting to S$986.4 million, resulting from unlocking
the values of Mandarin Orchard Singapore and Mandarin Gallery, which had been disposed to OUE
Hospitality Trust ("OUE H-TRUST"). OUE H-TRUST was deconsolidated as a result of a reduction in the
Group's effective interest subsequent to a distribution in specie made to shareholders in Q1 2014. OUE
H-TRUST is an associate of the Group as at 31 March 2014. The above gains are offset by an
allowance for foreseeable loss of S$105.0 million provided on Twin Peaks based on the latest valuation
obtained.

On the operations front, Q1 2014 also saw a 1.5% year-on-year increase in total revenue to S$106.9
million from S$105.4 million in Q1 2013. Consequently, gross profit increased from S$55.2 million to
S$60.4 million for the same reporting period. These were the results of contributions from Lippo Plaza
property and U.S. Bank Tower.

decline in finance expenses to S$24.4 million. Combined with the one-off gains, the Group recorded a
net profit of S$1.0 billion in Q1 2014, compared to S$2.0 million on the corresponding quarter.

Based on net attributable profit on a fully diluted basis, earnings per share for Q1 2014 and Q1 2013
were 103.93 cents and 0.19 cents respectively. Net asset value per ordinary share remained healthy at
S$4.06 for Q1 2014.

Business Review
During the quarter in review, the Group's Hospitality division registered revenue of S$52.3 million.
Excluding the contribution from the two disposed China Hotels, hospitality revenue increased 4.9%
year-on-year.
Revenue generated from the Group's Property Investment Division increased by S$16.9 million due to
the inclusion of revenue from the Lippo Plaza property, which was acquired by OUE Commercial Real
Estate Investment Trust ("OUE C-REIT") in January 2014. The increase in revenue also came from
contribution at the U.S. Bank Tower and higher occupancy achieved by the remaining commercial
properties of the Group in Q1 2014.
Similarly, the sale of residential units for Twin Peaks contributed to the property development income,
bringing in revenue of S$9.4 million for Q1 2014.

Looking Ahead

Dr. Stephen Riady, OUE's Executive Chairman said, "We are pleased with our results this quarter as we
are now realising the returns from our portfolio of properties. With the refurbishment work in the retail
mall at One Raffles Place near completion and asset enhancement works at OUE Downtown being on
track, we are well positioned to benefit from further strengthening of our recurrent income streams."

"Together with our healthy cash balance of S$864.6 million, we are well-placed to seize opportunities
that will be value-enhancing for OUE's continuous growth," added Dr. Riady.
