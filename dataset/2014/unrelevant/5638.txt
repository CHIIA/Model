Baosteel Group Corporation, China has embarked on takeover of Aquila Resources Limited, a mining
company in Australia.
Specifically, the Company's subsidiary, Baosteel Resources International Co., Ltd. aims to acquire whole
shares of Aquila Resources jointly with Aurizon Holdings Limited, the biggest cargo transportation railway
company in Australia by way of a takeover bid. The purchase price of shares of Aquila Resources is
A$3.40 per share, and the takeover amount based on a 100% shareholding is about A$1.42 billion.

As reported earlier, on 19 December 2013, Baosteel Group purchased additional 4.6% of shares of Aquila
Resources, and raised its shareholding ratio to 19.79% from 15.20%. So, in order to acquire whole shares
of Aquila Resources, the Company will have to acquire remaining 80.21% of shares. In this regard, it will
need about A$1.136 billion to acquire 80.21% of shares.

When Baosteel Group and Aurizon Holdings acquire a 100% shareholding in Aquila Resources, this will
be 85% owned by Baosteel Group and 15% by Aurizon Holdings respectively.
Furthermore, in case of acquisition of 50 - 90% of shares of Aquila Resources, the shares acquired will
be 90% owned by Baosteel Group and 10% by Aurizon Holdings respectively.
Aquila Resources is a middle-ranking mining company in Australia, and as far as the coal-related
business is concerned, the Company is proceeding with Eagle Downs hard coking coal project,
Washpool hard coking coal project and Walton PCI coal project in the State of QLD.

Such being the case, by taking over Aquila Resources, Baosteel Group will be able to take possession of
several excellent coking coal projects including Eagle Downs hard coking coal project and Washpool
hard coking coal project. In that case, Baosteel Group will be able to import hard coking coals produced
from both projects on a long-term and stable basis.
For a reference, among Chinese firms, in February 2014, Kingho Energy Group took over Carabella
Resources Limited, a mining company in Australia through its subsidiary company.
