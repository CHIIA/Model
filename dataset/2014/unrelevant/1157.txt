Koh Wee Meng, chairman of Fragrance Group, bought 6.5 million shares in property developer Tuan
Sing Holdings on the open market at 43.2 cents each on Sept 25. This boosts his stake in Tuan Sing
from 4.46% to 5.02%, making him a significant shareholder of the company.

Tuan Sing’s share price soared to a 52-week high on Sept 29, hitting 47.5 cents, before closing at 45.5
cents. It closed at 44.5 cents on Oct 1. The closing price represents a “still significant” 30.1% discount to
Tuan Sing’s book value, says OCBC analyst Eli Lee. The discount is broadly in line with peers trading at
an average discount of 27.7%. It remains to be seen what Koh intends to do with Tuan Sing, adds Lee.

In 1H2014 ended June. Tuan Sing posted an 11% fall in earnings to $19.5 million from a year ago. This
came on the back of a 22% fall in revenue to $142.9 million. Net asset value rose 2% to 65 cents.
On top of its core businesses of developing residential and commercial projects, Tuan Sing owns the
Grand Hyatt Melbourne and the Hyatt Regency Perth in Australia, grouped under its subsidiary Grand
Hotel Group. In September, it announced the acquisition of the remaining 50% in GHG for A$12.6
million ($14 million). GHG posted earnings of $2.1 million for the six months, up 70% from $1.2 million a
year ago. Both hotels provide 913 rooms in total and have retail and office space totalling 259,100 sq ft.
In 2013, they achieved an occupancy rate of 85%.
In Singapore, Tuan Sing’s main projects include Cluny Park Residence, a 52-unit luxury residential
development on Cluny Park Road, Senett Residence, a 335-unit condominium beside the Pasir Ris MRT
Station, as well as Mont Timah, a landed housing development right next to the Bukit Timah Nature
Reserve. It is also redeveloping Robinson Towers, a 13-storey commercial project in the CBD, which
should be completed in 2016.
It has other investments unrelated to real estate, including an 80.2% stake in SP Corp, a commodities
trading and tyres distribution firm, as well as a 97.9% stake in Hypak Sdn Bhd, which makes packaging
bags in Malaysia. Tuan Sing also holds a 44.5% stake in Gul Technologies, a print circuit board
manufacturer, and a 49% stake in Pan-West Ltd, a golf product retailer.

Meanwhile, Dr Jong Hee Sen, chairman and president of International Healthway Corp (IHC), scooped
up 12 million shares on the open market at 26.5 cents each on Sept 24. This boosts his stake to 11.53%,
which includes deemed stakes held through his shareholdings in Xanery Ltd, his investment vehicle, as
well as various nominee accounts.
IHC develops medical assets in Asia Pacific. Its portfolio includes a medical suite and apartment
complex in Kuala Lumpur, a medical city in Chengdu and a hospital in Wuxi, both of which are in China.
It also owns several nursing facilities in Hokkaido, Okinawa and Nagano, Japan, as well as a private
medical centre in Melbourne.

In 2Q2014 ended June, IHC reported a 91% fall in earnings to $2.63 million from a year ago, despite
revenues rising 14.7% to $9 million. IHC shares closed at 26.5 cents on Oct 1.
