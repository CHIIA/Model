Highlights How the Internet of Things Can Help Future Cities Meet Energy, Economic, Health & Safety,
and Transportation Goals

MELBOURNE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 18, 2014--

TD

Today at the Australian Smart Lighting Summit, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. (NYSE:SSNI) showcased its
vision for the future of smart city and smart energy infrastructure in Australia. In his presentation, "Street
Lighting Controls: Why They're Ready Today, Important for Tomorrow and Critical in Australia," Mr. CJ
Boguszewski, Global Commercial Lead for Smart City Applications for Silver Spring, highlighted the
opportunities for Australian councils to leverage Internet of Things (IoT) technology to help modernize
critical infrastructure such as intelligent and adaptive street lighting.
"By establishing an open, standards-based IP network underpinning multiple applications, from energy to
public lighting to traffic light systems to disaster sensors, cities can leverage network economics to
cost-effectively deploy new smart infrastructure services to their citizenry over time," said Boguszewski.
"With our smart energy networks deployed in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, the market
has made strides in proving out the critical role technology plays in helping modernize its energy and
municipal infrastructure. The next step is advancing to more sophisticated IoT applications, and intelligent
street lights are often the onramp to smarter cities."

Cities today in Australia are faced with costly, ageing infrastructure. Street lights, for example, can
consume as much as 40 percent of a city's energy budget. Smart public lighting networks can help drive
reductions of more than 10 percent in street light energy consumption and can help lower maintenance
costs by up to 30 percent. When combined with LEDs, Silver Spring's Smart City Solution can help deliver
up to 60 percent in energy savings over traditional high-pressure sodium street lights and can help reduce
maintenance costs by up to 35 percent.

Silver Spring's Smart City Solution is comprised of its proven IPv6 wireless networking platform and
management and control software optimized for smart city devices. In addition to smart street lighting,
cities can leverage the open network platform for the deployment of additional smart city services over
time, greatly lowering long-term costs and accelerating speed of deployment for these new services for
their citizens.
Silver Spring's networking platform has connected over 2 million homes and businesses in Australia to
energy providers such as Citipower & PowerCor, Jemena, United Energy and Western Power, helping
improve energy efficiency and to empower consumers to make smarter energy decisions. In New
Zealand, Silver Spring has been selected by SmartCo, a consortium of electricity lines companies, to
deploy an advanced smart grid network across New Zealand, and has already begun deployments with
member company WEL Networks. In Asia, the Singapore Power Group is leveraging a countrywide IPv6
smart infrastructure networking platform from Silver Spring to allow eligible customers in Singapore to now
choose from a variety of retail energy providers and purchase electricity at wholesale market prices.

The Silver Spring Smart City Solution has been selected for programs in global cities including
Copenhagen, Dublin, Glasgow, Miami, Oslo, Paris, and Dongguan in China to help with the economic,
environmental, health and safety, and traffic and transportation challenges they face today.
