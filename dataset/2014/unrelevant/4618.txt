1958 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 may trade nervously as it nears the 6-year peak at
5644.2 after Fed minutes indicated officials debated whether to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
U.S. shares shrugged off the minutes, with the S&P 500 rising 0.4%, but U.S. 10 year bond yields rose 3
basis points to 2.43%. Downside may be limited as the market awaits Fed chief Janet Yellen's Jackson
Hole speech on Friday, but the Fed minutes may inject enough caution about an earlier-than-expected
tightening to cap equities in coming days. Focus remains on domestic earnings reports, with four major
brokers downgrading Wesfarmers (WES.AU) today. BHP (BHP.AU) may be another source of
nervousness after it fell 3.8% on Wednesday. Focus turns to HSBC's China manufacturing data at 0145
GMT. Index last 5634.6. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2357 GMT [Dow Jones]--New Zealand's annual net migration has now crossed the 40,000 threshold, and
"the major factor driving this migration cycle has been movements by both New Zealanders and
Australians across the Tasman as the Australian job market has cooled," says Westpac Bank senior
economist Felix Delbruck. He expects net immigration to peak around 50,000 early next year and says it
will likely support a revival in the housing market over the next year or so. "However any resurgence in
the housing market is likely to be temporary" as by next year job prospects in Australia will likely improve
and the Reserve Bank is also likely to resume hiking interest rates next year. "As mortgage rates
continue to rise, we wouldn't be surprised to see house prices actually fall in the second half of the
decade," he adds. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)

1957 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan cuts Coca Cola Amatil (CCL.AU) target to A$9.75/share from
A$10.10. Says 1H headline numbers were in line with broker's forecasts but the near term earnings
outlook remains uncertain, with no specific full-year guidance provided. Indonesian volumes grew
strongly but pricing was weak. "We are concerned that in an attempt to improve its relationship with The
Coca Cola Company, CCL is sacrificing sustainable margin and pursuing a volume based strategy in
Indonesia." Keeps Neutral rating. "Despite the stock price in our view presenting reasonable value on a
long-term basis, uncertainty around near-term earnings and the potential for a multiple de-rating make it
difficult for us to have an Overweight recommendation on the stock until we can have greater faith in the
sustainability of CCL's earnings base, management's strategy and the company's competitive position in
cold drinks."(rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)
2355 GMT [Dow Jones] Offshore accounts at 5 foreign brokerages place net sell orders for 1.5 million
Japanese shares overnight, according to traders. The first day of premarket selling after 6 days of buying
may be negative for the market at the open, although the yen value basis of the figures is unknown. Sell
orders total 8.8 million shares, with buy orders amounting to 7.3 million shares.

2353 GMT [Dow Jones]--Japan stocks are likely to gain ground Thursday, extending their current
year-long eight-session winning streak, as the dollar continues to ratchet higher against the yen
(USD/JPY now 102.68)--a strong buy signal for exporters. The currency market reacted to hints from
U.S. Federal Reserve officials that a surprisingly strong jobs market recovery could lead it to raise
interest rates earlier than it had been anticipating. "A strong dollar remains the single most powerful
Japan stock-buying catalyst--as clearly illustrated in 2013," says Rakuten Securities senior market
analyst Masayuki Doshida. There isn't a great deal of short-term room for more yen weakness, but there
is enough to keep the current rally going." He puts the Nikkei's range for the session at 15450 to 15600.

2350 GMT [Dow Jones] The M&A drums are beating louder for Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AU), which is
cash rich due to strong revenues from its Australian gas-export projects and the recent rejection by
minority shareholders of a US$2.68 billion buyback of most of Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSB) stake in the
company. Macquarie notes Woodside is now speaking of less competition for assets and more
reasonable prices. At the same time, Woodside's targeted deal size appears to be drifting higher to US$5
billion, from previous guidance of US$1 billion to US$5 billion. "All of which seemingly points to
nearer-term newsflow on the acquisition front," Macquarie says. It figures Woodside could fund a
US$$8.5 billion cash acquisition while keeping gearing under the 30% ceiling. "What's more,
depending on the asset's subsequent capex requirements, the payout ratio could potentially also remain
at 80%," Woodside says. WPL last traded at A$43.38. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
2327 GMT [Dow Jones]--Treasury Wine (TWE.AU) just scrapes over the line to hit the bottom end of its
FY guidance, potentially taking pressure off the private-equity firms bidding for the vintner to raise their
evenly-matched 3.38-billion-Australian dollar (US$3.14 billion) offers. Operating earnings of A$184.6
million missed the company's own A$190 million-A$210 million guidance range, but would have been
A$193 million had FX rates remained steady as assumed by the company. One of the suitors is a
venture between KKR & Co. and Rhone Group LLC, while a person familiar with the matter has named
TPG as behind the second offer. Both approaches are indicative and subject to completion of due
diligence. For now, it's uncertain whether either bidder will raise their initial A$5.20-per-share offer, or
walk away. TWE was last at A$5.33. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2326 GMT [Dow Jones] Comments by Woodside (WPL.AU) CEO Peter Coleman poured cold water on
the prospect of large-scale capital management, says J.P. Morgan, noting he highlighted Woodside's
growth bent by talking up the prospect of M&A worth US$5 billion. The CEO said more assets are
coming on the market as Woodside's peer group refocuses toward America and some of the sector
majors look to improve their balance sheet. Meanwhile, prices are improving as the appetite of national
oil companies for deals fades. J.P. Morgan forecasts Woodside will be in a net cash position by year end
and a US$5 billion acquisition would see net gearing at a very manageable 22%. Lifts price target to
A$41.17 from A$40.69, keeps Neutral rating. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2325 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank of America Merrill Lynch keeps its underperform rating and A$37.50 target
price on Wesfarmers (WES.AU) as it trades at 22 times expected FY15 earnings, yet earnings are
expected to fall next year. "In fiscal 2014, four Wesfarmers businesses went backwards in earnings--and
in fiscal 2015 (combined with the elimination of Insurance earnings), three businesses are forecast to go
backwards," the broker says. "For a conglomerate to deliver above market growth in earnings, to justify a
premium valuation, we believe none of its businesses should post negative growth." WES last A$45.66.

2310 GMT [Dow Jones]--USD/JPY may trade in a 103.50-104.00 range during Asian trading after it
climbed higher following the release of minutes from the most recent FOMC meeting. The minutes
showed the U.S. central bank was gradually shifting its stance in a more hawkish direction. "Eyes will
now be on Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's speech Friday at Jackson Hole," says Junichi Ishikawa,
market analyst at IG Securities. He said the pair could test the Y104 level and key resistance at Y104.13
if Yellen sticks to a hawkish tone. "Until then, I think we will be seeing the pair moving in a narrow range,"
he says. He tips EUR/USD in a 1.3230-1.3300 range. USD/JPY is at 103.73, and EUR/USD is at 1.3258.

2302 GMT [Dow Jones] The latest move by Brazil's central bank to spur greater lending may not do the
trick according to Fitch Ratings. The reasons: Brazil's banks are nervous about deteriorating borrower
credit quality as the country's economy slows. The central bank on Wednesday eased reserve
requirements on certain deposits, the second time in a month that it has done so in an effort to jumpstart
growth. But Fitch says Brazil's bankers are growing more conservative. The country's largest private
banks, for example, are targeting higher-quality borrowers and looking to make shorter-term loans. Most
analysts expect Brazil's economy to grow less than 1% this year; some are predicting recession.

2300 GMT [Dow Jones]--Westpac Banking's (WBC.AU) third-quarter capital update indicates its
asset-quality metrics continue to improve and domestic housing-credit growth has returned to the levels
of the wider financial system, says J.P. Morgan. On the back of that, the brokerage is nudging up its
fiscal 2014 earnings forecast by slightly less than 1% to just under A$7.6 billion--which still leaves it
modestly below consensus. It remains overweight and raised its price target to A$35.38/share from
A$34.99. WBC last traded at A$34.88. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
