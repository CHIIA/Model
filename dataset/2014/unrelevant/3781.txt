HISTORICAL artefacts from former timber mills have been preserved and gone on show at the
renamed Cairns Home Improvement Centre at Portsmith.
The Lancini Property and Development project, previously known as the Cairns Homemaker Centre,
has been listed as a place of local heritage value.

Lancini marketing executive Karlie Armansin said the site incorporated four locations where various
historical artefacts retained from the original plywood and timber mill factories could be viewed.

“The artefacts include an original ply press and part of an original gantry crane,’’ she said.

“Timber retained from the original building structure has also been used to create seating and timber
features in a communal area.’’ Ms Armansin said the site was first bought in 1888 by migrant Sarah Ah
Ching. After passing through various hands Cairns Timber bought the land in 1939 and it was left
undeveloped until the mid-1940s when the company built a second plywood factory operated by
Cairns Plywoods, she said.

In February 1946 a fire destroyed the plywood factory leaving only the air drying sheds along Draper St
intact. A new factory was built.

A shed housing a drying kiln was constructed in the late 1950s at the rear of the ply mill and in 1964
Cairns Plywoods was sold to Rankin Bros.

The mill was kept operational, producing plywood and ice cream scoops punched from plywood and
covered in beeswax for use by Peters Ice Cream.
Cairns Plywoods ceased all operations at the site in the early 1990s. In 2008 the site was bought by
Lancinis and in 2011 was subdivided into two lots.

This was to allow construction of the Masters Home Improvement Store which opened in September
2012. Anaconda and Sushi Roll King are currently open and trading at the centre with Curtain
Wonderland, Nick Scali and Sportscene due to open later this year.

Ms Armansin said some tenancies were still available.■ For more information, contact Hanna Peard on
