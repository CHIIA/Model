The directors

Resources stocks highlighted directors' trades this week, with the overall scorecard registering $4.2
million to $4.9 million in favour of buyers.

Heading proceedings was Stewart Elliott, chairman and managing director of Energy World
Corporation, which produces and sells power and natural gas.
The buying was done by Hong Kong-based Energy World International which Mr Elliott founded; it
now holds about 37 per cent of Energy World Corporation's capital.
On the selling side of the ledger was Guido Staltari, chairman of gold producer Saracen Mineral. Most
of the shares were sold by his superannuation fund and he said the sales were required to meet tax
commitments and to rebalance the portfolio to meet legislative requirements.
He retains $4.4 million of scrip; he doesn't plan to sell any shares in the near future.
Elsewhere on the mining front, three directors bought shares in Mineral Deposits, which owns half of
a mineral sands deposit in Senegal, West Africa and an ilmenite upgrading facility in Norway.
Heading the line-up was Nicholas Limb, the executive chairman who set up the company and has
been on the board for about two decades.

Mr Limb, managing director Richard Sharp and non-executive director David Isles paid $1.42-$1.50 a
share - the lowest prices for many a long day.

Peter McMorrow, newly appointed chairman of Structural Systems, which operates in the construction
and resources sectors, increased his stake by 30 per cent.

The scrip was sold down by about 70 per cent in 2012-13 and has since doubled off its 31¢ low.
Valued by the market about $37 million, the group is forecasting current year pre-tax earnings of $6.7
million-$7.5 million.

In coming days, David Macgeorge takes the managing director's reins. He recently was with
KKR-owned Bis Industries, a provider of logistics and materials handling services.
