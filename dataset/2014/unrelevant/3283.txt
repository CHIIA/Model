DAIRY: China's Bright Food Group is the latest foreign player to carve itself a slice of the local
dairy sector, signing a deal to buy privately held WA cheese and yoghurt producer Mundella.
Bright Food spokesman Pan Jianjun was reported to have said the state-owned company was
buying Mundella via its wholly owned Australian subsidiary Manassen Foods, which it acquired in
2011.

Bright has also been touted as a possible buyer of Australia's largest privately owned milk supplier
United Dairy Power. But UDP general manager Darryl Cardona has said the Chinese firm has
made no approaches.

The terms of the Mundella sale have reportedly been agreed but the final price will be based on the
target company's financial performance for last year, which is yet to be reported.

The local sector has drawn great interest from foreign investors seeking to cash in on rampant
demand from Asia for dairy foods as more Western diets become popular, as do products such as
baby formula.
The deal comes as the battle for Warrnambool Cheese & Butter remains a two-way contest.
Canadian dairy major Saputo extended its $504 million takeover offer on Friday after securing a
25.445 per cent stake.

The Saputo offer now closes next Wednesday -- more than two weeks before the Australian
Competition Tribunal is scheduled to hold a week-long hearing on whether a rival $530m offer from
Murray Goulburn Co-operative should be allowed to proceed.

Saputo has urged WCB shareholders to ``take action immediately'' by accepting its offer of $9 a
share, rising to $9.20 should it secure 50 per cent of the company and to $9.60 upon achieving 90
per cent.

Murray Goulburn has urged Warrnambool investors to delay a decision until the outcome of its
tribunal hearing, while major WCB shareholders Bega Cheese and Lion have yet to declare what
they will do with their stakes.
Founded in 1974, Mundella makes soft cheese and yoghurt, and has begun exporting to Asia. It
has about 40 staff.
