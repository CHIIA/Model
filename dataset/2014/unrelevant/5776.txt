The collapse in global dairy prices could offset Fonterra's elevated spending on new plants and allow
the dairy giant to pay bigger dividends, analysts say.

In 2013-14, Fonterra, which is listed in Australia and New Zealand, was forced to cut its dividend after
the boom in milk powder prices put a rocket under the farmgate milk price.

The milk price Fonterra pays its dairy farmers, the majority of whom are New Zealand-based, is
regulated by reference to certain dairy product prices and is a cost of goods sold.
According to JPMorgan, global auction prices for a range of New Zealand's traded dairy products
have fallen 40 per cent to 50 per cent since the peaks at the turn of the year.
Craigs Investment Partners analyst Adrian Allbon thinks the cooling in dairy commodities will help
Fonterra and the lower milk price gives "scope for Fonterra earnings and dividend upgrades".
Fonterra is spending $NZ1.6 billion ($1.5 billion) on capital expenditures this year, raising concerns
about its capital allocation policies and ability to increase its returns. But Mr Allbon expects 2014-15 to
be the peak for capital spending and that Fonterra will become more transparent about return on
capital requirements.
The Chinese retail dairy market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10 per cent over
the next five years to about $US140 billion ($165 billion) as China's middle class grows and dietary
habits change. But its milk production is expected to grow 3 per cent a year, resulting in a shortage of
about 20 billion litres by 2020.
The big opportunity for Fonterra is expanding into higher-value dairy products to lift group returns.
But there is some doubt in the industry that Fonterra can ever move away from being primarily a big
producer of lower-returning commodities.
