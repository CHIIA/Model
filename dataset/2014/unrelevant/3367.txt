BHP Billiton said August 15 it would spin-off its unwanted assets into a separate company after the
mining giant was unable to find a buyer for its Nickel West operation in Western Australia.
The Melbourne-based company said it would focus on its “four pillars” of iron ore, copper, coal and
petroleum — with potentially a fifth in potash — and demerge its other assets (See Separate Story).

BHP had reportedly been seeking around $1 billion for its Nickel West operation, which comprises the
Kwinana refinery, Mt Keith mine, Leinster nickel plant and Kalgoorlie smelter and concentrator. It had
hoped a resurgent nickel price caused by the export ban in Indonesia from January this year would
have helped attract a buyer.
But after reviewing the company’s portfolio since April this year, the miner decided a “demerger of its
assets is our preferred option.”

In a July 14 research note resent August 15, UBS analysts said Nickel West had been “in decline for a
number of years and could potentially have a $1-2 billion environmental liability” that any purchaser
would have to take on. UBS mentioned Glencore, which operates the nearby Murrin Murrin
nickel-cobalt mine, or Chinese companies as potential buyers.

Nickel prices have increased around 30% since the start of the year, which has seen the share prices
of nickel producers such as Perth-based Western Areas more than double over the period. Indonesia
supplied around 23% of the global nickel market, and Chinese nickel pig iron producers have been
seeking alternative suppliers, notably in the Philippines.
Speaking at the Noosa Mining and Exploration Conference in Queensland last month, KPMG director
Matt Pedley said the Indonesian ban could drive some significant M&A activity among Australian nickel
companies.

In a July research note, analysts at ANZ bank said the “supply shock” caused by the Indonesian ban
that “sent nickel prices to a two year high is far from over and is likely to put further upward pressure on
prices over the next few years.”

BHP produced around 143,000 mt of nickel in the 12 months to June 30, down 7% on the previous
year. A Melbourne-based analyst said nickel was not a "material portion of the company's earnings."
