Built-To-Order project in Yishun. The project, Vine Grove @ Yishun, was launched in HDB’s July 2013
sales exercise and will yield 696 homes. The scope of work under the contract includes the construction,
completion and maintenance of five 13-storey blocks and a seven-storey block, as well as a seven-storey
garage or carpark, children’s playground and fitness stations, a neighbourhood park and other associated
works. The project is expected to start in March 2014 and will last for 31 months.

CapitaMalls Asia announced results that largely met expectations. Operating profit after tax and minority
interest (Patmi) rose 40.1% in FY2013 to $246.3 million, while total Patmi, which is made up of operating
Patmi, portfolio gains and revaluation, rose 9.9% to $600 million. CEO Lim Beng Chee says operating
Patmi for this year should increase 20% y-o-y. CMA is also likely to book in $90 million from the sale of
Westgate Tower, which is scheduled for completion in 4Q2014. The company announced it will pay out
at least 20% of its operating Patmi in dividends. It will pay a final dividend of 1.75 cents per share, taking
total dividends to 3.3 cents, giving a yield of 2%. Net tangible asset per share rose 10% to $1.84. The
e-commerce threat is driving CMA to reinvent the shopping mall concept in China as a place for the
community to gather. CapitaMall Tianfu in Chengdu, which will open in 4Q2014, will have anchor tenants
taking up 30% to 40% of the mall. They include an indoor-outdoor restaurant concept with a rooftop
garden on the sixth and seventh floors, a skating rink, a cinema operated by the Palace brand and a
supermarket. — Compiled by Gwyneth Yeo
