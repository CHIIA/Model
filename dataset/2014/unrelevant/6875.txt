15 April 2014: Business Traveller Magazine: Second Sydney airport given go-ahead
[Company Release] A second international airport will be constructed in Sydney at an estimated cost of
$2.5 billion (Pound1.4 billion), it was announced today. The new facility will be located at Badgerys Creek,
about 45km west of the Australian city's central business district. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who
revealed the news at a press conference in Canberra this morning, said construction is scheduled to begin
in 2016. The move is designed to take pressure off Sydney Airport, which has "first right of refusal to build
and operate the [new] airport", reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Debate surrounding the building of a
second airport in Sydney dates back to 1946 and has seen 20 sites up for consideration at one point of
another. Mr Abbott said: "It's a long, overdue decision which, to be honest, has been shirked and squibbed
by successive governments for far too long. "I also want to stress that the government's approach will be
roads first, airport second, because we don"t want the people of western Sydney to have an airport

welcomed the announcement. CEO Alan Joyce said: "Qantas has long supported the building of a second
airport at Badgerys Creek, as have a number of detailed studies.

ensures that our customers from the East Midlands region now enjoy the convenience that comes with
links to 52 countries served by Brussels Airlines. "This new link will bring considerable commercial benefit
to the region, not least making it easier for potential overseas investors and trade partners to visit, and our
schedule allows business travellers to make return trips between the two airports in one day, ideal for
meetings and conferences." bmiregional.com Source: Company Website
