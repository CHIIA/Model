A slew of better than expected local economic news that came hot on the heels of the best company
reporting season in three years saw local shares move higher over the past week.

The sharemarket shrugged off Monday's falls as fears abated that Russia's push into Ukraine's
Crimean peninsula could escalate into a military crisis with the potential to disrupt global oil supply and
financial markets.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index lifted 57.5 points, or 1.1 per cent, over the five sessions to
5462.3, while the broader All Ordinaries Index lifted to 5477. On Friday, the benchmark index added
0.3 per cent.
In China on Friday it was confirmed that Chaori Solar Energy had defaulted on its debt. It is the first
time China's government has allowed a national company to default.

the nadir of the market's dive during the global financial crisis.

"Given a five-year bull run, it is impossible to argue stocks look cheap, but the market is not
necessarily too high," said Brian Parker, senior investment consultant at MLC Investment
Management. "With interest rates still ridiculously low, there is an overwhelming incentive for investors
to pour more money into stocks and chase equity markets higher."

As was widely expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia elected to keep the official cash rate at its
record low 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.

"The biggest risk to equities is that over the past five years share price gains have outstripped
underlying company earnings growth," Mr Parker said. "Stocks can rise on thin air and optimism, but
they can't stay high on that alone in the long term."Recent data encouraging The good news for the
local market is that recent economic data, notably much stronger than expected retail sales and
building approvals reports released over the past week, indicates that the earnings environment is
improving, Mr Parker said.

"Australian companies have done a good job of controlling costs over the past couple of years and are
now well-placed to deliver profit growth as domestic demand accelerates."
While equity markets around the world are at or approaching fresh highs, bond markets are pricing the
prospects for the world economy more pessimistically, Ardea Investment Management portfolio
manager Tamar Hamlyn said.

"This is a hangover from quantitative easing in the US and low interest rates at home.
"The diversion is interesting. In the lead-up to the GFC, bond yields started to fall on fears of a
developing crisis well before equities started falling.
"Only time will tell if bond or equity markets are right, but we are cautiously optimistic in our outlook for
global financial markets. In Australia, the economy needs to re-balance away from mining-led growth,
which will be difficult, but all the right building blocks are now in place."

Gains in the local sharemarket over the past week were led by the big four banks. Commonwealth
Bank of Australia rose 1.8 per cent to $76, and Westpac Banking Corporation added 1.3 per cent to
$33.90. ANZ Banking Group gained 1.9 per cent to $32.58, while National Australia Bank was
unchanged over the week at $34.74.

Telstra Corporation rose 0.4 per cent at $5.07.IT up, resources down

Information technology was the best-performing sector, up 5.1 per cent as electronic share registry
Computershare hit levels not reached since April 2010 amid growing speculation from analysts that the
business is set to benefit from an uptick in corporate deal activity. Over the week, Computershare
jumped 4.5 per cent to $12.41.

Online automotive advertiser Carsales.com surged 11.8 per cent to an all-time high of $11.89, boosted
by the announcement on Thursday that it will spend $126 million on the online assets of South
Korea's largest automotive trading business, SK Encar.
The biggest miners were lower as iron ore and coal prices fell and amid growing fears of a slowdown
in Chinese demand. BHP Billiton lost 1.7 per cent to $37.72, while main rival Rio Tinto shed 2.9 per
cent to $64.94 as the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, lost 1 per cent to $US116.90 a tonne,
having dipped to an eight-month low.
Gold stocks were among the most volatile, as the precious metal's value ebbed and flowed with global
worries over the Ukraine crisis.
