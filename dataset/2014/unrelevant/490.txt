In a dramatic turnaround, the sharemarket has posted a gain for October, led by the banks, and is now
3.4 per cent ahead for the year.

The month began with shares spiralling towards a technical correction, having wiped out all the gains
of 2014 in a September slump.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index lifted 4.4 per cent in October, to 5526.6 points, while the All Ordinaries Index
added 4 per cent to 5505 points, despite weak commodity prices weighing on the resource sector as
the big four lenders rallied into bank reporting season. On Friday, the market added 0.9 per cent.
The market has shadowed the performance of equity markets in the US, the focus on rising global
interest rate expectations. On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve announced a long-awaited move
to conclude its program of extraordinary asset purchases, known as quantitative easing.

"It was good to see the US Federal Reserve end QE and sounding more positive about the economy,"
Quay Equities head of trading Tristan K'Nell said. "But while the US economy is improving, China,
Japan, Europe, and even Australia, are struggling a bit and that is driving investors back in to safe yield
plays."

ANZ added 0.7 per cent to $33.50 on Friday after reporting a 10 per cent lift in full-year cash earnings
to $7.12 billion, buoyed by continuing strength in its domestic mortgage lending business. The result
was in line with an accidental disclosure that prompted a brief trading halt earlier in the week. ANZ
recorded an 8.3 per cent gain for the month.

National Australia Bank began bank reporting season on Thursday, when it showed a 10 per cent fall in
cash earnings to $5.18 billion and confirmed it is looking to sell its poorly performing British division.
NAB shares added 7.5 per cent over the month to $34.99.

"We expect another clean, predictable high-quality result from Westpac Banking Corporation when it
reports full-year result on Monday," UBS banking analyst Jonathan Mott said. In October, Westpac
rose 8.2 per cent to $34.78.

Commonwealth Bank, which will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday, rose 6.9 per cent over the
month to $80.48.

Macquarie Group added 2.2 per cent to $61.17 on Friday as its interim profit jumped 35 per cent to
$678 million, beating forecasts. Telstra closed October 6.2 per cent ahead at $5.63.

BHP Billiton edged up 0.3 per cent to $33.96, while Rio Tinto added 1.4 per cent to $60.41, and
Fortescue Metals Group rose 0.6 per cent to $3.50. Newcrest Mining shed 11.7 per cent to $9.32 over
the month as the gold spot price slipped to $US1193.67 an ounce.
