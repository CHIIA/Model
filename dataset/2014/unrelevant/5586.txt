BC Iron and Fortescue Metals Group over July-December exported a record 3.14 million mt of iron
ore from their Nullagine joint venture in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a 38% on year jump
from 2.28 million mt, the company said Wednesday.
BC Iron's share of those exports rose to 2.46 million mt in July-December, from 1.14 million mt in the
six-month period a earlier, the miner said in its half-year report for fiscal 2013-2014. Australia's BC Iron
holds a 75% stake in the JV and Fortescue 25%.

The average realized CFR price BC Iron received for its iron ore over this period was $119/mt, higher
than the $100/mt in the year-ago period. BC Iron said Wednesday demand for its Bonnie fines product
from customers in China remains very strong with numerous inquiries received each month. "The
company considers that the outlook in relation to Chinese demand for iron ore remains robust," it
added.
Cash costs for BC Iron in the six months ending December were A$37/mt ($33/mt), significantly down
from A$52/mt for the six months ended December 2012. The company has forecast costs for
producing iron ore in fiscal 2013-2014 to be A$40-44/mt.
The Nullagine JV expects to achieve sales of 5.8 million-6.2 million mt during the fiscal year,
notwithstanding heavy rains in January and early February. BC Iron's share of this is expected to be 4.4
million-4.6 million mt.
BC Iron reported a spike in net profit for the six months ending December 2013 to A$70.3 million,
compared with A$7.7 million for the corresponding period of 2012. This was due largely to higher sales
volumes resulting from BC Iron's increase in ownership in the JV from 50% to 75% in December 2012.
Increased production capacity at the JV mine from 5 million mt/year to 6 million mt/year also
contributed, the company said.
