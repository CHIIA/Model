HONG KONG, Dec 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Australia's infrastructure M&A frenzy shows no sign of
easing. A sale by Britain's BG Group of a pipeline to APA Group for $5 billion confirms a pattern of
fiercely competitive bidding and high valuations for low-risk assets down under. Amid red-hot investor
demand, 2015 promises to be another bumper year for Australian M&A.
It's a chunky deal for APA, accounting for 56 percent of the company's current enterprise value. The
country's largest owner of gas transmission pipelines will pay a multiple of 13 times 2016 EBITDA for
the 543-kilometer conduit that links BG's gas fields in southern Queensland with Australia's eastern
coast. APA itself trades on 12.8 times, according to Eikon. The transaction will be financed by a $1.52
billion rights issue and a two-year bridge loan.
The deal comes with something of a sticker shock. Original expectations for a sale were $4 billion or
even lower. A higher final price may be partly explained by the detailed structure of the 20-year long
contract. The disposal allows BG to pay down debt and adds to $9.5 billion of capital already released
from similar disposals of non-core transmission and distribution assets over the past two years.
The country's second biggest M&A deal of the year follows a pattern set by the largest. The privatisation
of Australia's Queensland Motorways was expected to fetch less than $5 billion. It was finally acquired
in April by a consortium led by Transurban Group for $6.6 billion. APA saw off competition from
Cheung Kong Holdings, which outbid it earlier this year for local gas distributor Envestra, as well as
sovereign funds and other strategic buyers.
The auction bodes well for Australia's M&A pipeline. Local governments are planning to sell
infrastructure worth billions of dollars as they seek to raise funds to reinvest in new projects and create
jobs. Assets on the block include a 49 percent stake in the electricity distribution network of New South
Wales which alone could fetch more than $8 billion. BG's disposal confirms a strong market ahead.

wholly-owned QCLNG Pipeline through a A$1.84 billion ($1.53 billion) fully underwritten rights issue
and A$4.47 billion of debt from a two-year bridge facility.
- BG Group said that the pipeline has a current book value of $1.6 billion and that it would use the
proceeds to reduce net debt and fund future growth. APA said that it expects to maintain its credit rating
following the transaction.

commercial LNG deliveries and the approval of China National Offshore Oil Corporation for the change
of control of the pipeline.

- The QCLNG pipeline stretches 543 kilometers and links BG Group's natural gas fields in southern
Queensland to a two-train liquefied natural gas export facility at Gladstone on Australia's east coast.
