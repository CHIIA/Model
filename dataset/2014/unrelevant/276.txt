Shares advanced for the third week in a row as a flurry of corporate deal activity and initial public
offerings helped the market rally from a 1.3 per cent fall at the start of the week following a slump in
the iron ore price.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.3 per cent over the week to close at 5492 points, while the broader
All Ordinaries Index gained 0.2 per cent to 5470.3, as investors shrugged off worries about slower
demand growth from China and questions lingered about whether the sustained bull run remains
justified.

"Growth prospects for Australian corporate earnings are improving and are supportive of current
market valuations," Alphinity Investment Management portfolio manager Johan Carlberg said.

On Friday, the benchmark index added 0.2 per cent, with a solid debut from the biggest initial public
offering to hit the boards in 2014. Maintenance and catering services companySpotless Group
Holdings lifted 7.2 per cent to $1.72. Intueri Education Group rose 8.7 per cent on its IPO to $2.37.

"There has been an avalanche of new offers to consider in recent months but, as usual, the quality
has been mixed, with some priced too high," said Quest Asset Partners director and portfolio
manager, Michael Evans.

Telecommunications was the best-performing sector over the week, as Telstra Corporation advanced
5.38 per cent to a nine-year high of $5.38.

Three of the big four banks pushed higher. Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 1.1 per cent to
$81.31, National Australia Bank added 0.3 per cent to $33.57, and ANZ Banking Group lifted 2 per
cent to $33.60. Westpac Banking Corporation fell 0.3 per cent to $34.19.

"Looking ahead, investors need to be mindful of where we are in the banks' earnings cycle," Mr
Carlberg said.
Mining stocks lagged as the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, fell below $US100 per tonne for
the first time this year. Iron ore was last priced at $US98.80 a tonne.

Resources giant BHP Billiton lost 1.1 per cent to $37.65, while main rival Rio Tinto shed 1.2 per cent
to $60.54.

Junior goldminer Regis Resources was the worst-performing stock, dumping 25 per cent on Friday
after an operations update and revision to 2015 guidance disappointed analysts.
Energy stocks were mostly lower as China and Russia announced a major gas deal. Woodside
Petroleum fell 0.3 per cent to $41.61 after abandoning an Israeli joint venture, leaving investors
uncertain about how it plans to use the allocated capital.

$5.17 after the company revealed it rejected a takeover bid from private equity firmKohlberg Kravis
Roberts last month.

Retailers Woolworths and Wesfarmers were both modestly higher.
