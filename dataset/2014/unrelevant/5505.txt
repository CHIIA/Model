In order to prioritize the development of the Cash-Maple gas and condensates fields offshore
northwestern Australia, Thai PTTEP will likely have to sell all or part of its Montara oil field, also in the
Timor Sea.

"We're looking for partners for Cash-Maple and looking for anyone who would give value for Montara,"
the state-owned company's deputy CEO for exploration and development, Montri Rawanchaikul, told
the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association's annual conference in Perth,
Western Australia.

"We need to re-arrange our portfolio...we see the value in Montara, with production ramping up and the
project has been de-risked. Part of our strategy is to rearrange it, it's not essential that we pull out," he
said April 9.

The Cash-Maple fields contain an estimated 2-3 trillion cubic feet of gas, plus condensates.
The PTTEP executive said that, as a stranded offshore asset, the company was looking at both
floating LNG and pipeline options for developing Cash-Maple. "Geographically it's great because we
can take the gas back to Thailand," said Rawanchaikul.

He added that that PTTEP would like to conclude work on a development option this year, enabling a
final investment decision in 2016 and first gas in 2022.
In September 2013, PTTEP-Australasia CEO Ken Fitzpatrick said the company was hoping to reach
FID on Cash-Maple in 2015-2016 and was targeting first gas for export by end-2019 or early 2020.

Last month The Australiannewspaper reported PTTEP was seeking to sell its assets offshore Western
Australia, including both Montara and Cash-Maple.
The newspaper said Montara has been valued at $2 billion by consulting company McKinsey and
named ConocoPhillips, Woodside, Apache, Italy's Eni and China's state owned Sinopec and
PetroChina, as possible buyers.
Montara, which started producing oil in late June last year after an oil spill delayed the start-up, is
pumping some 20,000 b/d, Rawanchaikul said. All the oil is sold to the company's parent PTT
