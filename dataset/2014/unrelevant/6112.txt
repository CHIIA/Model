Media Release 28 May 2014
Energy Mad releases its FY2014 results

Energy-efficient light bulb manufacturer Energy Mad has released its preliminary results for the twelve
months ending 31 March 2014.
Energy Mad delivered operating revenues of $7.5 million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014,
compared to $9.2 million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2013.

The main cause of the fall in revenue was the lack of repurchase orders from Walgreens in the United
States as they sold through their initial stock. This saw the United States revenue fall to $0.2 million for
the 12 months ending 31 March 2014, compared to $2.5 million for the 12 months ending 31 March
2013.

Walgreens stock has now fallen sufficiently for them to have already placed two reorders totalling $0.14
million with Energy Mad for delivery in FY2015.
The Australian revenue fell to $4.0 million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014, compared to $4.6
million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2013, as a result of one large customer who reduced their
orders by $1.4 million.
In contrast, the New Zealand Direct Installation revenue grew to $2.9 million for the 12 months ending 31
March 2014, compared to $2.0 million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2013.
The European revenue grew to $0.4 million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014, compared to $0.02
million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2013.
In November 2013, Energy Mad wrote a $2.0 million deferred tax asset off its balance sheet.

This was written off because of the uncertainty of timing of sales orders and the loss for the six months
ending 30 September 2013.
At the time Energy Mad stated that this tax asset was not lost and could be utilised when Energy Mad
became profitable, as long as Energy Mad maintained a 49% minimum continuity of shareholding
between the beginning of the period in which the associated tax losses were earned and the end of the
period in which they are offset.
Energy Mad has been advised that one of its long-standing international shareholders may sell their
remaining shares in Energy Mad (as at 19 May 2014, this had not occurred). If that shareholder were to
sell a further 115,000 of their shares in Energy Mad, Energy Mad will fall below the 49% minimum
continuity of shareholding in respect of the $2.0 million deferred tax asset. This will then not be able to
be utilised upon Energy Mad becoming profitable, with gross tax losses of $7.7 million being lost.
However, because the founding shareholders have maintained their shareholding, Energy Mad still has
gross tax losses of $12.4 million ($4.7 million if the $7.7 million of gross tax losses described above are
lost) available to be utilised when Energy Mad becomes profitable (subject to maintaining a 49%

Page185of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.minimum continuity of shareholding between the beginning of the period in which these tax losses were
earned and the end of the period in which they are offset).
Energy Mad has impaired $1.4 million of its research and development intangible asset. This values
Energy Mad's research and development intangible asset at $0.4 million as at 31 March 2014.
This impairment covers Energy Mad's earlier research and development into selected Compact
Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs), which Energy Mad is now superseding with growing sales of Energy Mad's
new range of Ecobulb LEDs.
Energy Mad is also making a stock provision in the year end accounts of $0.2 million in respect of some
of its CFL stock. This is because of its transition to its new Ecobulb LEDs.

The reduction in revenue, the deferred tax write-off, the impairment in the intangible asset and the stock
provision resulted in a 12 month after tax loss of $5.7 million ($3.7 million operating loss before tax).
This compared to a loss of $2.5 million ($2.0 million operating loss before tax) for the 12 months ending
30 March 2013. The operating loss of $3.7 million without the effect of the impairment charge and stock
provision is $2.1 million compared to $2.0 million in the previous year. The increase in loss of $0.1
million over the previous year is despite revenue being down $1.7 million.
The deferred tax write-off, impairment in intangibles and the stock provision has no impact on Energy
Mad's cash position for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014 or its carried forward tax losses.
The Energy Mad Directors and Management know the FY2014 loss and previous losses are
disappointing for its shareholders.

The Directors and Management have invested considerable resource into developing and implementing a
strategic focus for Energy Mad that it believes will deliver a growing and profitable company. This
strategic focus is outlined later in this Media Release.

Grid. The second of these sold 2,200 of Energy Mad's energy saving Walgreens "Ology" light bulbs in
February 2014.

o Commenced an LED trial in 10 Walgreens stores in New Jersey in May 2014, with these LEDs heavily
discounted by utility funding from the State of New Jersey's Clean Energy Program.
o Commenced selling its energy saving bulbs through Amazon United States in late January 2014.
o Delivered $0.4 million of spiral Ecobulbs to its German Distributor Eisen-Fischer, with the bulk of these
order supplying a major German Supermarket chain.

factory, while retaining its preferential supply arrangements.
o Secured a $2.25 million Convertible Note facility from SuperLife Limited in February 2014.

o Delivered cost reductions (excluding the costs attributable to the growth in Direct and excluding the
foreign exchange) of $0.9 million for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014, compared to the 12 months
ending 31 March 2013.
Strategic Focus on Energy Mad's Strengths
As a result of extensive work by the Directors and Management, Energy Mad is shifting its strategic focus
to a new LED sales model and developing new LED Ecobulbs, while outsourcing elements of its
operations to an international third party field force.

Page186of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.This is intended to allow Energy Mad to deliver profitable growth on a leaner overhead structure.

New Zealand Direct Installations of Downlights
Energy Mad's Direct Installation business sells and installs Ecobulb Downlights and associated insulation
in New Zealand homes. This can cut home power bills by up to 25%.

There are around 900,000 homes in New Zealand with inefficient incandescent and halogen downlights.
Given this market potential, Energy Mad is implementing further improvements over upcoming months to
grow the sales and profitability of this business.

New LED Ecobulb Direct to Consumer Sales Model in New Zealand
Energy Mad has successfully piloted a direct to consumer LED Ecobulb sales model in New Zealand.
This model sells Energy Mad's new LED Ecobulbs that use up to 90% less electricity than the inefficient
light bulbs they replace, while lasting up to 25 times longer.

This LED Ecobulb direct to consumer sales model involves an outsourced field force demonstrating
Energy Mad's LED Ecobulb light bulbs in consumer homes, then calculating the electricity savings for
that consumer from replacing their old light bulbs with Ecobulb LEDs.

The current low uptake of LEDs in New Zealand, combined with little competition in the direct to
consumer space, creates a significant market opportunity that Energy Mad is well positioned to take
advantage of.
Energy Mad plans to aggressively scale-up this direct to consumer LED Ecobulb sales model throughout
New Zealand by utilising the large size of the outsourced field force.
Australian Energy Efficiency Schemes
Australia continues to provide growth potential for Energy Mad in Victoria, the Australian Capital
Territories and the South Australian State Government electricity utility energy efficiency schemes.

Spiral Ecobulb Sales:
Energy Mad has grown its customer base from 6 accredited energy efficiency scheme providers for the
Victorian and South Australian State Government schemes at the start of FY2013 to 19 accredited
providers as at the time of this release.
Future sales are being assisted by the Australian Capital Territories energy efficiency scheme. This
scheme, which started in 2013, saw its targets double for 2014.

12V Halogen Replacement Sales with LED Ecobulbs:

The 12V halogen replacement market in Victorian homes is poised for growth in FY2015 through the
Victorian Energy Efficiency Scheme.
Energy Mad has helped develop a 12V LED Ecobulb bulb that replaces 12V halogen bulbs.

This 12V LED Ecobulb recently secured 20,000 hour lifetime Victorian State Government Scheme
accreditation.

Within two days of gaining accreditation, the initial order of 12V LED Ecobulbs, worth $15,000, had been
pre-sold to Energy Mad's VEET customers. This order is due to arrive in Australia in June.

This customer demand is because of its combination of appearance, high performance, high transformer
compatibility and attractive price relative to the other 12V LEDs that have secured VEET Scheme
accreditation.

The United States
Energy Mad is focused on expanding its relationship with Walgreens and the number of electricity utility
energy efficiency projects it completes in partnership with Walgreens.
Energy Mad has funding for electricity utility projects through 1,300 Walgreens stores and is targeting to
grow these numbers during 2014.

Page187of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Utility funding allows the retail pricing of Energy Mad's light bulbs to be heavily discounted, without
impacting Energy Mad's margins.
Energy Mad recently commenced a one month LED trial in 10 Walgreens stores in New Jersey using
Energy Mad's "Ecospiral" branded reflector LEDs on standalone displays.

The reflector LEDs replace 65W incandescent reflector bulbs, while using only 10W of electricity. They
also last up to 25 years.
They are heavily discounted by utility funding from the State of New Jersey's Clean Energy Program. As
a result, shoppers in the 10 Walgreens New Jersey stores can purchase the Ecospiral reflector LEDs at
virtually the same price as the inefficient 65W incandescent reflector bulbs they replace.

There is significant potential to rollout to a larger number of Walgreens 8,000 United States stores using
utility funding if Energy Mad can get this model right.
Research has shown there are over 600 million incandescent reflector lamps in the United States and
replacement with LED reflector bulbs would create significant energy savings.
Energy Mad recently signed a Sales and Marketing Agreement with Advantage Sales and Marketing
("Advantage") in the United States.

Advantage procures new sales on behalf of manufacturers from United States retailers and is paid a
commission on the sales they generate for these manufacturers.
Advantage employs 38,000 people and generates US$59 billion in sales for manufacturers through
United States retailers.

Advantage is also the exclusive provider of in-store merchandising to Walgreens.
Advantage is working with Energy Mad to grow the sales of Energy Mad's energy saving light bulbs
through Walgreens.

Advantage has strong relationships with many of the other large retailers in the United States, and is
working with Energy Mad to secure sales to selected retailers.

Innovative New Ecobulb LED Range
Energy Mad has developed and sourced a range of LEDs to supply the rapidly growing LED markets in
New Zealand, Australia and the United States.

This follows extensive testing of various LEDs available from different manufacturers throughout the
world.
Energy Mad's LEDs have market leading appearance and performance. Energy Mad's first LEDs have
been manufactured for the New Zealand, Australia and the United States markets.
Maximizing Energy Mad's Growth and Profitability
Energy Mad is focused on maximizing its growth and achieving profitability.

It believes it will become profitable through its focus on its core strengths of developing innovative sales
models matched with high performance energy saving Ecobulbs, and outsourcing elements of its
operations to a large international field force.
Energy Mad expects growth in the short term will come from the New Zealand scale-up of the Ecobulb
Downlight Direct Installation business and the LED Ecobulb direct to consumer sales model with the
outsourced field force.

Additional growth will come in Australia through the ramp-up of the 12V halogen replacement market in
the Victorian Energy Efficiency Scheme, and in the United States through Walgreens, electricity utility
projects and the introduction of Energy Mad's LEDs.
We would like to thank our team and shareholders for their ongoing efforts and support for Energy Mad
during the challenging last few years.
