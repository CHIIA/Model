Virgin Australia Holdings will maintain a majority stake in its Velocity loyalty business even if
part-owner Affinity Equity Partners chooses to exit its 35 per cent stake via a float or trade sale three
years from now, says Velocity chief executive Neil Thompson.

Virgin last week revealed to new bondholders that the private equity could choose to exit three years
after the $336 million purchase closed last month, although Virgin would have the first right of
refusal in certain circumstances and the right to participate in Affinity's exit mechanisms.
Mr Thompson said it was too early to say whether a float or trade sale of part of Velocity was likely.

"It is very, very early days to say what might or might not happen," he told Fairfax Media on Monday
after Velocity unveiled a new partnership with petrol retailer BP.

Mr Thompson exited the Velocity board in the wake of the Affinity deal but Virgin chief executive
chairman John Borghetti is the chairman. The other members include Virgin chief financial officer
Sankar Narayan, Sydney-based Affinity partner Brett Sutton and Hong Kong-based Affinity chairman
Kok Yew Tang.

Rival Qantas Airways in August announced it would keep full control of its frequent-flyer program
after investigating a potential float of a minority stake. But Virgin believes having a partner could help
it grow its program from 4.5 million members to 7 million by 2017. Qantas has 10.3 million
members of its loyalty program, which is much older than Velocity.

The new partnership with BP will allow Velocity members to earn points when buying petrol and retail
items at the oil company's 1400 service stations across Australia. It will be Virgin's first
points-earning partnership for everyday spending, along the lines of the deal Qantas has with retailer
Woolworths, although Velocity members can also earn points on purchases through linked credit
cards.

Details of how Velocity members will earn points with BP will be announced before the program
begins in the first quarter of next year. Mr Thompson said options included basing it on dollars spent
or on the number of litres of petrol purchased.

Mr Thompson said Velocity would continue to unveil new partnerships to make the program more
attractive. It will also consider raising debt financing to help it further invest in technology, marketing
and more employees.

He said the Velocity website would also continue to add features, such as being able to redeem
points through bookings from all of the program's airline partners.
