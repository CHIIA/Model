News of the week
Stockland's takeover plans for Australand Property Group took another turn when its revised and final
A$2.5 billion bid was trumped by Singapore's Frasers Centrepoint Ltd.

TD

The Singapore-listed midcap developer backed by Thai beer billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi on
June 4 made an A$4.48-per-security, all-cash offer to acquire Australand that values the target at A$2.6
billion. This compared to Stockland's offer that valued the smaller rival at about A$4.35 per security.
The Australand board intends to recommend the Frasers offer if no superior offer eventuates and has
granted Frasers an exclusive four-week period to conduct due diligence, leaving Stockland in the lurch.
Frasers' offer is subject to receiving 50.1% acceptance and Foreign Investment Review Board approval.
If successful, the deal will allow Frasers to own Australand's A$2.4 billion of residential and commercial
properties and A$9.3 billion of developments in Australia. The firm is accelerating its diversification efforts
amid a challenging housing market in Singapore and said it viewed Australia as its "core market."

On the other side, Stockland will be on the prowl for other acquisition opportunities, including perhaps
some Australand assets, and it will likely off-load its 19.9% strategic stake in Australand to realize about
A$80 million of profit.

M&A news

Singapore giant CapitaLand Ltd. said it now holds more than 90% of subsidiary CapitaMalls Asia Ltd. and
will be taking it private. The company's shares will be suspended from trading June 9 after CapitaLand
agreed to acquire 3,614,324,178 shares, or 92.7% of listed share capital.

By way of explanation, CapitaLand CEO Lim Ming Yan said in a news release: "With the delisting of CMA,
the group's simplified structure and 'One CapitaLand' strategy will provide us with a strong platform to
seize opportunities in integrated developments. We will be able to better leverage resources across the
group's businesses to maximize overall project returns."

Other activity
* Pressure is on Westfield Retail Trust investors to approve Westfield Group's controversial A$70 billion
restructuring plan now that the reconvened meeting date is set for June 20. Westfield founder Frank Lowy
vowed to list a rival group to hold its Australian and New Zealand business if the proposal does not
proceed.
Westfield Retail Chairman Richard Egerton-Warburton threatened that the "plan B" company would be
more attractive to investors with its internalized management platform and an almost identical property
portfolio to Westfield Retail. However, UniSuper, Westfield Retail's largest shareholder with an 8.49%
stake, most recently said the rival group would not necessarily harm Westfield Retail. Lowy's spinoff
would have high debt levels due to the restructuring costs and would be forced to sell off assets, and
Westfield Retail would be first in line to pick up any assets it would need to sell due to its pre-emptive
rights, according to UniSuper's letter to investment clients.

with partners over the next decade in Minato ward, Tokyo, as the city prepares for the Olympic Games in
2020.
* Australia's Goodman Group has kicked off rollout of a US$1.4 billion development pipeline in key U.S.
