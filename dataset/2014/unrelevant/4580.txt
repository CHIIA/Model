Norton Gold Fields will mop up the remaining shares in Bullabulling Gold in coming weeks before
starting the process to de-list its latest acquisition from the ASX.
The $28 million hostile takeover closed on Monday with Norton in control of 90.96 per cent of
Bullabulling shares.

It follows Norton’s successful acquisition of Kalgoorlie Mining Company last year, handing the
Chinese-backed gold miner control of the Bullant underground mine.
Chief executive Dianmin Chen said the addition of Bullabulling’s 3.7 million ounce project near
Coolgardie would significantly increase Norton’s mineral resources inventory, which stand at
6.94Moz.
Norton will rely on compulsory acquisition powers in the Corporations Act to acquire the
remaining Bullabulling shares, which Dr Chen has warned will be virtually worthless without a
liquid market to trade.

It is expected to take at least a month to acquire the last remaining interests in Bullabulling, which
will cease trading on London’s AIM market from October 9.

The cancellation of Bullabulling from the ASX boards will follow.
