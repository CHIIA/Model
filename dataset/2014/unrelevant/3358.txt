Sydney (Platts)--18Jul2014/227 am EDT/627 GMT (Updating with analyst comment)
Australian exploration and production company Santos produced 12.8 million barrels of oil equivalent
in the second quarter of 2014, up 3% year on year, following the startup in April of the Papua New
Guinea LNG project.

Santos holds 13.5% of the ExxonMobil -operated PNG LNG project, which has a capacity of 6.9 million
mt/year at two production trains. The $19 billion project began producing well ahead of its scheduled
October startup date and had shipped seven cargoes by the end of the quarter, Santos said Friday.
Santos' Q2 production compared with an output of 12.4 million boe in the corresponding period of 2013
and was 5% higher than the 12.2 million boe pumped in the first three months of this year.
In the first half of 2014, Santos' output totaled 25 million boe, up 2% from 24.5 million boe in the
corresponding period of 2013.
The company's sales revenue was A$974 million ($910.36 million) for the second quarter and A$1.89
billion for the first half of the year, up 22% and 25% respectively compared with 2013.

"Delivery of the PNG LNG project is an important milestone for Santos in our journey to becoming a
major LNG supplier to Asia," Managing Director and CEO David Knox said. "This project will significantly
lift Santos' LNG production once the project reaches full output, and we are already seeing the
contribution it is making."
Santos also holds a 30% operating stake in the 7.8 million mt/year Gladstone LNG project in eastern
Australia. The coalseam gas-to-LNG project is budgeted to cost $18.5 billion from the final investment
decision to the end of 2015, when the second train is expected to be ready for startup.

"GLNG continues to make good progress, it remains on budget and we are on track to deliver first LNG
in 2015," Knox said. First commissioning gas is expected to be delivered to the LNG plant on Curtis
Island, Queensland, in the fourth quarter of 2014.

"GLNG project guidance on cost and schedule remains unchanged, but we continue to be skeptical on
the project given our cautious view on coalseam gas well deliverability and reserves," Hong
Kong-based analysts with Bernstein Research said in a note Friday.

Santos drilled 42 coalseam gas wells in Queensland as part of the GLNG project during the second
quarter, taking its total to 827, according to Bernstein. The company needs to drill 173 more wells
before GLNG startup to achieve its estimated target of 1,000 wells, the analysts added.

"During the quarter, GLNG executed two third-party gas supply agreements for an aggregate quantity of
85 petajoules (1.5 million mt)," Bernstein said. The analysts added that given the forecast reserves
shortfall, Santos was "increasingly likely to be forced into purchasing more third-party gas to meet
contractual obligations."
Santos expects to produce between 52 million and 57 million boe in 2014. The company is Australia's
third-largest oil and gas producer behind BHP Billiton and Woodside Petroleum .
