Logistics: Scottish oil and gas services company ASCO has acquired a 60 per cent stake in
Perth-based onshore oil and gas logistics and services company Bonnie Rock Transport for $28
million.
It is the Aberdeen-based company’s third Australian acquisition since it began operating here four
years ago, and it is looking for more, says ASCO Australasia chief executive Matt Thomas.

“We’re always on the lookout for suitable bolt-on acquisitions, especially in oil and gas related
services,” Thomas told Data Room.
ASCO acquired Darwin-based marine supply company Shore Base and Brisbane-based Oniqua, a
global inventory management company, and was awarded a 20-year management contract to operate
the newly constructed Darwin Marine Supply Base on behalf of the Northern Territory
government.Bonnie Rock Transport, says Thomas, specialises in the mobilisation of onshore oil and
gas platforms but also provides catering and camp services. It has depots in Perth, Dampier, Dongara
and Broome in Western Australia, as well as Chinchilla in Queensland.
