Corporate
US$230 million sale of the Jiangsu Plant
On 30 April 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a Binding Share Purchase Agreement
("SPA") signed with Sichuan Tianqi Lithium Industries Inc. ("Tianqi") for the sale of 100% of the Jiangsu
Lithium Carbonate Plant ("Jiangsu Plant"). The transaction is based on an enterprise value of US$230
million, comprising cash consideration of US$122 million and assumption of all Chinese debt (US$108
million) by Tianqi. The agreement will be effected by way of the sale of 100% of the shares in the
Company's wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Galaxy Lithium International Limited ("Galaxy
International") which is the 100% shareholder of Galaxy Lithium (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd ("Galaxy Jiangsu"), the
owner of the Jiangsu Plant. The final enterprise value and therefore cash consideration is subject to any
working capital adjustments at Galaxy Jiangsu between the date of execution of the SPA and the closing
date.

Galaxy expects that completion of the SPA will take approximately 3 months as the transaction is subject
to Galaxy and Tianqi shareholder approvals, as well as regulatory approvals in China for Tianqi.

Tianqi holds a significant range of assets in the lithium sector. It is a leading producer of lithium products in
China and has also recently acquired a majority interest in Talison Lithium, which owns the Greenbushes
lithium operations in Western Australia.

Jiangsu Plant reduced its operation rate while the Company was formulating the long-term strategy of
Jiangsu.

During the quarter, Galaxy Jiangsu entered into a spodumene tolling agreement with Tianqi, to treat 8000
tonnes of lithium carbonate (battery and technical grade) on their behalf. The toll agreement is for an initial
the period of 12 months commencing on 13th March 2014, with an option for further extension. Tianqi will
pay a toll treatment fee to Galaxy Jiangsu, which will be responsible for production costs, excluding the
cost of packaging.

Safety

There were zero LTIs (Lost Time Incidents) and MTIs (Medical Treatment Incidents) during the quarter.

Projects

Sal de Vida (96%)

The Sal de Vida project continued to progress its environmental permitting work. The project has reduced
operating expenditures to a nominal level while in this preparation stage. Engineering, construction
planning, early-stage owners EPCM team recruitment and IT initiatives continued.

Engineering and construction

Engineering: Work continues towards refining the conceptual engineering for the project to accommodate
development alternatives. This provides a positive opportunity to optimise the development and market
entry plan for the project, as well as optimising some of the earlier engineering concepts.

Organisation: An important part of the early planning process has been a review of the next phase
organisation structure, and identification of candidates for the owner's management team. Candidates
currently being considered for the owners EPCM team include managers for construction, procurement,
contractor management, process and ponds and control.
The organisation structure, a revised development schedule and the operations design itself is (and will
be) driven by both a "modular" expansion concept to seamlessly ramp up from the early development
alternatives to the full-scale operation, and by the distinctly different engineering and procurement lead
times for the different elements of the conceived operations. Work is progressing across the various
operational streams including liming ponds and plant, well field, evaporation ponds, lithium carbonate plant
and Infrastructure.

Process test work: New developments in process test work include advances on consideration of renting
the Lithium Americas pilot plant, and seeking the assistance of test laboratories for the parts of the process
that have yet to be tested on a pilot scale. This work continued during the quarter.

SGS Lakefield and Hazen research Inc have both expressed an interest in assisting with ion exchange "IX
"and bicarbonate purification "BiC" test plans.
Operations planning (reagents): An initial reduced scale will help simplify the sourcing, transporting and
storing of reagents. Recent infrastructure developments will also potentially simplify and reduce costs of
supply for both lime (CaO) and soda ash (Na2CO3).

In addition to a reduced initial scale, the aforementioned public infrastructure works should facilitate more
efficient lime supply while reducing overall costs. The improved road to the project from the south could
mitigate peak demand requirement, and alleviate seasonal tightness of lime supply from Jujuy. Additionally
Cameuse, the Belgian-based lime company has been expanding in Northern Chile.

Improved southerly access will also enhance alternative sources of soda ash supply via the Campana port
in Buenos Aires, Bahia Blanca, or even more southerly ports in Chile.

Alternative lime and soda ash supply may also become available by way of improved rail access from the
Chilean network directly serving Galaxy's proposed logistics facility.

IT and information management

While continually improving the Project Group's data management systems and procedures, the local IT
staff/contactor have designed and are implementing, with the accounting staff, a modular application to
improve cost control and capability with respect to generation of various statistical and financial reports.

Page140of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Mt Cattlin and James Bay (100%)

Mt Cattlin and James Bay are being assessed with respect to the optimal short to mid-term strategy for
each asset. Necessary activities to maintain the projects in good standing have been maintained.

Marketing & Sales

Lithium Carbonate Sales & Product Qualification

Total lithium carbonate sales for the quarter (Jan-Mar 2014) were 745.5 tonnes of technical and battery
grade product. The sales in the first quarter of 2014 decreased 55.8% compared with the fourth quarter in
2013.

Lithium Carbonate Demand

Strong indications of future demand were seen in the quarter, with several substantial future investments in
lithium battery making capacity announced:
* Samsung (SDI) confirmed an investment of US$600 million in China's Shaanxi province to build China's
largest manufacturing base of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. .
* LG Chem CEO, Mr Park Jin-soo, that the South Korean company was considering building an electric
vehicle battery plant in China, expecting Beijing's efforts to tackle air pollution to drive demand.
* Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, forecast the company will be making cars in the
country in the next three to four years.
* A record Seventy-nine new-energy vehicles are on exhibition at the 2014 Beijing International
Automotive Exhibition, according to the secretariat of the event.
Sourcing data from the China Automobile industry, for the first quarter of 2014, China HEV production and
sales is about 2627 units, EV 4024 units. Compared with the first quarter figures from 2013, of only 300
units of HEV and 2690 of EV units, the 120% increase reflects the incentives put in place by the
Government.

Pricing

According to Asia Metal Pty Ltd, during the quarter, technical grade product average prices fell from
US$6,200/t to US$5,950/t (inclusive of VAT) due to the recommencement of supplies from two Chinese
brine producers. The average prices for battery grade lithium carbonate in China also dropped from
US$6,870/t to US$6,770/t (inclusive of VAT) towards the end of the quarter.

Outlook
The transaction involving the 100% sale of the Jiangsu Plant is a major step in the financial transformation
of the Company. The new Board and executive management team at Galaxy have been entirely focused
on the best ways to reduce the interest bearing debt of the Company without further diluting shareholders
equity. Completion of the sale of the Jiangsu Plant will leave the Company in a strong financial position
with an increase in shareholder's equity. Upon closing, the entire US$108 million of Chinese bank debt
will have been assumed by the purchaser of Jiangsu and based on the initial cash consideration of
US$122 million, after deducting all remaining interest bearing liabilities at the corporate level, the
Company will be holding a pro forma net cash position of approximately A$62 million.
Following the divestment of the Jiangsu Plant, the Company will have a transformed balance sheet, but
will also continue to retain significant exposure to the lithium sector, through its portfolio of lithium assets -
namely the Sal de Vida lithium and potash brine project (96%), Mt Cattlin spodumene mine (100%) and
James Bay pegmatite project (100%). Management will continue to investigate the best ways to unlock
value from these projects and will begin to focus on the advancement of the Sal de Vida project as a
priority.
