ONE of Australia’s best known counter-cyclical buyers Sentinel Property Group has scored in its
first sales foray offloading three assets worth more than $70 million to a Sydney-based fund
manager.
They were sold to Centuria Property Funds Ltd for its new ASX-listed REIT. Sentinel managing
director Warren Ebert said the sale was an important milestone.

“We identified that it was an opportune time to test the market with these properties and the fact that
all three were sold at a solid capital gain above market valuations is a great result for investors,” he
said.

“Significantly, these successful sales highlight the maturing of the Sentinel model as we move
through the property cycle.” The three assets sold were: ● An office building at 555 Coronation
Drive, Toowong, bought for $28.5 million last year, was sold for $33.4 million.
● An industrial property at Granville in Sydney, bought for $13.5 million last year, was sold for
$16.118 million.
● An industrial property at Kerry Rd, Archerfield, bought for $17.6 million in 2010, was sold for
$22.172 million.

The deals were struck by CBRE’s Peter Court and Flint Davidson. Still on the acquisition trail,
Sentinel’s Countrywide Retail Trust is buying Woodlands Village Shopping Centre at suburban
Deeragun in Townsville for $11 million.

The deal was struck by JLL’s Jacob Swan and Sam Hatcher.
Meanwhile, a Chinese buyer has paid $15.5 million for a major redevelopment site at 83
Scarborough St, in Southport on the Gold Coast. The 3810sq m property is unconstrained by
height restrictions, has a commercial office building and was sold in a deal brokered by CBRE.
Also, Tatts Group is believed to have agreed to sell its long-term Albion property, on Brisbane’s
northside, to Singapore buyer Lian Huat for about $40 million in an off-market deal brokered by JLL.
The 8772sq m site at 240 Sandgate Rd will be a long-term residential development project for the
new owner.Sydney-based Denison Funds Management is believed to be buying an office building
at 200 Creek St, Spring Hill, for between $35 million and $40 million.
