takeovers: Stanhill Capital Partners, an investment firm based in Hong Kong, has increased its bid for
Robust Resources by 12 per cent, valuing the junior goldminer at $61.5 million. Stanhill raised its bid
price from 28c a share, made on July 1, to 31.5c and has accumulated 19.9 per cent.
Robust Resources, with gold, silver and copper assets in Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic and The
Philippines, is in the process of a reverse takeover of Mentum, a listed company on London’s AIM
market. The deal was approved by Mentum shareholders earlier this week.Under the deal with
Mentum, Robust will sell its gold and copper assets in the Kyrgyz Republic to Mentum and then hold
an 87.3 stake in Mentum, which will change its name to Tengri Resources and focus on Central Asia. It
is thought miners with a Central Asian exposure will be better valued on AIM.
