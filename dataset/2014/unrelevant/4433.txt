multibillion-dollar offers as it struggles against
low-priced competition

The Australian maker of well-known wine brands
including Penfolds, Beringer, Lindeman’s and Wolf Blass
is the subject of a multibillion-dollar takeover battle as it
fends off a glut of low-priced competition.
Melbourne-based Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. has been
struggling for a couple of years, particularly in the United
States, the world’s largest market for wine imports, as it
faces a global oversupply of low-priced Australian and
southern French wine. Last year, the company was
forced to destroy thousands of gallons of product past its
drink-by date, leading to a $160-million Australian
($162-million Canadian) writedown for 2013.

On Monday, the struggling vintner announced
(http://www.tweglobal.com/wp-
content/uploads/2014/08/TWE-announces-receipt-of-a-
competing-proposal_1352155.pdf) it had received a
second offer from an unnamed bidder to acquire the
company for approximately $3.38-billion (Australian) or
$5.20 a share. The new, non-binding offer matches one
made by New York private equity firmKohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. LP in partnership with Rhône Capital last
week. According to reports, the new bidder is Fort
Worth, Tex.-based TPG Capital.
Whichever firm wins, observers suggest they could turn
a profit either by spinning off the better-performing parts
of the business, or by refocusing the marketing of
brands that many say have become undervalued.
Treasury Wine Estates, KKR and TPG Capital all
declined to comment.

“You have properties such as Chateau St. Jean, it’s
doing a pretty good job … On the flipside you have
something like Meridian, which they have allowed to
degenerate,” said Tony Correia, founder of industry
consultancy Correia Company. That is despite the fact
that the Santa Barbara-based brand historically turned
out decent wines, and had some cachet. “... It’s on the
shelves in the [U.S.] grocery stores, and it’s always the
subject of some two-for-one sale.”

product, which has caused the entire brand to appear
more down-market.

That’s a problem for Treasury because the market for
lower-priced wines in the U.S. is highly competitive and
is not growing. By comparison, while the market for
wines over $15 is still very small, it has more growth
potential.
“It’s your classic aspirational wine market,” said Barbara
Insel, chief executive officer of Stonebridge Research
Group LLC in California, and a global industry
consultant. “And yet, the Australians have approached
the U.S. as a cheap and cheerful market. ... Maybe [the
bidders] saw a depressed [stock] price. You just have to
talk to a few people in the industry in the U.S. to see that
there’s room for improvement, and the brands are
undervalued.”
The global wine industry has seen a shift: European
wine sales have been in decline as consumers who
traditionally drank wine are moving to other beverages.
Meanwhile, wine consumption in North America has
grown. Many vintners have also marketed their brands
heavily in China, where aspirational consumers are
developing a taste for it. However, Treasury was among
the wine makers affected by a government crackdown
on gift-giving last year, which hit sales.
Treasury Wine Estates is the world’s second-largest
publicly-traded wine maker, after U.S.-based
Constellation Brands Inc. It was spun off from Foster’s
Group Ltd. – maker of Australia’s most famous lager –
in May, 2011. Foster’s has since been acquired by
SABMiller PLC.
TPG, formerly known as Texas Pacific Group, owned
Treasury’s largest brand, California-based Beringer,
before it was sold to Foster’s in 2000 for $2.9-billion.

Treasury also faces an image problem for its Australian
wines. The popularity of competing brand Yellow Tail,
which peaked in the U.S. two years ago, has cast a pall,
Ms. Insel said. Many people now associate Australian
wines with sweet shiraz, rather than complex or
high-end products. (Treasury owns more than 80 brands
produced in Australia, the U.S., New Zealand and Italy.)

Treasury does not just suffer from greater competition in
low-end wines; it also struggles with managing its
supply. Cheaper wines actually do not get better with
age, so a company that sells them cannot ride out a lull
in demand by shelving its products; hence last year’s big
dump.

Since then, observers have been waiting for takeover
bids to emerge, Mr. Correia said.

“They do have a sizable portfolio of brands and
properties,” he said. “A play could be to install some new
management … that could be a fairly long-term, and
expensive proposition, to turn this back into a highly
profitable company. It’s going to need some really
effective, strong management.”
