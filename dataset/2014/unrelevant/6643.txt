* Arrium warns outlook uncertain for iron ore recovery

* Plans to more than double share base to help pay down debt

* Share sale priced at 26 pct discount (Adds investor comment)

By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Australian iron ore miner and steel maker Arrium Ltd launched a
huge share sale to shareholders and institutions on Monday, aiming to raise A$754 million ($680
million) to pay down debt following a collapse in iron ore prices.
Iron ore prices have dived 40 percent this year to their lowest levels since 2009, hurting all but the
world's four biggest iron ore producers, who have flooded the market with new supply just as demand
growth has slowed in China.
"While the company last month reported it had achieved significant progress with debt reduction, iron
ore prices have fallen significantly in the last month to 5-year lows and there is increased uncertainty
over the extent and timing of recovery," Chairman Peter Smedley said in a statement.
Arrium's main customer for its 13 million tonnes a year of iron ore is China, where demand growth
has slowed as the housing market has cooled. Manufacturing, power generation, retail and property
investment data on the weekend reinforced fears the economy is at risk of a sharp slowdown.

Investors said it made sense for Arrium to raise the funds to pay down debt, as there had been
concerns about how it would manage its net debt of A$1.7 billion, as of June 30, with iron ore prices
likely to remain under pressure for some time.
"I don't see iron ore prices going up in a hurry. We've got to start seeing a recovery in the Chinese
building market. We're not seeing that yet," said Robert Hook, a portfolio manager at SG Hiscock &
Co, whose SGH20 high conviction fund sold its stake in Arrium before iron ore prices plunged.

"We just felt it had reached a good valuation point and we also took the view that growth rates in
China were probably going to start slowing - and I emphasise growth rates not demand - and there
would be a huge (iron ore) supply coming on the market."
Arrium, Australia's fourth-largest iron ore producer, said it was seeking to raise A$98 million through
an offer of shares to institutional investors and A$656 million from existing shareholders, more than
doubling its share base.

The offer is being pitched at A$0.48 a share, an unusually large discount of 26 percent to Arrium's last
trade.
Arrium is the biggest iron ore miner to take drastic action in face of the iron ore slump. Last week
fledgling producer Western Desert Resources called in administrators after failing to reach a deal with
bankers to pay down debt.

Smedley said would position the company well for when iron ore prices and steel volumes improve
and the Australian dollar falls.
Arrium exported 12.5 million tonnes of iron ore in the year to June 2014. Its shares have plunged 63
percent this year, slightly more than other smaller iron ore miners, to value the company at A$888
million.
The company was the target of a A$1.2 billion takeover offer two years ago led by South Korean
steel giant POSCO but rejected it as too cheap.

Arrium's shares were on a trading halt on Monday ahead of the institutional bookbuild.
