Hopu Investment Management Co. Ltd (厚樸投資管理有限公司), a private equity group based in
China, has agreed to buy a 15% stake in the Australian uranium miner Paladin Energy.
Hopu Clean Energy will subscribe to 144.9 million new shares issued by the company at A$0.42 apiece,
a 11% premium to Paladin's last closing price, for a total consideration of A$61 million.

The Foreign Investment Review Board has approved the deal, allowing Hopu to take up to 19.99% in the
uranium miner.
Paladin is also raising US$144 million in a rights issue. The combined raising plus Chinese investment
funds will be used to pay down Paladin’s convertible bonds.

John Borshoff, Paladin’s CEO, says Hopu’s investment increases Paladin’s funding options. “HOPU’s
investment demonstrates its confidence in the uranium industry and its understanding of Paladin’s unique
positioning in the uranium sector,” he says.
Borshoff says the uranium market is clearly recovering from its post Fukushima malaise. He says Paladin
is well situated to benefit from any upturn. The uranium spot price has recovered from a low of US$28 per
pound to a recent high of US$44 per pound.
Paladin believes uranium is set for a long period of price strength with China confirming its strong
commitment to its reactor fleet over the next 30 years. Paladin has been in a trading halt but the shares
last traded at US$0.38.

Hopu was set up in 2007 by FANG Fenglei (方風雷) and Richard Ong (王忠信), now of RRJ Management,
and they raised a debut fund of US$2.5 billion. The firm made a string of high-profile investments but
disbanded in late 2010 amid reports that the two principals could not get along. Fang is now raising US$2
billion for a second fund, which announced a first close of US$1.1 billion earlier this year. Hopu is
described as having strong relationships with sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors in Asia
Pacific, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East. It is also said to have considerable state-owned
enterprise backing in China.
Hopu’s Recent Overseas Deals 1. In May this year, Hopu teamed up with Baikal Mining (BMC) of Russia
to jointly develop the Udokan (烏多坎) project, the largest deposit of copper in Russia and among the
largest in the world. The agreement allows Hopu to acquire a minority share in the project by the end of
2014. 2. Hopu acquired a minority position in an agribusiness joint venture being set up by COFCO
Corporation and Noble Group. 3. Hopu participated in a consortium that pumped US$2.5 billion into
Global Logistic Properties (GLP), a Singapore-listed warehouse operator with interests in China, Japan
and Brazil.
