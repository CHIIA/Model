enabling efficient recycling of capital. The broker said while it was unlikely the company would sell the
underperforming Bowling portfolio and/or the stable but low growth Marinas business, which was possible,
deploying capital to the high growth Main Event business, this would be well received by the market.

$19.26 from $19.96. The broker said Ansell is trading below its $19.26 price target and encapsulates the
expected benefits from Barrier Safe. Increased leverage after BarrierSafe reduces scope for an increase

*AZJ: U/lying int profit up 18%, div 8c part fr, no DRP/longer term positive

MD and CEO Lance Hockridge said in the report Aurizon is driving out costs and lifting productivity across
operations in a challenging economic environment where resource investment has moderated and
general freight activity remains flat.

"We're running trains at higher velocities and with bigger payloads with lower fuel and operating costs and
a smaller maintenance footprint".

He said operational costs per net tonne kilometre decreased 11%, employee productivity increased by
20% and locomotive and wagon productivity increased 22% and 21% respectively against the prior
comparable period.
Coal revenue rose 3% with a 3% reduction in operating costs contributing to a 32% increase in underlying
EBIT. Volumes grew 13% to 109.7Mt, a record six months for Aurizon.

Page61of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Iron ore volumes rose 42% to 15 Mt and underlying EBIT increased 11% from first half 2013. The Freight
business hauled 24.6Mt during the first half, down 5% on the pcp.

Bulk volumes decreased 7% due to the end of the grain haulage contract in Western Australia in October
2012, lower Queensland grain volumes this year and other issues including the closure of a customer's
magnetite mine. Partly offsetting this was a 14% increase in Intermodal volumes.
Aurizon delivered $417 million capital investment in first half 2014 of which $215 million was on growth
projects.

Outlook

Short term headwinds remain challenging for many customers, but Aurizon's view on the medium to long
term macro economic environment remains positive.

"While the results of reform activities will fluctuate over specific periods, Aurizon remains on target to
achieve an operating ratio of 75% in full year 2015".

Analysts expectations: $245.1 mln, div 7c/$268.2 mln, div 7c/u/lying profit $258 mln up 16c, div 8c.
*On February 7 a leading broker said "very strong coal export volumes (up 15% on 1st half on pcp) will
contribute to growth in Aurizon and Asiano".

*On January 29 a leading broker had an "add" on Aurizon with a price target of $5.33, up from $5.27
earlier. The broker said it has increased its forecast EBITA across full year 2014/16 . The broker said an
upgrade to AZJ's coal haulage guidance seems likely after Aurizon reported 109.7Mt for first half 2014.
The broker said "we continue to be positive on the long term outlook for Aurizon - a potential doubling of
dividends over five years. "If the share price weakens (say on concerns of industrial unrest) use it as an
opportunity to buy stock".

*On January 28 a leading broker had a "hold" on Aurizon with a price target of $4.86 up from $4.66 earlier.
The broker said Aurizon will update its full year 2014 coal volume guidance at the first half result and
expects Aurizon to guide closer to 210/215 million tonnes than the current guidance of 200/205 million
tonnes. We believe there is upside risk to our forecasts" the broker said in the report.

AZJ up 9 cents to $5.19

*BEN: Interim cash profit up 9.5%, 31c ff div, outlook positive

Bendigo & Adelaide Bank for the half year ended December 31 2013 announced a net profit after tax

27. The DRP is available at no discount.

NTA backing per security %6.83 vs $6.62 at end June.
In events after balance date, BEN said on January 21 raised $300 million under its institutional
subordinated debt program. The debt will be fully paid, redeemable, subordinated and an unsecured debt
obligation of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. It qualifies as Tier 2 capital under the APRA Basel III capital
adequacy framework and increases total capital ratio by 96 bps.

Outlook

Managing director and CEO Mike Hirst said in the outlook statement he didn't expect any significant
change in operating conditions. He expects the focus of competition to shift from deposits to assets, and
expects the bank to compete effectively. New loan approvals grew strongly half on half. The bank
continues to lead customer satisfaction and advocacy not only on the retail brand but also Business
Banking, where the bank was voted the Best Business Bank for 9 out of the 12 months in 2013 and in
Wealth, where the Bank's SmartStart Super was awarded a five star rating by CNSTAR.

Analysts expectations: $185.7 mln, div 30c/$181.6 mln, div 31c/$190.5 mln div 33c/consensus $187 mln
div 31c.

Page62of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On February 10 Nomura said Bendigo is well positioned to deliver a solid result in 1st half 2014. While
market share trends were not particularly favorable for the regionals, we expect BEN' margin performance
to positively surprise the market. Given BEN's large reliance on retail funding (particularly TDs) it should
be well placed to deliver improving margins in first half 2014 and potentially in 2nd half 2014. Also, given
strength in the housing market BEN's headline performance should also benefit from solid contribution
from Homesafe.

price target after GEM announced the acquisition of 70 centres over 2013.
The broker said the acquisition of the latest 63 centres increases the number of GEM's Australian
centres by 27% to 296. Despite this significant interest the broker expects GEM's domestic market share
is still only 4.7% with one centre operators representing more than 80% of the market, offering significant
opportunities.

Mr Shibuya.

*UGL: U'lying NPAT $49.7 mln, no int div/evaluating offers for DTZ/positive
UGL Ltd for the half year ended December 31 2013 announced a net profit up 13.5% to $29.511 million
on revenue up 5.6% to $1.993.5 billion.
Underlying NPAT was $49.7 million excluding the effect of costs arising from acquisitions, restructuring
and in this period demerger expenses.

No interim dividend was proposed.

NTA backing per security is negative $2.30 vs negative $2.13 for the previous corresponding period (pcp).
In its review of operations the group said it experienced subdued conditions across engineering markets
in Australia with continued slowdown in capital investments in the resource and infrastructure sectors and
delays in new project awards.

Despite this UGL's diversified business model has compensated with continued growth in facilities
management and expansion of the corporate real estate business.
DTZ Property revenue rose 18% to $1.081.9 billion and generated EBIT of $58.3 million for the half
year ending December 31 2013. Global and multi regional mandates continue to build. The order book at
$3.4 billion provides a stable platform for future performance.
UGL Engineering revenue decreased 1% to $1.152.7 billion with EBIT down 40% to $35.9 million,
impacted by cost under recoveries due to delay in new project awards and margin compression.
The order book remains stable at $4.6 billion including 79% of recurring revenues.

UGL is targeting a separation of DTZ and Engineering in the 2014 calendar year.
The Board will evaluate unsolicited third party interest in DTZ to determine whether these indicative
proposals are in the best interests of shareholders.

Analysts expectations: $48.4 mln, div 17c/$46.8 mln, div 12c/$46 mln reported, underlying $61 mln, 19c
div.

*On January 29 a leading broker had an "underweight" on UGL with a price target of $5.73, up from $5.60
previously. The broker said UGL was the 4th in its preferences. WOR was the top choice followed by
Downer and TSE. Monadelphous was 5th and Leighton 6th.

The broker said in the medium term the outlook for UGL could improve with the business currently
shortlisted on a number of large infrastructure projects and the market for property services appearing
robust. In full year 2014 however we still see earnings risk as skewed to the downside as UGL's rail
division comes under pressure and cash flows and balance sheet metrics potentially disappoint.

*Another leading broker on January 17 had UGL as its No. 3 preference after Leighton and Worley. The
broker had a "hold" on UGL with a target price of $7.84. The broker said, "The stock is trading close to
trough levels, however we remain cautious given we expect guidance to be downgraded". The broker
didn't expect any change to the proposed demerger.
