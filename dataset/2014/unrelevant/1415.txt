CHINESE developer China Poly Group has swept into Australia’s apartment market planning an
aggressive $110 million acquisition of a site in Sydney’s northwest.
Backed by assets of more than $75 billion, the group follows other major Chinese and Hong
Kong-based behemoths that have recently entered the market, including Greenland Holding Group,
Country Garden, Shimao Holdings and Golden Horse Holdings.

Poly is believed to be the frontrunner on Goodman Group’s Cambridge Office Park in Epping after
outbidding rival Chinese developer Greenland.
The 8314sq m site fronting 20-28 Cambridge Street can accommodate up to 500 apartments plus
commercial space.
Poly Group, Goodman and the agents on the deal, JLL’s Sam Brewer and Ben Hunter, declined to
comment last night.
The state-owned China Poly Group has a Shanghai-listed commercial property arm, Poly Real
Estate, and a Hong Kong-listed arm, Poly Property.
Founded in 1992, the China Poly Group is one of the biggest companies in China, specialising in
international trade, real estate and art. The group reported a profit in 2012 of about $3.5bn, according
to its website, which says it and subsidiaries operate in 60 cities across 10 countries.

Poly was scouring the Australian market for more than a year in the hope of cashing in on the
Australian apartment boom. The group was reportedly in north Queensland in August for an
investment roadshow for Hong Kong billionaire Tony Fung’s $8bn Aquis mega-resort and casino near
Cairns.

It also looked at several Sydney housing sites.

Meanwhile, Goodman is cashing in on the demand for Sydney apartments by selling ageing city sites to
residential developers. The group reaped more than $350m for the sale of a site in Erskineville in
Sydney’s inner west to Golden Horse, as flagged by The Australian recently. The 7ha Erskineville site
has the potential for about 1765 residential dwellings.Goodman has said it has $500m of urban
renewal sites on the market, under due diligence or sold in Australia and Britain. It holds industrial
parks with the potential to be converted into more than 35,000 unit blocks in inner-city locations across
Australia and has been selling since last year.
