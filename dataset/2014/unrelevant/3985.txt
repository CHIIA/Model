(59.0) Junoob 2000m R'wick Hill Stakes Sept 20. Came from last in a small field to score sht hd win

when 4 len 7th (57.0) Fawkner 2000m Caulfield Stks Oct 11. Disappointed last time but she was placed

len 8th (54.0) The Cleaner 2040m M Valley JRA Cup dead trk Sept 26. Always handy before scoring lg
nk win (53.0) Signoff, Let's Make Adeal 2400m C'field Herbert Power Oct 11. Talented stayer who has
