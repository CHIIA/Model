Markets - Retailer's lucrative IPO

Shares in lighting retailer Beacon Lighting Group surged on Tuesday's listing, in what is shaping to be
one of the most lucrative among the initial public offers of the past 12 months.

The stock started trading at $1.06, nearly double the offer price of 66¢. Despite fluctuating in early trade
the shares quickly settled and closed at $1.06. More than a quarter of the shares available for trade
changed hands in their first session after making their debut higher than the target prices most investors
in the IPO had set for the first 12 months.

"We were surprised. the stock had already pushed through our valuation at debut but we still plan to
hold it because we are happy with the long term outlook for the business," BT Investment Management
smaller companies fund portfolio manager Noel Webster said.

Other participating institutions, included Wilson Asset Management, Perpetual and Paradice Investment
Management. None were allocated the full portion of shares they requested.
The team at lead broker Morgans closed the subscription for the initial public offering in early March
having raised $63.855 million through the allocation of 96.75 million shares priced at 66¢ each. The
deal valued the company at $142 million. By Tuesday's close, Beacon had a market capitalisation of
$227.9 million.

The light fixtures retailer did not raise any new capital through the float, which was a vehicle for Martin
Hanman, an electrician who has been a silent partner since 1997, to cash out his 45 per cent stake in
the chain that then comprised 13 stores.

Such a rapid appreciation in value raises the question of whether the brokers left too much value on the
table. Mr Hanman declined to comment and it is not known how much he paid for his stake originally,
however, according to Beacon's chief executive Glen Robinson, Mr Hanman remains "more than
happy" with the pricing of the deal.

Chief executive of stockbroking and financial planning group Austock, Bill Bessemer, was employed in a
private capacity as lead corporate adviser on the deal.

Beacon Lighting Group now owns 71 stores and the brand has another 14 stores run as franchises. The
company plans to open six more fully owned stores in each year of the next five years. The company
sources 90 per cent of its product directly rather than going through wholesalers. More than 80 per cent
of stock is manufactured offshore, mostly in China, under the Beacon brand. The business has an
average gross sales margin of 64 per cent.

Almost 2 per cent of revenue is earned from online sales and the board has set a target of website
sales of 5 per cent to 6 per cent within three years.

Europe, with a long-term strategy to grow the wholesale export business.
Pro forma sales revenue is expected to reach $150.26 million for the current financial year, while net
profit is estimated at $11.46 million. Beacon has forecast earnings per share of 5.3¢ in fiscal 2014 and
plans to pay a dividend of 1.4¢ a share fully franked.

Executive chairman Ian Robinson started as an employee in 1969 and by 1975 had bought the
business. His family remains in control through its 55 per cent holding.
