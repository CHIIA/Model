A revamped deal between the NBN Co, Telstra and Optus covering the rollout of the government's
hybrid broadband network is a milepost in a long journey, but an important one.

Cabinet was set to consider the new deal on Tuesday. Telstra's board and Optus's parent, Singtel,
were in the wings, ready to approve it once cabinet agreed. Announcements are expected as soon as
Sunday, and contracts as thick as old Telstra telephone directories should be signed before Christmas.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will take months more to review the contacts,
but agreement on co-operation and terms is a breakthrough.

As part of the deal, NBN Co will acquire the hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) cable networks that Telstra and
Optus rolled out in the mid-90s with their pay TV offers. It will upgrade and merge them, fill gaps in
their coverage, and use the HFC to accelerate its broadband rollout.

The government's hybrid broadband plan replaces Labor's national fibre to the home network, and
patches together fibre to the home, fibre to the neighbourhood node and the Telstra and Optus cable.

It is significantly different architecture to Labor's but Telstra's demand that it be "kept whole" on its
original $11.2 billion deal with Labor and the NBN Co is going to be met, and then some.
Telstra's original deal was valued at $11.2 billion on a net present value basis that discounted
payments that were to flow over decades. Actual payments over 55 years were estimated at $98
billion. The new deal should lock that value in and add to it, because Telstra will also be paid as an
adviser to the rollout and construction overseer.

The government for its part can seize on the announcement that a deal has been struck to argue that it
is making things happen. Its next big challenge however is to demonstrate that its revised rollout is on
budget.
The hybrid fibre network was costed at a maximum of $41 billion a year ago, but in its 2014-2017
corporate plan last month, NBN Co said there were too many unknowns including the incomplete
negotiations with Telstra and Optus for it to make forecasts for the final two years of the plan "with a
reasonable level of confidence".

With the Telstra and Optus negotiations finalised, it remains on course for what Communications
Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann say will be a more detailed
corporate plan next year, covering 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Whether they arrive then or earlier, more complete projections are certainly going to be interesting.

One question is whether the hybrid project's revenue trajectory will hold up despite its exclusion of
higher-speed, higher-price services that were to be available on Labor's fibre to the home network. The
very early takeup of the fastest, highest price option on Labor's NBN was 23 per cent.

Another slide in the oil price sent the sharemarket into another nosedive yesterday, but the case
remains that a lower oil price creates winners as well as losers.
As I mentioned last week, oil's 40 per cent price plunge since the middle of this year does create risks,
for those who sell oil and those who finance them.
Oil company earnings are tumbling, and companies that have heavy debt loads including ones
operating in the US shale oil sector are exposed. Oil producing countries with weak balance sheets
are, too. Russia is the standout there.
After analysing what it says is basically a transfer of income from oil exporting countries to oil
importing countries, BNP Paribas finds more national winners than losers, however.
A fall in the oil price of $US10 a barrel should boost US GDP by about 0.3 per cent, it says. The same
price decline could boost the Eurozone's GDP by about 0.4 per cent, although the European Central
Bank might still ease monetary policy as it struggles to fend off deflation.

Australia's GDP should rise by about 0.1 per cent as a result of a $10 a barrel price drop, BNP says. It
also says that a $10 price drop should deliver an across-the-board growth boost to Australia's most
important trading region, Asia, including a growth boost of 0.2 per cent for China.
There are losers, of course. A $10 a barrel cut costs Russia 0.5 per cent of GDP on BNP's oil price
ready reckoner, and costs Canada and Norway 0.2 per cent of GDP. Most of the world is on the right
side of BNP's long-term oil price slide ledger however. That's something worth keeping in mind as the
markets whipsaw.
