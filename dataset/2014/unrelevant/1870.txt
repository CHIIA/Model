0542 GMT [Dow Jones] Signs of a rebalancing of growth in Australia's economy are being overwhelmed
by drops in company and government investment, said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS. The
additional burden of sharply falling commodity prices is also undermining the economy's earnings.
Haslem adds that late 2015 may yet prove to be too early for the central bank to step away from the
current record low record low cash rate. "While we continue to see as low the likelihood they'll trim the
cash rate further, some stabilisation in the global economy and an ongoing fall in the Australian dollar is
now likely needed to sustain that view," Haslem said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0535 GMT [Dow Jones] With Australia's terms of trade falling sharply, the risks are skewed to the
downside for the economy, says Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital Markets. If more
assistance is not delivered by a further fall in the value of the Australian dollar in the months ahead, there
is a high chance that the central bank will respond with another rate cut early next year, he says.

0532 GMT [Dow Jones] India's state-run telecommunications companyMahanagar Telephone Nigam
(500108.BY) plans to raise 37.69 billion rupees ($609 million) by issuing bonds, as it aims to repay
high interest loans. Earnings of MTNL, which operates in two of India's 22 telecom service areas, has
been hurt by high finance costs which makes up more than half of its revenue. During the
July-September quarter, the company said it posted a loss of 8.34 billion rupees on revenue of 8.51
billion rupees. Its finance costs for the quarter stood at 4.25 billion rupees. (krishna.jai@wsj.com;

0516 GMT [Dow Jones] Malaysia risks running the so-called twin-deficit, or a shortfall in both fiscal and
current accounts, by the first quarter of 2015 if exports remain weak, AllianceDBS says. "As the fiscal
deficit is not expected to return to a balance before 2020, the twin deficit situation, even temporarily, put
the country's sovereign credit rating at risk of a downgrade," AllianceDBS says. Malaysia expects fiscal
deficit at 3.0% of gross domestic product next year, down from estimated 3.5% of GDP this year. The
house trims Malaysia's 2015 economic growth forecast to 5.0% on expectation of softening consumption
and export growth; a worst-case scenario puts Malaysia's growth at 3%-4%, resulting in the government
missing its fiscal target and risking a rating downgrade. Alliance expects the USD/MYR to be within
3.30-3.35 for full-year 2015, though it could hit a high of 3.50 next year. (jason.ng@wsj.com; Twitter:

0511 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/USD has been dragged lower as the AUD/USD falls on
worse-than-expected third-quarter gross domestic product data, says Western Union Business Solutions
corporate dealing manager Chris Hunter. "Things are not looking so sharp for commodity currencies." He
adds that the NZD/USD had already been under pressure following further falls in the GlobalDairyTrade
auction. The pair is at 0.7789. Hunter puts support for the pair at 0.7710 with resistance at 0.7825.

0454 GMT [Dow Jones] While the USD/JPY continues to show its strength (now at 119.23 after hitting a
fresh 7-year high of 119.44), Daiwa Securities chief FX analyst Yuji Kameoka warns that lower crude oil
prices could end up weakening expectations for both U.S. interest rates and the USD going higher.
Some U.S. monetary policy officials have said lower oil prices bode well for U.S. consumption and
growth. But Kameoka warns that a sufficiently large falloff in energy-related shares could spark a retreat
in U.S. stocks, causing a negative wealth effect in the area of personal consumption. "If people become
aware that excessive dollar strength, combined with oil price weakness, could cut into economic growth
in addition to putting downward pressure on inflation, market expectations for an early rate hike will likely
recede," Kameoka says. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

0339 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's electronics production could fall more in December after some
orders ahead of the Christmas-New Year festive season provided a temporary spurt, DBS Bank says in a
note after Singapore released softer November PMI readings. Singapore's overall manufacturing
purchasing managers' index eases to 51.8 in November from 51.9 in October while electronics PMI falls
sharply to 50.6 in November from 52.5 in October, according to late night data from the Singapore
Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management. The earlier uptick in the electronics PMI was boosted
mainly by a surge in the finished goods index, DBS says. "Risk is that production in the electronics
cluster may ease further in December. It appears that manufacturers may be in for a quiet Christmas," it
says. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)

0327 GMT [Dow Jones] The Indian government plans to auction frequencies to cellphone companies in
February next year, according to a note on the telecom regulator's website. The upcoming sale is crucial
for cellphone companies as well as the government. India's government aims to raise 454.71 billion
rupees through the sale, to narrow its fiscal deficit. (krishna.jai@wsj.com; Twitter: @jaikrishna)

0323 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's overall manufacturing and electronics purchasing managers' index
readings decline in November, signaling the competitive export environment in Asia. The overall
manufacturing PMI eases to 51.8 in November from 51.9 in October, according to the Singapore Institute
of Purchasing & Materials Management. Electronics PMI falls sharply to 50.6 in November from 52.5 in
October, according to the institute. Singapore's exports and manufacturing have been subdued this year
as demand from its key markets in Europe and from within Asia remains weak amid continued sluggish
economic growth. The data point to a softer fourth quarter gross domestic product, which the government
expects to grow by 3.0% in 2014. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)

0319 GMT [Dow Jones] The yuan falls as China's central bank guides it weaker via a daily reference
rate, despite data shows modest economic resilience outside the country's factory sector. The yuan is at

Tuesday. "The yuan is trending lower theses days and a weaker yuan fixing just gave it another push,"
says a Shanghai-based foreign bank trader. The HSBC China services purchasing managers index rose
to 53.0 from 52.9 in October while China's official non-manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to
53.9 in November from 53.8 in October. Offshore, one-year USD/CNY non-deliverable forwards are up at
6.2670/6.2720 from 6.2620/6.2640 late Tuesday. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0315 GMT [Dow Jones] The HSBCHong Kong purchasing managers' index rose slightly to 48.8 in
November from 47.7 in October but remained in contraction mode (below 50) due to the fall of output and
new orders as well as sharp decline of new business from China. HSBC says Hong Kong private sector
companies signalled a further deterioration in overall operating conditions in November, with a number of
firms citing subdued market conditions that in many cases were linked to the ongoing political protest.
"Hong Kong's economy is still weakening," HSBC economist John Zhu says. "Given the weakness in
demand from mainland China, the risks to growth remain on the downside," he adds.

0303 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/TWD rises, tracking the stronger USD/JPY, says a local trader. "We
are basically following the USD/JPY, which will likely hit 120.00 soon," the trader says, and adds
exporters are turning cautious in selling [the USD] as they expect the USD will rise further. The pair is at
31.118, higher than 31.050 traded before the local central bank's suspected intervention Tuesday, which
lifted it to 31.106 at the close of the onshore trading session, traders say. Taiwan government bonds are
lower, reflecting overnight declines in U.S. Treasurys. A trader says the yield of the U.S. 10-year bond
hitting 2.300% dampened local bond investor confidence and triggered some stop-loss selling. The
most-traded 10-year bond yield rises to 1.6040% from 1.5890% late Tuesday; the five-year bond yield is
at 1.1235% versus 1.0950%. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)
