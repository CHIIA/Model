0306 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is down 0.4% at 5430.8 after having fallen as low as
5423 after data showed unemployment held steady at 5.8% in May for a third straight month. "We have a
mixed bag today," CMC Markets Stockbroking equities dealer Chay Flak says. Media stocks are back in
the spotlight on speculation over government changes to industry regulations while Ramsay Health Care
(RHC.AU) shares have risen after brokers reacted largely positively to an acquisition, he says. Falling
iron-ore prices, meanwhile, have reignited worries about Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.AU) debt.

0303 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is down 0.8% at 14,952.77 midday, as the dollar regains the Y102
level (now Y102.09). Futures and options trade continues to be brisk, with special quotations (SQ) for
June settlement coming up tomorrow. The most active call options are at the 15000 strike price, while the
most traded puts are at 14750. But overall cash market volume remains somewhat tepid at under 1.1
billion shares. "Order flows from foreign players remain light, as the 15,000 mark is seen as about the
upper limit for the current market," says an equity trading director at a European brokerage. "If (Prime
Minister) Abe disappoints with his economic policy speech--especially in his target for corporate tax
cuts--there could be a further selloff. If the PM's presentation is next week, which is likely, event-driven
hedge funds will have their plates full." (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)
0302 GMT [Dow Jones] A slump in the shares of China's transportation service provider Shanghai Haibo
(600708.SH) shows that "investors are voting with their feet," says Jack Zhang, an investment adviser
with BOC International (China). Shanghai Haibo announced Thursday in filings to the exchange that its
parent companyBright Food plans to inject 8 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) worth of property development
assets into the listed firm. Exchange filings show that the NGS Real Estate Group, the unit of Bright
Food that is part of the Haibo deal in an asset and cash swap, posted declines in its net profits over the
past two consecutive years. Zhang adds that "investors remain bearish on property market outlook."

0249 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/MYR is inching higher after nullifying its bearish technical bias on
Wednesday's close above the ceiling of the daily Bollinger downtrend channel. The U.S. dollar may
however find technical resistance at 3.2160 - the 20-day Bollinger mid line - and stall there. If this barrier
is breached at Thursday's close, more gains could be in store for the greenback. The U.S. dollar is rising
against most Asian currencies as risk aversion emerges in regional stock markets. USD/MYR is now
3.2140 from its Wednesday close of 3.2100. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0245 GMT [Dow Jones] South Korea widens its liquefied natural gas import possibilities, thanks to
Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd.'s (028050.SE) deal Thursday with mid-sized U.S. gas export project,
Texas LNG. The agreement, which also gives the Samsung Group unit an equity stake in the project, is
to complete design work within a year for the Texas LNG export facility, which has also just received
government authorization to ship abroad 2 million tons a year of U.S. gas, with deliveries expected from
2018. Samsung's "relationship with major Korean LNG offtakers and financial institutions is also a big

Page146of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.plus, especially since Korea is the second largest consumer of LNG in the world," says Langtry Meyer,
COO of Texas LNG. (simon.hall@wsj.com)

0243 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan enters a "reign of error" as Abenomics will not only fail to get the economy
back to growth but will increase risk that may eventually precipitate a financial crisis, Lombard Street
Research says. "These policies ignore the chief structural defect of the Japanese economy--seriously
insufficient consumer spending caused by an excessive flow of income dammed up in the business
sector," Lombard Street Research chief economist and Chairman Charles Dumas says. "Abenomics has
produced only a temporary growth spurt and has worsened already-weak household incomes." Japan
may return to deflation without a currency devaluation but a lower yen will lead to higher interest rates
putting an increasing burden on the national debt. "A major financial crisis in [three to five years] is a
serious risk...not some remote possibility." (jacky.wong@wsj.com; Twitter: @jackycwong)

0239 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's unemployment rate of 5.8% continues to significantly understate the
weakness in the job market seen in recent years, says Shane Oliver, head of research at AMP Capital.
He says that if the job market participation rate had remained at its 2011 average level, the
unemployment rate would now be 7%. Mr. Oliver also pointed to the labor force underutilization rate
which takes account of unemployed and underemployed workers, saying it remains very high at 13.5%.
Still, recent forward looking indicators of hiring intention and job advertising suggest there could be better
days ahead, he added. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

0238 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/SGD pair slipped this morning as low as 1.2491 from 1.2499 in late
New York trade Wednesday as buying on the SGD/JPY cross and buoyant Singapore shares boosted
the SGD. The SGD/JPY cross was last at 81.68, up from 81.58 late Wednesday, while the Straits Times
Index was recently up 0.1% at 3292. Dow Jones technical analysis shows further downside in USD/SGD
may encounter support at 1.2475 and then at 1.2450. Spot USD/SGD was recently quoted at 1.2493-98
in the interbank market. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0236 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY will likely bounce back later in June in tandem with gains in U.S.
interest rates, says Yunosuke Ikeda, chief FX strategist at Nomura Securities. Unexpected falls in U.S.
Treasury yields and receding hope for BOJ monetary easing help decelerate the pace of gain in the
USD/JPY, but "it is just a matter of time before the USD/JPY will increase," says Mr. Ikeda. He tips the
pair to likely advance to 104 at the end of June from its current 102.01 partly on hopes for a $1.2-trillion
Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF). Japan's GPIF is the largest public pension fund in the
world. General expectations are high that the GPIF will take a more aggressive approach to investment.
A shift in the GPIF's assets towards more foreign assets could help support a higher USD/JPY.

0232 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares slip slightly Thursday morning, amid a lack of further reform news
from policymakers. The Shanghai Composite is last down 0.1% to 2051.97. "There's nothing in the way
of fresh economic data or comments from Beijing, so the index is just wavering," says Tang Yonggang,
analyst with Hongyuan Securities. "It's still the consumer names that are being favored." Among the
gainers were aerospace manufacturers--XiAn Aero-Engine PLC (600893.SH) is up 5.0% to CNY22.89,
Shaanxi Aero-space Power Hi-Tech Co. Ltd. (600343.SH) gains 1.8% to CNY10.36 and China Spacesat
Co. Ltd. (60018.SH) is 0.8% higher to CNY17.47. The Shenzhen Index slips 0.2% to 1066.39.

0227 GMT [Dow Jones] It's all running pretty much to plan in Australia, says Craig James, chief
economist at CommSec. When economic activity picks up, employers tend to work existing staff more
intensively and perhaps take on more casual staff, Mr. James says. And when businesses assume that
the pick-up in orders and production will be sustained, they will take on full-time staff and attempt to
convert part-time staff to full-time employees. He notes that more than 100,000 full-time jobs have been
created in 2014--the best start to a year in seven years. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

0215 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's unemployment rate remained steady at 5.8% in May for a third month
in a row. Weak employment growth through that three month period was offset by a fall in the number of
people seeking work. The silver lining in the May data came in the form a strong 22,200 rise in full-time
employment. This was offset by a 27,000 fall in part-time job creation. Overall the data offers few clues to
the outlook for interest rates, although the apparent stabilization in the unemployment rate is a better
outcome to the steady increases seen last year. (james.glynn@wsj.com)
