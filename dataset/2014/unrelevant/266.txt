Our market is down at midday perhaps following a disappointing balance of trade number, while earnings
reports so far are mixed. The RBA is not likely to change the current interest rate of 2.5% when it makes
its announcement this afternoon, according to consensus.
Meanwhile, China's decision to ban the use of coal in the Beijing precinct is not good news for Aussie
coal stocks.

"High will be 5561. Low will be 5530. Close at 5544, up 3.1 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract pointing up 4 points. US equities managed to close higher overnight,
although the volume on the move suggests it is just a bounce, rather than the initiation of a new rally.

"Widening credit spreads and the under performance of the banks and small cap stocks in the US, are
indicative of tightening liquidity, which by extension, implies further downside for equities in due course.

"But none of this matters for today. The high will be 5561. The low will be 5530. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5544, up 3.1 points'.

THE S&P/ASX200 CLOSED DOWN 15.5 POINTS TO 5540.9 POINTS LAST EVENING.

The Perth Mint's sales of gold and silver dropped to a three-month low in July, as increasing optimism
about global economic growth curbed appetite for the
precious metal. The Perth Mint runs the only gold refinery in Australia, the
world's second-biggest gold producer after China. Sales of gold coins and minted bars nearly halved to
25,103 ounces in July from the same period a year ago, data available on the mint's website showed.
Silver sales totalled 577,988 ounces last month. Gold and silver sales in July were the lowest since April.
China to ban coal use in six main districts by end 2020 - Xinhua
"The Age" reported quoting China's official news agency Xinhua, Beijing will ban coal use in its six main
districts by the end of 2020, state media cited the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau as
saying, as the Chinese capital steps up efforts to combat air pollution.
Beijing and the surrounding area in China's northeast is often wreathed in noxious smog, which has been
cited as a factor in high rates of lung cancer.
Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai and Shijingshan districts will all stop using coal and
coal products and shut down coal-fired power plants and other coal facilities, the official Xinhua news
agency said on Monday.
In 2012, coal made up one-quarter of the city's total energy consumption, Xinhua quoted official statistics
as saying.
Fuel oil, petroleum coke, combustible waste and some biomass fuels will also be prohibited as part of the
effort to fight pollution, Xinhua said.

on women in rural communities.

Both parties acknowledged the key role played by the International Finance Corporation in facilitating the
agreement and looked forward to working with the IFC in facilitating the agreement.

September 2013 it has attracted 17,000 new customers, including 10,000 who had never previously held

a range of new products to the market and drive growth.

"While it is still early in the product release cycle, record sales in the second half gives us confidence as
we go into fiscal 2015".

Analysts expectations: $105 mln/104.2 mln/$98.8 mln, div 127c/$97 mln.

*A leading broker with a "neutral" recommendation on July 28 said investors will be focused on the take
up of recent new product launches, i.e. the N6 processor (US and Europe), the Aqua+ accessory and the
re-launched N5 (Europe only) implant. The broker's price target is $62.

*Two brokers had "lighten" and "underweight" recommendations on July 20 and July 31 respectively.

One broker with a price target of $56.72, up from $55.76, said, "Despite impressive cost control, margin is
ultimately unsustainable considering the increasingly competitive environment".

The other broker with an "underweight" recommendation on July 31 had a price target of $44.68. the
broker said results point towards faster market C1 growth for 2014, with growth in bi-laterals likely to be
the driver of this gain. "For COH to meet guidance requires significant market share restoration.
Meanwhile, Advanced Bionics reported 50.2% revenue growth in six months to March 31 2014 on market
share gains'.

*DOW: NPAT flat, 12c ff div/lower profit f/cast in 2015/longer term positive

part franked final last year. The DRP has been suspended.

Diluted eps is 46c vs 43.1c last year.

NTA backing per security is 315.2c vs 289.5c last year.

Guidance

Downer EDI Ltd announced in its outlook statement that while the forward outlook varies by market, with
government related expenditure on capital andservices looking promising while resource based
expenditure is expected to be flat, or declining from the current low levels, "forthe 2015 financial year,
Downer is targeting NPAT of around $205 million".
However while mining commodity markets are currently very difficult for a number of Downer's major
customers with a short term impact on service providers like Downer being hard to predict, longer term
this pressure will drive increased demand for Downer's services as companies look for more efficient
service delivery.

Analysts expectations: $214.8 mln/$213.5 mln, div 11c/$220.9 mln.

*On July 25 a leading broker retained an "add" on Downer EDI, expecting it to beat on P&, operating cash
flow, net cash and likely full year 2015 guidance (where consensus is going backwards). A good result is
starting to be factored into the price, but the share price could run further as it is trading at a discount to
peers'.

*TCL: Prop EBITDA up 12.8%, distrib pre announced/outlook positive

cash covered.
CEO Scott Charlton said in the report the 2014 financial year was a very active period for the group. It
made headway in network enhancing projects and expanded its footprint in Australia through the
acquisition of Queensland Motorways and Sydney's Cross City Tunnel, but the core focus was efficient
operation of its existing networks.

Analysts expectations: Neg $400,000, div 18c/$140.8 mln/$214.8 mln
*A leading broker on August 1 had a "neutral" recommendation for Transurban Group with a price target
of $7.52.

*One leading broker with an "add" recommendation and a price target of $7.97, up from $7.29 said "TCL
remains our top pick in the transport infrastructure space given its unparalleled suite of assets and strong
growth prospects. Trading at 18.8x full year 2015 EV/EBITDA with a 5.1% yield and 9% DPS growth p.a.
over the next three years we maintain our Add rating on an increased $7.97 target price".
*Another leading broker with a "buy" recommendation and a $8.40 target price said it expects a first year
proportionate EBITDA contribution from NorthConnex of around $42 million in 2020 which grows to $58
million in full year 2125 and at around 6% p.a. thereafter.

The broker reduced its traffic growth assumptions on the Westlink M7 from 2018 onwards reflecting a
slowdown in demand from heavy traffic due to the impact of the truck toll multiplier.

The broker (which has a Nil net earnings report for 2014) said it continues to view the stock's 10% p.a.
average 5 year distribution growth and near term catalysts as attractive. It retained a "buy"
recommendation and $8.40 price target.
