The market declined as three of Australia's biggest banks dipped after trading ex-dividend.

But the losses were stemmed as the biggest bank, Commonwealth Bank, hit a record high after
showing another bumper profit.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index inched down just 1.7 points, or 0.03 per cent, on Wednesday to 5496.5. The
All Ordinaries Index outperformed its large-cap counterpart as it managed a 0.5-point, or 0.01 per
cent, gain to 5475.9, with strategists relieved the federal budget was less austere than feared and
smaller companies set to benefit most from a 1.5 per cent cut to the company tax rate.
The market lifted briefly at the start of trade off a positive lead from the US after the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the S&P 500 eked out record highs on Tuesday.
Ten-year government bonds edged up 0.04 per cent and the dollar jumped above US94¢.

"As an international investor it is very encouraging to see the Australian government show a
responsible attitude towards narrowing the debt-to-GDP ratio. While it could have a mildly dampening
effect on the local equity market, Tuesday's budget will be well received by the global bond market,"
Fidelity Worldwide Investments global chief investment officer fixed income and real estate Andrew
Wells said.

"It was a bit disappointing to see growth targets below 3 per cent over the next couple of years, but
the medium term target of 3 per cent looks good."

Ratings agency Moody's reaffirmed Australia's AAA investment rating.

BHP Billiton lifted 0.9 per cent to $38.30 as it took the first big step in its plan to separate non-core
assets by registering its aluminium division as a new company. Rio Tinto dipped 0.1 per cent to
$62.78. The spot price for iron ore, landed in China, lifted 0.3 per cent to $US103 a tonne.

CBA climbed 1.2 per cent to a record close of $80.89 after a jump in third-quarter cash profit of $2.2
billion.

ANZ added 0.8 per cent to $33.15. Westpac lost 94¢ to $34.20 as it traded without the rights to a 90¢
interim dividend. National Australia Bank shed 90¢ to $33.60 as it traded without the rights to a 99¢
interim dividend. The combined losses of the two shares shaved about 20 points off the benchmark
index. Investment bank Macquarie Group fell 84¢ to $59.16 as it traded without the rights to a $1.60
final dividend.
