The boss of the world’s second-largest winemaker, which is the target of a £1.9 billion bid battle, struck
a bullish tone on the company’s future despite revealing a bigger-than-expected A$101 million (£56.5
million) loss.
Australia’s TreasuryWine Estates, the subject of a takeover battle between private equity firms KKR and
TPG Capital, revealed the loss at its full-year results and said operating earnings had fallen 32%, hit by
currency fluctuations.

But former Kraft executive Michael Clarke, who took over running the business in March, was adamant
the group is in recovery as it slashes costs and jobs. He said: “The fundamentals which make our
business attractive have not changed. Importantly, the change required to enable the company to
realise the true value of its brands, assets and people has begun.”

The maker of Lindemans, Rosemount and Wolf Blass wines suffered competition in its home market
from New Zealand imports and rival wines from South America, while a Chinese crackdown on
ostentatious gift-giving as part of an anti-corruption drive has also hit sales. It had to destroy thousands
of gallons of “old and obsolete wine” in the US that had passed its drink-by date, and wrote off A$281
million.
The group did not comment on the takeover offers it has received. But Clarke said it will now focus on
more upmarket wines and will target Asia and the US. He added: “Our Americas business represents a
key growth platform. The luxury category in the US is the fastest growing and to date, Our participation
has been limited due to supply constraints.”
