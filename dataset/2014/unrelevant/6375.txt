Atlas Iron maintained the slimmest of cash margins in the September quarter, booking a leeway on
cash operating costs of less than $2 a tonne despite slashing costs by 8 per cent at its Pilbara mines.
Regarded by many as the most vulnerable WA producer to plunging iron ore prices, Atlas cut its all-in
cash costs — which includes production, royalties, administration and freight costs, but not interest
expenses or capital spending — to $68.90 for each wet metric tonne delivered to China. It received an
average of $70.83/t through the quarter, leaving cash margins of $1.93/t, or in aggregate $5.97
million, for the 3.1 million tonnes shipped.

After spending $67 million on development projects — and despite receiving $18 million after
environmental bonds were freed up by the State Government’s mining rehabilitation fund reforms —
Atlas’ cash position fell $60 million in the three months to September 30.
Atlas’ cash pile has fallen from $461 million in July last year to $205 million at September 30.
It owes a $US270 million term loan and $14 million through other facilities, and has flagged interest
payments of about $28 million this financial year.

Managing director Ken Brinsden said yesterday Atlas was not concerned about the fall in its cash
position, given the money was being spent on construction of expansion projects.

“It was always going to be the case, particularly in the current pricing environment, that we would
continue to draw down our net debt position because there was continued investment going on,” he
said.

“However, it in essence has peaked. We might marginally increase the net debt position in the current
quarter but we don’t expect it to go much further.

“It’s not a serious or significant impost. Yes, we have continued to go a little bit more net debt but
we’re not concerned about the relative position of cash to net debt. The debt was there for that
purpose, to continue to invest in our mines.”

Mr Brinsden said Atlas expected to make further cuts to operating costs over the rest of this year, and
the company had cut or deferred more than $30 million from its capital expenditure budget, down to
$94 million. Atlas shares closed steady at 36¢.
Tight squeeze $1.93/t Atlas Iron’s cash operating margin, on a tonne of iron ore shipped to China,
last quarter.
