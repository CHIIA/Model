0551 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian property research firm RP Data Research says it expects to report
capital city house prices showing growth of around 1.6% in July from June. With final data due out on
Friday, the firms issued a preliminary estimate Wednesday. The growth is being driven by the Sydney
and Melbourne markets, which have continued to outperform the smaller state capitals, it said. "The
strong growth conditions have been supported by high clearance rates and a slowdown in the number of
homes being advertised for sale. Consumer confidence has also ticked up over the month which is likely
to provide further market support," it added. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0537 GMT [Dow Jones] South Korea's benchmark stock index jumped July 30 by as much as 1.1% to its
highest in 3 years. One factor is the government's $40 billion economic stimulus plan, announced July
24. In addition to unleashing 11.7 trillion won ($11.3 billion) in government funds on the economy, the
plan envisions a tax on companies accumulating cash reserves. That could force them to disgorge some
of the roughly 97.9 trillion won in cash they have on their balance sheets to investors as dividends.
Topping the list of cash cows is Samsung Electronics, which pay a 1% dividend yield despite having 16.3
trillion won in cash. (wayne.arnold@wsj.com)
0510 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds rebound from earlier losses after a new 30-year bond
auction, two local traders say. The government sells all of NT$35 billion in 30-year bonds on offer, with
the cut-off yield at 2.300%. Some market participants were concerned the government wouldn't be able to
sell all the 30-year bonds as local insurers had already bid actively in a 20-year bond auction on Monday,
traders say. "We saw some short-squeeze buying after the outcome of the auction," a trader says. The
most-traded five-year bond yield falls to 1.1748%, off its earlier high 1.1985%, vs.1.1800% late Tuesday;
traders tip the yield to find a near-term floor at 1.1700%. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0505 GMT [Dow Jones] Industrial production in Thailand continued to fall in June owing to declines in
motor-vehicles, hard-disks, electrical appliances and textiles, the Office of Industrial Economics says. The
Manufacturing Production Index drops 6.6% year over year compared with a revised 4% contraction in
May. It is the 15th consecutive monthly decline and is much larger than a consensus forecast for a 3.3%
contraction. Slowing in domestic demand and spending, particularly on motor vehicles and electrical
appliances, is responsible, the OIE says. (nopparat.chaichalearmmongkol@dowjones.com)

0500 GMT [Dow Jones] Genworth Mortgage Insurance (GMA.AU) shares rise to a record A$3.56 after
underlying first-half net profit after tax rose 41% to A$133.1 million thanks to higher premiums and fewer
claims owing to a strong property market. Gross written premium rose 15% to A$313.6 million and the
company forecast a full-year profit of A$231 million-A$250 million. "The good result from Genworth is
quite important for market sentiment because it's the first of the recent IPO's to report and they have
beaten prospectus forecasts," Macquarie Private Wealth investment adviser John Milroy says.

0450 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar is softer against its New Zealand counterpart
Wednesday--retreating from a seven-and-a-half month high of 1.1047 hit Tuesday--as sentiment for the

Page18of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.kiwi receives a boost after Statistics New Zealand says seasonally adjusted new dwellings consented
rose 3.5% in June. However, Dow Jones technical analysis shows the Aussie/kiwi's technical outlook is
still positive: the five- and 15-day moving averages are advancing; the daily MACD indicator is bullish; the
daily slow stochastic measure is staying elevated at the overbought level; the rate-of-change momentum
indicator is advancing inside positive territory. That suggest dips in spot AUD/NZD would be opportunities
to accumulate longs for a near-term rise to 1.1162--the previous base set on Sept. 23. Support is
expected at 1.0958--the Monday low. Spot AUD/NZD was last at 1.1018 versus 1.1030 in late New York
trade Tuesday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0432 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse cuts Elan Microelectronic Corp.'s (2458.TW) target price to
NT$65.00 from NT$72.00 after lowering the company's 2014 EPS by 4% to reflect the panel maker's
conservative 2H14 outlook, but it keeps 2015-16 EPS largely unchanged. The house recommends
investors buy on weakness as new projects for touch screen chipsets, notebook touchpads and
fingerprint sensors will support the company's growth in 2015. It maintains an outperform rating on the
stock, which was last trading up 1.6% at NT$50.10. (lorraine.luk@wsj.com Twitter @LorraineLuk)

0432 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/INR may break out of its week-long consolidation if it ends the day above
60.20 and enters the daily Bollinger uptrend channel. The trigger for a U.S.-dollar rally may be
Wednesday's U.S. second-quarter GDP data--forecast to rise 3.0% from a previous decline of 2.9%. The
U.S. FOMC interest-rate decision later isn't expected to surprise. As the U.S. increases pressure on
Russia with new sanctions and Middle East turmoil continues rupee traders are watching crude-oil prices.
Because of India's reliance on imported oil its economy is at the mercy of oil prices. USD/INR is now
60.18 from its Monday close of 60.08. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)
0429 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities are on track for a seventh straight day of gains as banks
see revenues soaring at the city's property developers. The Hang Seng Index is up 0.8% at 24,825.69,
while H-shares lag; the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index increases 0.4% to 11,164.31. The properties
sub-index leads gains, up 2.3% as Wharf Holdings (0004.HK) jumps 3.2% to HK$62.65 and shares in
Cheung Kong Holdings (0001.HK) rise 2% to HK$150.10. BNP Paribas lifts its target price on Cheung
Kong by 5% to HK$163, saying the company will report the strongest revenues among Hong Kong
developers when it reports Q2 earnings tomorrow. "Strong sales were driven by successful new launches
and the disposal of a commercial site in Wong Chuk Hang for HK$3.2b," BNP says.

0410 GMT [Dow Jones] The risk-sensitive Australian dollar is trading in subdued fashion against the yen
Wednesday even as Tokyo stocks post modest gains. The Aussie/yen cross has been between 95.63
and 95.90 since Tuesday on caution ahead of U.S. advance second-quarter GDP and the Federal Open
Market Committee's interest-rate decision Wednesday. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the
Aussie/yen daily price chart is slightly positive-biased as the five-day moving average is above the 15-day
moving average and advancing; the daily MACD indicator is bullish; the rate-of-change momentum
indicator is advancing modestly inside positive territory; while the daily slow stochastic measure hovers
near the overbought level. A breach of the 95.90 resistance would target 96.17 (Thursday's high, near the
upper 20-day Bollinger Band), and then 96.50 (July 1 top). But a drop below the 95.63 support would
target 95.47 (Monday's low, near the middle 20-day Bollinger Band and the daily kijun line on the
AUD/JPY Ichimoku chart), and then the 55-day moving average (now at 95.29). Spot AUD/JPY was last
at 95.77, unchanged from its level in late New York Tuesday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0407 GMT [Dow Jones] Trade sanctions imposed on Russia are likely to be more of a regional issue and
only a modest restraint on international risk appetite, RBS strategist in Singapore Greg Gibbs says. The
still-easy international financial conditions are likely to keep investors concentrated on a search for yield
and this appears to have already helped boost Asia regional asset markets on a rotation out of Europe.
Gibbs continues see a trend towards a stronger U.S. dollar. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0401 GMT [Dow Jones] Thailand's industrial production is expected to contract in June on the back of
weak domestic demand and spending, economists forecast ahead of the data release Wednesday. The
consensus forecast is a 3.3% contraction, compared with a 4.1% reading in May. TISCO Economic
Strategy Unit says in a note that it expects June factory output contraction to ease to 3.5%
year-over-year, in line with an improvement in exports data of the month, which swung to growth for the
first time since February this year. (warangkana.chomchuen@wsj.com)
