Fortescue Metals Group will halve its spending on projects after taking the knife to its $US1.3 billion
($1.53 billion) capital budget for the 2015 financial year.

The Perth-based miner on Friday joined Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton in aggressively cutting capital,
with it now set to spend just $US650 million this financial year.

But in an attempt to distance Fortescue from the two major miners, which have defended export
expansions amid weak commodity prices, chief executive Nev Power said the cuts were made
because "in the current environment it is prudent to defer investing additional capital that increases
supply into the market".

The spending cut will see Fortescue's exploration budget savaged, and the deferral of a $US100
million detrital processing plant, which was expected to treat 5 million tonnes per year from mid
2015 onward.
The miner will also look for cheaper ways to complete the purchase of a group of very large ore
carriers, which are designed to lower freight costs to China.

In a statement to the ASX after the close of trading, Fortescue said alternative funding or ownership
models for the large vessels were being investigated.

Mr Power said the spending cuts would improve cashflow while maintaining export guidance for the
2015 financial year at between 155 million tonnes and 160 million tonnes.
"We will maximise output from our world-class mining and infrastructure assets and remain focused
on factors within our control to ensure the efficiency of operations and cash discipline to continue
the program of early, voluntary debt repayment," he said.

Fortescue said it would complete the construction of its fifth berth at Port Hedland but would look to
do so more efficiently.
Iron ore prices were fetching $US69.98 per tonne on Friday, less than half the price they were
fetching on December 9, 2013.
