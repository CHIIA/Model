And we're off! It is the Year of the Horse after all. Let's hope its Black Caviar not Zippy Chippy (Google it!).
Reporting season is now upon us and straight out of the barrier comes two nice ones. JB Hi-Fi Limited
(A$18.55, +3.1%) and Country Road Limited (A$4.83, unch) to get us under-way. Some news to cheer
about in the long suffering retail sector. Elsewhere the market flitted with a down 25 kind of day and even
popped its head up above the ramparts briefly, in positive territory before the ASX 200 slipped slightly in
quiet pre RBA trading.

For the record we closed down 2 at 5188 with a high of 5198 and a low of 5163.Banks showed some
strength with Westpac Banking Corporation (A$30.99, +0.4%), Commonwealth Bank of Australia
(A$74.40, +0.2%) and National Australia Bank Limited (A$33.19, -0.2%) outgunning Australia and New
Zealand Banking Group Limited (A$29.83, -1.0%) whilst in other financials they gave a little back with
Macquarie Group Limited (A$53.84, -0.5%),QBE Insurance Group Limited (A$11.38, -1.0%),Bank of
Queensland Limited (A$11.16, -2.1%) and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited (A$11.48, -1.0%) not so
good with Henderson Group PLC. (A$4.12, -2.4%) especially on the nose today. The big culprits today
were BHP Billiton Limited (A$36.44, -0.4%),RIO Tinto Limited (A$65.34, -0.5%) and Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd (A$5.27, -1.1%). But no real damage done. Just a flesh wound. In the industrial space
Woolworths Limited (A$33.93, -0.4%) eased back Wesfarmers Limited (A$42.19, +0.5%) little changed
,Telstra Corporation Limited (A$5.15, +0.2%) had a good day as did building stocks like Csr Limited
(A$2.96, +1.4%),Boral Limited (A$4.81, +1.3%),James Hardie Industries PLC (A$13.30, +3.1%),Adelaide
Brighton Limited (A$3.80, +0.5%) and Duluxgroup Limited (A$5.45, +1.9%). Others to do well included
Amcor Limited (A$10.83, +1.1%) and Bluescope Steel Limited (A$5.50, +1.9%) too. Resource stocks were
a little on the nose as the much maligned gold sector remained under pressure although Newcrest Mining
Limited (A$9.70, +0.5%) held up. Silver Lake Resources Limited (A$0.59, -3.3%), Kingsgate Consolidated
Limited (A$1.085, -3.6%),Evolution Mining Limited (A$0.615, -3.9%) all to the rails! Posting solid gains
today were Pacific Brands Limited (A$0.64, +4.1%),Southern Cross Media Group Limited (A$1.625,
+3.5%),#PBT#,Buru Energy Limited (A$1.88, +2.5%),Ten Network Holdings Limited (A$0.37, +4.2%) and
Slater & Gordon Limited (A$4.56, +3.6%) whilst sitting this one out were #XRO# (bout time),Lynas
Corporation Limited (A$0.275, -3.5%) (again)Treasury Wine Estates Limited (A$3.51, -3.6%)(still
hungover),Sirius Resources NL (A$2.11, -3.7%),Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited
(A$0.08, -4.8%) and Monadelphous Group Limited (A$15.51, -2.9%). With Chinese New Year closing
some markets it was up to Tokyo to take up the running. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.9 percent to
133.56 heading for the lowest close since Sept. 5. More than four shares fell for each that rose. The
measure dropped 4.6 percent in January for its third straight monthly decline. Japan heading for a two and
a half month low! Volume, at around $3.0bn, on our bourse was lacking with a slew of economic numbers
keeping players sidelined and the RBA to meet tomorrow.Aussie dollar around 87.54 and the price of
Bitcons around 1090 and Gold a smidge off at around $1244. Stocks and Stories JB Hi-Fi Limited
(A$18.55, +3.1%) is forecasting full-year net profit to rise as much as 10.8 per cent to $129 million for the
12 months ending June, underpinned by 6 to 8 per cent sales growth. Country Road Limited (A$4.83,
unch) Country Road has announced an interim profit result of $38 million, up 72 per cent from the first
half result last financial year. On an earnings per share basis the growth was 43 per cent, to 36.6 cents
per share. Another day, another PMI report from China as numbers released today on the
non-manufacturing sector showed that PMI falling to 53.4 in January from 54.6 in December. That's the
lowest reading since at least April 2011. TD Securities-Melbourne Institute's monthly measure of
consumer prices edged up 0.1 per cent in January from December, when it had jumped 0.7 per cent. The
annual pace slowed to 2.5 per cent, from 2.7 per cent, putting it bang in the middle of the Reserve Bank

may have been an aberration. Mortgage brokers are doing it tough at the moment! Not! Today AFG
announced that it had its strongest January on record, with more than $2.58 billion of home loans
processed last month, the company said. It was 14 per cent higher than last January. This should also
bode well for Mortgage Choice Limited (A$2.95, +1.4%). Seems all the growth is in investor loans though
with first time buyers staying well clear of the market for the moment. The future fund released its numbers
today and benefitted from its move into equities in the last year. The Fund has grown to $96.56 billion,
with a five-year return rate of 10.6 per cent per annum. It said today that its return for the year to
December was 17.2 per cent, against a benchmark target of 6.9 per cent. Just think how well it would
have gone had they not sold their Telstra Corporation Limited (A$5.15, +0.2%) at the bottom! Tomorrows
News Today RBA meeting tomorrow. Expecting no change to the current rate policy and maybe a bit of a
thought bubble on lower dollar and its implications for inflation. We can't have it both ways I am afraid.
Third bailout coming for Greece. And they keep telling us it's improving. So far exports of Hummus and
Taramosalata have been hit badly. They are calling it a double dip recession. Good news for the US
market as Seattle won Superbowl 43-8 against Denver, which is what the bulls, wanted to see. But of a
thrashing in the end so expect some positive sentiment to leak into the US tonight. Big crackdown at the
moment on the shadow economy in Korea as President Hye tries to squeeze an extra US$25 bn in
revenue from the undocumented economy.South Korea's shadow economy was equal to 24.7 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, above an average 18.3 percent for 39 OECD members and 11 percent
for Japan, according to a paper by the Institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn, Germany. The US state
department has raised no major environmental objections to the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada,
according to a new report. Same guys did the Barrier Reef one! Wal-Mart trims its trading outlook for this
year, citing a range of one-off costs including the closure of some stores in China. This is actually a sign
of an improving US economy as they are down the discount end of the retail chain, so shows some
strength in better quality and higher priced goods. And it looks like two Porsche directors are getting sued
for $1.8bn, over the failed takeover of Volkswagen, by a group of US hedge fund managers. Bless . There
is something rotten in the state of Denmark! It's a big ding dong with Goldmans at its epicentre. That's
what happens when you buy 20% of Dong from the Danes. That is all
