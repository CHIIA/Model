AGRICULTURE Minister Barnaby Joyce has warned supermarket retailers they need to start paying
farmers a decent return on production or they will lose out to higher-paying customers in China.

Speaking outside a grains industry conference in Melbourne, Mr Joyce said the $1 per litre price for
house-brand milk introduced by supermarket giant Coles in 2011 and quickly matched by Woolworths
and Aldi was unsustainable when NSW milk co-operative Norco was flying fresh milk to Shanghai to
sell for a minimum of $7 per litre.

“I think where dairy is going though is that the market will sort itself out, because we are moving milk by
air into China,’’ Mr Joyce said.
“In northern NSW it (the export) is up to 16,000 litres a week, and they want to go up to one million
litres a week, and they are getting between $7 and $12 a litre when it’s landed in Shanghai.

“This is sending a signal to the marketplace that if you want to pay people $1 a litre, you’re not going to
be in business much longer because there is a vastly greater demand out there, an insurmountable
demand.” Mr Joyce said that unless the supermarkets paid farmers a reasonable price for their milk it
would probably be converted to powdered form and sold into the export market.

“The smart thing for Coles and Woolworths to do is to pay more money to the farmers, make sure it gets
to the farmers, and lock in a long-term supply position so that it secures the farmers’ standard of living
and secures Coles and Woolworths and any other supermarkets’ access to supply,” Mr Joyce said.
“Otherwise you’re going to see some big processors coming into place, and more and more milk will be
converted to a dry commodity to the exclusion of domestic suppliers, and what was a great trick for a
few years there will turn into a very bad business plan in the long term.” Coles has signed a 10-year
supply deal with Victorian dairy co-operative Murray Goulburn which has not only locked in the $1 per
litre price but also given the co-op the cashflow needed to build new processing facilities in Melbourne
and Sydney at a cost of $160 million.Meanwhile Mr Joyce said he was pleased the Australian
Competition & Consumer Commission was taking Federal Court action against Coles over allegations of
unconscionable conduct relating to its treatment of suppliers in contravention of the Australian
Consumer Law.
