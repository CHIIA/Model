The market managed a small gain today having fought back valiantly from 10 down in very thin trading
conditions. In the end we closed up 3 points at 5543 at another 6 year high as it grinds away! Global
events have sidelined the equity markets as we await corporate results season which kicks off real soon.
Financials were generally weaker led by National Australia Bank Limited (A$34.20, -0.1%) and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (A$81.26, -0.1%) plus QBE Insurance Group Limited (A$11.67, -1.3%)
whilst resources were a little firmer with Iron Ore stocks shining through. BHP Billiton Limited (A$38.51,
+0.8%),RIO Tinto Limited (A$64.13, +0.7%) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (A$4.61, +0.9%) all fared
well as did Arrium Limited (A$0.775, +2.6%),Alumina Limited (A$1.495, +3.8%) and Bluescope Steel
Limited (A$5.91, +3.5%).

+6.3%),Panaust Limited (A$2.22, unch),Western Areas Limited (A$5.15, +3.8%),Iluka Resources Limited

flat, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (A$9.37, -0.4%) and Treasury Wine Estates Limited (A$5.08, -1.4%) and
the childcare sector breathed a sigh of relief on reports that the government is not considering hurting the
childcare providers in the productivity commission report. Both G8 Education Limited (A$4.68, +5.6%) and
Affinity Education Group Limited (A$1.17, +3.5%) which have been under some pressure had a good pop
today. Energy stocks pushed up as the oil price benefits from the global unrest, Woodside Petroleum
Limited (A$41.86, -0.8%) slipped though bucking the trend. Oil Search Limited (A$9.54, +0.4%),Lonestar
Resources Limited (A$0.585, +8.3%),Santos Limited (A$14.24, +0.6%),Sundance Energy Australia
Limited (A$1.285, +3.2%) and Antares Energy Limited (A$0.645, +0.8%) whilst Buru Energy Limited
(A$0.865, -3.4%) continued to suffer big time. Property trusts continued their stellar runs with GPT Group
(A$3.96, +2.3%),Dexus Property Group (A$1.185, +0.9%),#SGP and Charter Hall Group (A$4.21, +0.5%)
all shooting the lights out. Grinners today included Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (A$2.77, +10.8%),G8

Limited (A$2.34, -2.5%) and #COE,#AHZ# and Macquarie TelecomGroup Limited (A$5.50, -5.2%).
Volume would not even raise the eyebrow of a supermodel at again well under $3bn.Not quite sure where
everyone has gone. Maybe the fence seems a good place to be until reporting season throws up
opportunities. Funny how everyone thinks the market is expensive but no instos are selling as they don't
want to be the dumbo. In Asia, they have no such qualms Tokyo is up 0.9% whilst HK is up 1.39% and
China 1.29%.Aussie dollar is trying to push through the 94 ceiling after no jawbone from Glenn
today.Gold at 41308 and digital tulips at $665. Stocks and Stories Consumer confidence has rebounded
as the budget shock wears off. One reason is that so few of the measures have actually passed so it's
hardly surprising given the reality of the cuts is not here yet. Still it's good to know that the country is in
safe hands with new PUP senator Jackie Lambie's performance on Hobart junk radio this morning. Look it
up ,it worth listening too. Makes Pauline Hanson look like an intellectual! Silex Systems Limited (A$0.94,
unch) have gone into a trading halt pending an announcement regarding the terms of their
commercialisation deal for laser enrichment with GE. Western Areas Limited (A$5.15, +3.8%) had a good
day following numbers showing our fourth-largest miner of nickel, said it produced 28,686 tonnes in the
year ended June 30, 1,686 tonnes ahead of guidance. TPG and The Carlyle Group, the private equity

Page144of234©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.owners of Healthscope, decided to bring forward the institutional bookbuild to midday. Healthscope is
seeking to raise $2.25 billion to $2.57 billion at 20 times to 23 times forecast 2015 net profit. Oil Search
Limited (A$9.54, +0.4%) announced operating revenue over the June quarter was $339.7 million, against
$204.9 million for the same period a year ago. Quarterly production reached 3.69 million barrels of oil
equivalent, against 1.63 mmboe a year ago. Market liked this obviously and is looking forward to the
strategic review due in the third quarter. New flat #FFG# a Singaporean Internet seed company debuted
today at a healthy premium before stags too it back to parity. Boart Longyear Limited (A$0.12, +14.3%)
played the Lazarus card today despite S&P downgrading their debt rating a day or so ago. Positive
comments from the president helping things along. Uncle Glenn failed to jawbone the currency down in his
address to the Anika Foundation Charity lunch. Maybe not the right forum to make big statements. But
after, whilst smoking his cigar over a large brandy, he suggested that if he had to, he would cut rates again
if the economy needed it. Which it doesn't at the moment! Tomorrow's News Today The big news for the
week is the US GDP number on Friday and its possible that if its bad(weather related of course) the US
will be technically in a recession! Not sure how the Buy the dip mentality market will take that news. Could
get interesting. Or not! Indonesia is set today to declare Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo winner of the
closest presidential election in a decade Credit Suisse posted its biggest quarterly loss since 2008 after
settling an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for $2.6 billion in May.The bank's net loss in
the second quarter was 700 million Swiss francs ($779 million), compared with a profit of 1.05 billion
francs a year earlier, the Zurich-based company said in a statement today. China's total debt load has
climbed to more than two and a half times the size of its economy. The total debt-to-gross domestic
product ratio in the world's second-largest economy reached 251 per cent at the end of June, up from just
147 per cent at the end of 2008, according to a new estimate from Standard Chartered bank. Bit worried ,if
US is in debt ,Europe is in debt, Japan is way in debt ,China is in debt and Australia is in debt, who to?
Those Aliens are good business people! In the UK the serious fraud office has launched a criminal
investigation into allegations of price rigging in the &pound;3tn-a-day foreign exchange market. Seems the
French are so peeved with Russia that they are threatening to cancel the sale of the second helicopter
carrier ship. Not sure what good that will do as the Russians haven't even paid for it yet! Would have to put
it on eBay perhaps! Love the French they know how to apply serious pressure. Looks like Rupert is
serious about Time Warner as they move the goalposts to stop shareholders moving for a special
meeting. The Sly old (21st Century ) Fox will get the chicken in the end I suspect. He has form and
probably talked to Solly. That is all
