The company that attempted what would have been the biggest takeover in Australian history, the
acquisition of Rio Tinto, is giving up M&A.
BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie declared on Monday the mining giant is "all but
done" with buying new projects and will grow by sweating and expanding existing mines. After again
cutting the capital expenditure budget, he denied BHP's growth could be limited by its focus on
assets in iron ore, petroleum, copper and metallurgical coal.

"We have our arms around some of the best ore bodies in the world," he told investors at a briefing in
Sydney. "We are very reluctant to think about going after anything more. We have all the coal that
we want to grow, we have all the iron ore we want to grow . . . and positions at the bottom of the cost
curve."
BHP shares rose 3.8 per cent to $32.90 on Monday as the mining sector helped the S&P/ASX 200
gain 1 per cent. Iron ore miners were buoyed by interest rate cuts in China, which should underpin
demand for steel.
Mr Mackenzie shuffled his top team.  Peter Beaven will move from head of copper to chief financial
officer, and marketing boss Mike Henry swaps jobs with Dean Della Vale, the head of coal.
Company secretariat head Jane McAloon will leave after next year's as-yet unnamed corporate
spinoff.
