RUTHERGLEN is well known among many Australians as the perfect place for wine, food and
relaxation.
Now that reputation is set to grow overseas with a Chinese company’s decision to build a day spa
and hotel as part of a multimillion-dollar investment in the Rutherglen Estates winery and Tuileries
Rutherglen.

Rayah Estates Holdings, the owners of both Rutherglen Estates and Tuileries, is aiming to enhance
Rutherglen’s future and its reputation as one of the best recreational destinations in Victoria.
Already the company is exporting more than 50 containers of wine to China.

The plan is to build six two-storey villas and 10 hotel-style units at Tuileries, with a further proposal
for a $4.3 million conference/reception area including a day spa and tennis courts.

Construction is due to start early next year and there will be jobs for 25 people once it is completed.

While Rutherglen wines and wineries have a strong reputation among homegrown visitors, many will
hoping this decision by the Chinese will offer potential for further growth for the region’s tourism
among a wider international audience.
