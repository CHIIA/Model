Reporting today:

*ALL: Aristocrat reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $50.7 mln, div 8c/$57.7 mln, div 7c.

* A leading broker retained an "accumulate" on Aristocrat with a $6.85 price target ahead of its first half
result tomorrow.

At the full year 2013 result Aristocrat had guided for strong NPAT growth in full year 2014 driven by
momentum in the US and share gains in Australia, partly offset by a significant uplift in R&D spend.

The broker said the market will increasingly focus on the second half outlook, with the broker expecting
growth to accelerate 39% in the second half.

There is the possibility of capital management at the full year 2014 result.

*PRG: Programmed reports for the full year.

Analysts expectations: $33 mln, div 9.2c/$33.1 mln, div 10c.

*A leading broker retained a "lighten" on Programmed with a $2.90 price target ahead of its full year profit
report tomorrow. The broker expects PRG to report a net profit of $32.7 million up 1.7% on the year ago
and underlying net profit of $33.1 million down 2.5% on the previous year with a fully franked final
dividend of 10c.

The broker said the recent Spotless IPO valuation supports the underlying business valuation. Spotless
competes with much of PRG's property and infrastructure business and is trading at an EBIT margin of
3.6% in full year 2014 vs PG trading on a 2015 EBIT multiple of 5x.

*WES: Wesfarmers strategy briefing.

Analysts comment: A leading broker yesterday retained an "equal weight" on Wesfarmers with a price
target of $43.
The broker lowered its EBIT estimates for WES Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers business by 1% and
11% for full year 2015 and 2016 saying there was a looming oversupply to ammonium nitrate, where WES
is investing $550 million to construct a third AN plant to expand production by 260,000 tpa to 780,000
tpa, expected to become operational in the 4th quarter 2014.

However the broker added, this equates to less than a 1% cut in WES' group EPS.
The broker forecast NPAT this year of $2.359 billion, rising to $2.706 billion next year.

Changes in substantials reported May 26 and 27 inc posted separately.
