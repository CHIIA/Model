Deal of the week
Westfield Group Chairman Frank Lowy can now move ahead with the A$70 billion plan to restructure his
global property empire after a knife-edge "yes" vote from investors.

Approximately 76.09% of Westfield Retail Trust shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, passing the
required 75% threshold by a narrow margin. The shopping center giant can now merge its Australasian
business with Westfield Retail to form the Scentre Group. The global operations focusing mostly on the
U.S. and the U.K. will be called Westfield Corp.

The much-anticipated vote followed the adjournment of the original May 29 meeting that was suspended
midstream.

The final outcome also marks the end of months of wrangling between the boards and Westfield Retail
investors. To get the deal over the line, Westfield Retail ran a campaign to swing dissenters and bring
more shareholders into the game.
Separately, the company is planning to launch a new slate of shopping center redevelopments across
Australia to increase returns for the proposed Scentre Group in coming years, The Australian reported.

M&A activity
* Stockland CEO Mark Steinert has signaled that the company is not likely to sweeten its A$2.5 billion bid
for Australand Property Group to match a higher bid from Frasers Centrepoint Ltd., the Australian
Associated Press reported.

Other deal activity
* New World Development Co. Ltd.'s HK$18.6 billion privatization bid for New World China Land Ltd. was
shot down by minority investors holding just 0.16% of shares in the China subsidiary.
Since the target is a Cayman Islands-registered company, the law requires shareholder votes to be
based on head count instead of the number of shares held. New World Development must now wait 12
months before it can launch another offer for the subsidiary.
However, the nixed deal leaves the parent company sitting on a cash pile, as it managed to raise more
than HK$13 billion in cash from an April rights issue in order to fund its takeover of the subsidiary.
Analysts say the proceeds have already lowered gearing and can be applied toward redeveloping the
company's New World Centre in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui.

* Lend Lease Corp. Ltd. got approval from the New South Wales government for the construction of a
35-story, 600-room hotel as part of an A$2.5 billion transformation of the Sydney Convention Centre.
* Citigroup Inc. purchased a new office tower in Hong Kong's Kowloon East from developer Wheelock
Properties Ltd. for HK$5.43 billion. The 21-story tower at One Bay East will be the bank's new hub in
Hong Kong and will house staff spread across multiple offices throughout the city.

more than 5,000 acres of reclaimed land near Johor, Malaysia. The project, dubbed Forest City, will also
include a man-made island.
* DLF Ltd. raised 3.75 billion Indian rupees via the issuance of commercial MBS against its south
Delhi-based luxury mall DLF Promenade Ltd.

* Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. is going to venture into the affordable housing business and plans
to offer homes in Boisar in the outskirts of Mumbai and Avadi in Chennai, India.
