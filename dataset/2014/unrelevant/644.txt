Local shares had their worst session in a month as investors rushed to offload mining stocks after
disappointing Chinese export data released over the weekend sparked renewed fears about ongoing
demand growth from Australia's largest trading partner.
Australia's biggest export, iron ore, is fetching the lowest price in eight months amid fears that tighter
credit conditions in China will dampen demand for the steel-making ingredient.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 50.8 points, or 0.9 per cent, on Monday to 5411.5. It
was the biggest daily fall on the local bourse since February 4.
Equity markets in the United States edged higher on Friday after official non-farm payrolls data
showed employment is improving more than expected in the world's biggest economy. But the
positive lead from the US was overshadowed after China reported the biggest drop in exports since
the global financial crisis, and inflation slowed to a 13-month low.
The spot price for iron ore, landed in China, lost 2.3 per cent to an eight-month low of $US114.20 a
tonne, while Shanghai copper futures plunged to the lowest level since September 2009.
In China on Monday afternoon, the currency lost 0.5 per cent. The People's Bank of China lowered
the daily reference rate for the renminbi by 0.18 per cent, the most since July 2012. In Chinese
equities, the Shanghai Composite Index was trading more than 2.5 per cent lower.
On Friday in China, Chaori Solar became the first company allowed to default on a publicly traded
bond since the market was regulated in 1997.'These are temporary pressures'
"Chinese steel inventories are relatively high at the moment and rumours have been flying around the
market that tighter credit conditions will force some of the mills to start de-stocking to allow them to
pay back loans," Alphinity Asset Management portfolio manager Stephane Andre said.
If China's steel industry decides to run down supply, it will put further pressure on the price of
steel-making commodities iron ore and coal.

"These are temporary pressures due to the PoBC's liquidity squeeze that I expect will ease in a
month, but the prospect of China's steel mills de-stocking at the same time as Australia's biggest
miners are increasing supply is unnerving," Mr Andre said.
Mining was the worst-performing sector, down 4 per cent as resources giant BHP Billiton shed
4.1 per cent to $36.16. Rio Tinto, Australia's biggest iron ore miner, lost 5.8 per cent to $61.20, while
Fortescue Metals Group fell 9.4 per cent to $4.92. Junior iron ore miners, notably Arrium, Atlas Iron
and BC Iron, were among the hardest hit.
UBSChina analyst Tao Wang wrote that he still expects China's exports to strengthen through 2014
on the back of reviving US and European demand.

partners and major competitors, the export recovery may be weaker than the 10 per cent
year-on-year annual growth UBS is currently forecasting," Mr Wang said.Leighton tops bourse
Energy stocks were mostly lower as Brent crude oil fell to $US108.43 a barrel, but Australia's biggest
oil producer, Woodside Petroleum, added 0.1 per cent to $38.71. Oil and gas developer Santos lost
1.8 per cent to $14.07 as it suffered a setback in its efforts to gain public acceptance for coal seam
gas after revelations of a lingering problem with uranium contamination in groundwater in the Pilliga
forest.

Telstra Corporation shed 0.8 per cent at $5.03, and the big four banks were also lower.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 0.3 per cent to $75.75, while Westpac Banking Corporation lost
0.4 per cent to $33.77. National Australia Bank shed 0.3 per cent to $34.65, and ANZ Banking Group
dropped 0.8 per cent to $32.31.

Construction and engineering contractor Leighton Holdings was the best-performing stock in the
ASX 200, climbing 11.4 per cent to $23.09, on the news controlling shareholder Hochtief has made a
$1.15 billion conditional cash takeover at $22.15 per share.

Clothing and footwear group Pacific Brands surged 8.7 per cent to 56¢ following a block trade of
10 million shares at 53¢ a piece.

Healthcare was the best-performing sector, up 0.8 per cent, as plasma and vaccine maker CSL
added 0.8 per cent to $72.48.
