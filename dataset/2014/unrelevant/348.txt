The S&P/ASX200 closed up 27.1 points to 5464 after shedding 5.1 points on matchout, on almost average
volume worth $3.8 billion. There were 598 issues higher and 422 down. The SPI Futures was up 19
points to 5461 on lightish volume of 18,350 contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 1 point to
3.77%. The $A is at 93.30 US c, up about 55 points on last evening.

*The banks contributed 18.9 positive points to the index, insurers contributed 0.3 positive points, resources
contributed 2 negative points, property trusts contributed 0.3 positive points, retailers contributed 0.5
positive points, Telstra contributed 3.4 negative points.

Over the week our market fell 28.5 points or 0.5%.
*Reuters reports China will further tighten supervision over the shadow banking sector, the country's
banking regulator said on Friday, part of an ongoing campaign to control off-balance sheet lending by the
country's financial institutions.
However at the same time, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) will continue to support
buyers of affordable housing, first-time home buyers and small- and medium- sized businesses amid signs
of a slowing economy. "Currently, the economy, broadly speaking, is stable. But downward pressures are
relatively significant which is a reflection of ... imperfect financing structures, inefficiencies in finance
allocation and use and difficulties with SME (small and medium enterprises) financing," a press release
circulated at the CBRC's conference said. Wang Zhaoxing, a vice president at the China Banking
Regulatory Commission, told a news conference that the regulator will improve ways to manage
deposit-to-loan ratios, an indicator of a bank's ability to absorb risk, and classify bad loans.

*At 4pm AEST the NikkeiDow futures was up 30 points to 15,090 points, Shanghai CSI physical was down
11.56 points to 2029.32, Hang Seng futrues was down 68 points to 22,917 points, S&P futures was up 2.6
points to 1941.10, Nasdaq futures was up 6.75 points to 3783 points, Dow futures was up 35 points to
16,853 points.
Gold futures were up $2 to $1255. Crude futures rose 7c to $102.55.
The rise in our market was all the more surprising since the China markets were weaker - and the gain in
the US and Japan after the ECB lowered rates to make the Euro more competitive against other
currencies is hard to fathom - unless it means the precedent has been set making negative interest rates
more available to the US and Japan?
Meanwhile, there are US job numbers out tonight and several eco numbers out of China and Japan next
week, beginning Sunday.

"Resistance is at 5450, then at 5470 .. up 25 points for the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "There was a positive reaction on equities last night on
the ECB move.

Page114of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The S&P500 again broke previous highs intra day, closing not far off its high for the night Volume last
night was the highest so far this week, but not at the highest levels we have seen.
"Copper is still sitting on support, there was not much price action last night.
"Gold had a bit of a bounce. It is likely to have a bit of a dead cat bounce in coming days but I still think it
will remain under pressure for the rest of this year.

"The Euro briefly spiked down to 1.35US c which was one of the DCB plans, to devalue their currency, but
it defied the odds to sharply push back to 1.38/30US c at one stage.

"Shanghai saw a good move yesterday, closing above the 20 day moving average and above 2040 so that
it looks like it was a false break on Thursday. We still need to see it close above 2060 for any signs of a
bullish breakout.

"US 10 year bond yields took a bit of a breather last night, but probably are going to consolidate between
2.55% and 2.65%.

"The XJO had another weak day. We have seen a lot of selling pressure against the rising US market.
Yesterday's close was again bearish. It did not close on its lows, but closed well below 5450.

"Given moves on markets overnight, it may close back above 5450 for the week, but still remain below the
20 day moving average.

"Our market is still in a short term correction. But I would not be surprised to see DAX and Euro stocks fall
in coming weeks.

"Resistance for our market is at 5450, next at 5470. Support will now be 5430.

The short term outlook is still bearish in my view. For the day I will call us up 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 7.9 points to 5436.9 last evening.

NSW Councils win case against S&P appeal, will recover $30 mln in losses

"The Age" reports Standard & Poor’s, ABN Amro and Local Government Financial Services (LGFS) will
pay $30 million in legal costs and compensation to over a dozen Australian councils after the global credit
ratings agency lost its appeal in the Federal court today. In a landmark decision of global significance, the
appeals were dismissed unanimously by Justice’s Jacobson, Gilmour and Gordon, with exception of one
cross appeal under section 1041E.

“S&P new that it had no reasonable basis for putting a AAA rating on the investments,” said council
spokesperson, John Walker, Managing Director of IMF Europe.

The NSW councils, including the City of Ryde, Bathurst-Regional, Cooma Monaro and Deniliquin will now
be able to recover $30 million in losses after a four year battle.

Prior to the global financial crisis the councils invested heavily on the basis of AAA credit ratings,
determined by S&P.

Page116of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The councils invested in complex synthetic derivatives known as constant proportion debt obligations
(CPDO’s), otherwise known as ‘rembrandt notes’ that were rated AAA by S&P, arranged by ABN AMRO
and sold by LGFS.

The investments subsequently tanked during the GFC and the councils lost 93% of their investments.

requirements by the end of June as part of its 5000 company-wide staff cutting exercise.

Around 80 of them will be offered retraining on various other aircraft - but many of these would require
relocation to other cities - in particular Adelaide.

The scheme will offer voluntary redundancy packages of one year's pay for those with more than 15 years

Profit guidance
The company revised profit guidance issued with the interim report in February that VRL expected it
would slightly exceed 2013 NPAT before material items.

write off of the $2 million minimum guarantee write off, the forecast 2014 NPAT is now likely to be in line
with or slightly below 2013 NPAT. (Jun 5)
