Another day in the doldrums as a mildly positive start gave way to some selling pressure. The better than
expected GDP number didn't help the rate cut junkies and the dollar firmed after GDP came in a 1.1% for
the first quarter, 3.5% for the year. I suspect that the second quarter won't be quite as good. In the final
wash up the ASX200 closed down 35 points at 5445 with a high of 5483

Talking to a few market players today, there are 8 IPOs live at the moment. The current weakness could
be attributed to the sound of money leaving the market to buy a slice of these. Most sectors were easier
today with property trusts the exception after more corporate activity. Banks were the major drag with the
big four losing 0.5-1%.Even conservative Telstra Corporation Limited (A$5.32, -0.7%) copped it today as
stories of price cutting to compete with Optus abound. Let's face it the pack always catches up eventually
with the pink jersey and then they sprint to the line. In the green were Westfield Group (A$10.77, +0.4%),
Westfield Retail Trust (A$3.22, +0.3%), Dexus Property Group (A$1.15, +1.3%), Australand Property
Group (A$4.55, +5.6%) and Stockland (A$4.01, +1.8%).

Resources struggled led by BHP Billiton Limited (A$36.16, -0.7%) and RIO Tinto Limited (A$59.44, -0.4%)
but surprisingly the golds showed good gains. Looks like the bargain hunters are starting to pick over the
carcasses. Newcrest Mining Limited (A$9.84, +1.1%), Kingsgate Consolidated Limited (A$0.765, +7.0%),
Regis Resources Limited (A$1.485, +5.3%) and Silver Lake Resources Limited (A$0.35, +4.5%) all
showing Iron Ore stocks how it's done. Nickel gave back some gains...get it, Nickelback...I really am
wasted! Western Areas Limited (A$4.60, -3.0%) and Mincor Resources NL (A$0.905, -4.2%) falling
heavily.

In the industrial space Wesfarmers Limited (A$42.74, -0.6%), Woolworths Limited (A$37.01, -1.4%) and
Brambles Limited (A$9.40, -2.9%) were surprisingly weak as were media stocks and retailers. Even bid
target David Jones Limited (A$3.83, -2.8%) failed to excite as Solly creeps up the register. A week ago
this was a done deal, now the wheels have fallen off. Gotta love a corporate spoiler to rain on a South
African parade.

Winners and Losers today included in the green corner Australand Property Group (A$4.55, +5.6%),
Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (A$1.435, +6.3%), Oceanagold Corporation (A$2.57, +3.2%), Regis
Resources Limited (A$1.485, +5.3%), Mayne Pharma Group Limited (A$0.925, +3.4%), Quickflix, Crowe
Horwath Australasia Ltd (A$0.48, +14.3%) and Papillon Resources Limited (A$1.57, +10.2%). In the red
corner were Karoon Gas Australia Limited (A$3.42, -5.3%), Sirius Resources NL (A$3.08, -4.9%),
Aquarius Platinum Limited (A$0.445, -4.3%), Mesoblast Limited (A$4.53, -4.4%) and Fairfax Media
Limited (A$0.98, -4.4%) in the "bigs" and Iron Road Limited (A$0.29, -14.7%), Western Desert Resources
Limited (A$0.225, -8.2%) in the smalls.

Volume was once again pretty hopeless around $3.6bn, as we wait for US jobs numbers and the mega
announcement form Super Mario. Aussie dollar remained form after GDP number at 92.68, Bitcons format
$687 and Gold at $1245. Asian markets were mixed as Tokyo continues to push higher but HK and
Shanghai were both off, 0.6% and 1.3% respectively.
Stocks and Stories Oil Search Limited (A$9.35, -1.0%) looks to have left it late for a production and cost
update but it looks positive on the face of it. Production now 17-20 mmboe and operating costs $18-22
boe. Looks positive all round. Stock back Thursday.

Page258of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Australand Property Group (A$4.55, +5.6%): Singapore company Frasers pounced on the long-standing
takeover target this morning, offering $2.6 billion or $4.48 per security for the trust in an all-cash bid. That
compares with Stockland's final $2.5 billion share swap proposal struck at $4.42.

Papillon Resources Limited (A$1.57, +10.2%) came out of suspension today with news of their impending
merger with B2Gold. PIR holders will get 0.861 B2Gold shares listed in Toronto.

Karoon Gas Australia Limited (A$3.42, -5.3%) heading backwards today as the impetus to cover the
shorts fades. I would expect them to find a level soon.

Acrux Limited (A$0.77, -9.4%) continuing to suffer from fall out over side effects from their testosterone
treatment.

More bid activity today with news that Crowe Horwath Australasia Ltd (A$0.48, +14.3%) has entered
exclusive takeover talks with the nation's biggest non-bank affiliated financial planning group, Findex
Australia, backed by private equity group KKR Asset Management.

Despite signing up the star of Wedding Crashes, Owen Wilson, to be the CFO, REA Group Ltd (A$42.70,
-2.8%) seem to be coming off their highs. Cabcharge Australia Limited (A$4.09, unch) also made a new
signing a month after Reg picked up his last fare. And Uber in the US is now valued at more than Hertz!
The world truly is either mad or I am too old to figure that one out!

NBL shrugged off dismal profit outlook as the 40% controlling family, Kindl, look to take the group private.

Billabong International Limited (A$0.54, -1.8%) took it pretty well today considering their rival Quicksilver
issued a massive profit warning and the stock dropped in and traded down 41% last night in the US.
Wipeout!

Seems all the focus is on who is bidding for whom. Feels just like the 80s! Good times. Great Classic Hits!

Tomorrow's News Today

On Tuesday, Europe's statistics agency reported that annual euro zone inflation slumped to 0.5 percent in
May from 0.7 percent in April, falling further below the 2 percent level that the European Central Bank
considers healthy. Even in Germany, which has been the euro zone's stalwart economy, inflation fell to a
0.9 percent rate in May, its lowest level in four years

Doc Neeson dead at 67. Very sad. No Way.
Seems that growth has not come as expected in Singapore, as company debts rose to six times the
amount of operating cash flow in 2013 for non-financial Singaporean companies, from 5.1 times in 2012,
The leverage ratio in China rose to 7.5 times from 6.8 times last year, while the measure in India grew to
8.1 times from 7 times, the May 28 report showed.

Mortgage wars are heating up here as the banks battle to cut rates for the best customers at sometimes
1.1% off the normal rate. If you borrow more than a $1m and have $200k for a deposit. That's pretty much
everyone on the borrowing anyway in Sydney these days. That cannot be good for banking shares but
maybe no one is listening. May need brokers even more.

Meanwhile in the UK the RBS has said that they will limit mortgages under its RBS and Natwest brands to
four times the applicant's income if more than &pound;500,000 is being borrowed. It will also restrict these
loans to a maximum 30-year term, in order to prevent borrowers taking out larger mortgages by spreading
out repayment over a longer period. Didn't realise you could borrow over 30 years. Last time that
happened was in Japan in the 80's and we all know how that ended up.

Is this just me or is nearly 19m Europeans unemployed a sign that the great Euro experiment is working.
There are 3.4m young people out of work! A sustained recovery has yet to take hold in the Eurozone, with
growth slowing to 0.2% in the first quarter, down from 0.4% in the previous quarter. So Mario time to act?

And good to see the French government wading into the '$10bn fine for BNP' row. It's always good to
know the French have your back. Anyone remember the Maginot line? US must be quaking!

If you are up early I am on Sky Biz at 0630hrs. And we all know what the 0 stands for right. 'Oh my god its
early.'

That is all
