PROMENADE, a luxury residential development being built on the banks of Parramatta River, is on
its way with the first sod turned last week.

The third stage 1 building, featuring 153 apartments, will be released in August.

mid-2016.Representatives of Fuxing and sales agents Savills Australia turned the first sod of the
