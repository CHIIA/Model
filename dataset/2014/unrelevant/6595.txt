Origin Energy takes 40% stake in two blocks for $800 million

After a year of negotiations with several companies, Australian explorer Karoon Gas has agreed to sell
its 40% stakes in two highly prospective offshore gas blocks to Origin Energy for up to $800 million.

Origin has agreed to buy Karoon's stakes in ConocoPhillips-operated permits WA-315-P, and
WA-398-P in the gas-rich Browse Basin, offshore northwestern Australia.

Karoon said Monday that it expects the deal to be completed during the third quarter of this year.

WA-315-P is home to the 2009 Poseidon gas find which could contain up to 15 Tcf gas, while
WA-398-P contains the August 2013 Proteus gas find that is still being evaluated.

Operator ConocoPhillips has a 40% share in both blocks. The other partner is state-owned PetroChina
which bought its 20% stakes in February 2013.

The two companies retain preemption rights "for a limited period" on Karoon's 40% interest, Origin said.
Under the terms of the deal announced Monday, Origin will pay Karoon $600 million in cash for its
40% share of the two permits, plus $75 million when a final investment decision is reached on
commercialization and $75 million on first production. A further payment of up to $50 million will be
payable on first production, if proven and probable reserves "at the time of FID reach certain
thresholds," Origin said in a statement.
Karoon added that Origin will pay $5 million for every 100 Bcf equivalent of independently certified 2P
reserves exceeding 3.25 Tcf equivalent across the two permits at the time of FID, up to a maximum
$50 million.

"In addition, Origin will be responsible for all costs associated with the current Pharos-1 exploration well
located in permit WA-398-P," Karoon said.

Pharos-1, the sixth and final well in the partners' six-well drilling campaign, is designed to target an
extension of the Proteus discovery. It lies 9 km northeast of Proteus-1.

Strategic fit
"The acquisition complements recent [Origin] farm-ins in South Australia's Cooper Basin and the
Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin, thereby increasing Origin's exposure to growing demand for
natural gas both in Australia and overseas," Origin Managing Director Grant King said in a statement.
In a separate investor presentation Monday, King said the acquisition "allows Origin to establish a
strategic position in one of Australia's largest recent offshore gas discoveries at a competitive entry
price when compared to recent Browse/Bonaparte transactions."

Brazil's Santos Basin, Australia's Carnarvon Basin and Peru's Tumbes Basin.

The independent explorer said the deal with Origin reduced a "large scale LNG development capex
overhang; and allows the Board to consider possible strategic capital management initiatives."

"Origin will participate in the ongoing exploration and appraisal program—including the Pharos well
which is currently being drilled by the joint venture...Options to monetize the Poseidon field resources
may include transporting natural gas to LNG production facilities in Darwin or through a standalone
floating LNG facility," Origin said.

The two permits lie in the Browse Basin, an area some 450 km offshore northwestern Australia, which
already hosts significant known gas reserves.

Browse Basin projects being developed for LNG exports include Prelude, Browse and Ichthys. Two of
those—Browse and Prelude—have already been lined up for an FLNG option.

Origin is also a partner with ConocoPhillips in the Australia Pacific LNG joint venture. The two
companies hold stakes of 37.5% each in the A$24.7 billion project, which is currently under
construction in Queensland, northeastern Australia.
The other partner in the two-train 9 million mt/year coalseam gas-to-LNG export project is China's
Sinopec with a 25% share. APLNG is due to load its first cargo in mid-2015
