Pump yields well

The 7-Eleven convenience store and service station at 137 Great Western Highway, Blaxland (pictured
above), has sold for $3.31 million, with an estimated net yield of 6.1 per cent, to a private investor. JLL's
director of sales and investments for NSW, Michael Ajaka, said the buyer bought the property with an
existing 15-year lease plus three five-year options to 2041, reflecting how popular these properties have
become for small investors. "Service stations remain an attractive asset class, particularly when they
feature secure long-term leases to ensure ongoing return on investment for many years to come," he
said. JLL's senior negotiator for NSW sales and investments, Dylan McEvoy, said demand was high at a
time when there was a shortage of stock of branded sites from Caltex, Shell and 7-Eleven on the
market.

in Australian hotel transactions in the first half of 2014. The boutique hotel occupies a refurbished
wool store that was built in 1888.
