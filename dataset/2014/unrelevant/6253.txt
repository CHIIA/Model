A day to rest as once again banks showed a clean pair of heals whilst resource stocks were walloped.
BHP Billiton Limited (A$33.32, -1.4%),RIO Tinto Limited (A$59.03, -1.3%),Fortescue Metals Group Ltd
(A$3.35, unch),Newcrest Mining Limited (A$9.70, -1.0%) and the oils well and truly on the nose. A narrow
range for the day with a low of 5433 and a high of 5458 on low volumes of around $3.5bn as we limped
towards Medibank Private and the bank results. Most of the volume seemed to occur in the last hour! In
the final analysis we closed down 6 points at 5453 ensuring the uptrend is still intact.

Good to see Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (A$33.41, +0.2%) back on after its
trading halt due to it embarrassingly releasing some of its numbers last Friday, Westpac Banking
Corporation (A$34.89, +1.0%) also surged as did Insurance Australia Group Limited (A$6.21, +0.5%) and
Suncorp Group Limited (A$14.43, +0.5%) In the industrials Csl Limited (A$77.38, +1.4%) continue to be
the star performer with Mesoblast Limited (A$4.06, +5.2%) joining in as did Sirtex Medical Limited
(A$25.19, +2.0%) but other biotechs fared less well with #PBT# and Bionomics Limited (A$0.54, -2.7%)
down and out. In telcos Amcom Telecommunications Limited (A$2.25, +7.7%) continued to bubble around
following the approach from Vocus Communications Limited (A$5.90, +8.5%) and Telstra Corporation
Limited (A$5.55, +0.2%),Tpg Telecom Limited (A$7.27, +1.8%),#SPK#,M2 Telecommunications Group
Limited (A$8.05, +1.5%) and iiNet Limited (A$8.13, +1.6%) all ringing the right number. Qantas Airways
Limited (A$1.61, +7.3%) continued their spectacular run but mining services continued to suffer on AGM
comments from WorleyParsons Limited (A$13.25, -2.6%) although Boart Longyear Limited (A$0.26,
+8.3%) continued to find friends following their near death experience. Hogging the limelight today were
Vocus Communications Limited (A$5.90, +8.5%),Amcom Telecommunications Limited (A$2.25,
+7.7%),Qantas Airways Limited (A$1.61, +7.3%),Mesoblast Limited (A$4.06, +5.2%),Billabong
International Limited (A$0.69, +5.3%) and #TFS# in the biggies and #NEA#,Boart Longyear Limited
(A$0.26, +8.3%) and #CVN# in the small end. Copping it today were #VET#,Karoon Gas Australia Limited
(A$2.90, -5.8%),Beach Energy Limited (A$1.235, -6.8%),Oz Minerals Limited (A$3.75, -4.8%) and Arrium
Limited (A$0.325, -4.4%)(notice a pattern?) and Beadell Resources Limited (A$0.275, -14.1%)(company
update),#SFX#,#MVF# and BC Iron Limited (A$1.14, -14.0%). Aussie dollar was 88.199 and bitcons at

1.07% Stocks and Stories Virgin Australia Holdings Limited (A$0.385, unch) chairman Neil Chatfield has
revealed he intends to step down. Every day that goes by that oil is around $80 and the airlines don't pass
on the savings will be a good day for airline profits. Beach Energy Limited (A$1.235, -6.8%) posted a 14
per cent decline in September quarter revenues, with sales dragged down by a dip in oil prices and softer
oil production. Revenues for the three month period slid to $232.9 million, as production dipped to 2.4
million barrels of oil equivalent, down from 2.46 million a year earlier Vocation Ltd (overdone!!!) which
raised $74 million in a placement to institutions at $3.05 a share in early September, finally revealed late
on Monday it would be forced to forfeit $19.6 million of funds after a commercial settlement with the
Victorian government. The company now expects full-year EBITDA to be between $53 million and $57
million for 2014-15, which is 10 to 15 per cent below consensus earnings forecasts in the market. BC Iron
Limited (A$1.14, -14.0%) updated the market. DOH! The iron ore junior's revised down sales guidance for
FY15 to 5.2-5.6 million wet metric tonnes from 5.8-6.2 million wmt. WorleyParsons Limited (A$13.25,
-2.6%) too got hit today dragging the mining services stocks down too as the company suggested that
challenging conditions in global resources markets were set to continue. ChinaeCommerce wannabe
#NNW# announced a tie up today with China Unionpay and promptly pushed up 20%.Nice! Stockland

most in four months as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe weighs another bump in the sales tax levy. Sales
climbed 2.7 percent in September from August when they rose 1.9 percent, the trade ministry said today in
Tokyo. Tomorrow's News Today Seems a dodgy Rolex is not the only dodgy thing in HK/China. Someone
seems to be fiddling the export books as China recorded $1.56 of exports to Hong Kong last month for
every $1 in imports Hong Kong registered, leading to a $13.5 billion difference, according to government
data. Mmmm. Interesting moves today in Asia's biggest commodity trader. Noble Group fell as much as
10 percent today in Singapore after large blocks of shares changed hands in early trade. Eighteen blocks
of 200,000 or more shares were sold between S$1.165 and S$1.195, against a close yesterday of
S$1.245. Twitter(fell 8% after hours) has reported a doubling in sales and a 23% increase in the number of
active users for the third quarter. It added 13 million monthly active users between July and September,
meaning it now has 284 million users. Sales rose 114% to US$361m but it made a loss of $175m for the
period. Still worth $26 bn though!!! Gotta love the thought though. France's finance minister says the
country plans to cut its budget deficit by &euro;3.6-3.7bn) next year in a bid to meet European Union
