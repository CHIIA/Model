The Chinese miner says the broad outlook remains positive
CHINESE state-controlled metals miner MMG has declared it remains confident in the price outlook
for copper, despite the dramatic fall for the economic bellwether metal in recent days.

It also has flagged its potential interest in any sale by BHP Billiton of its West Australian nickel
business, reported to be on the chopping block with the appointment of an investment bank to handle
a sale.
Copper prices have fallen by more than 8 per cent in the past week and it is trading at the lowest
level since July 2010, echoing the sharp retreat in iron ore prices in response to looming surplus
supply and a tightening of credit in China squeezing traders in the steelmaking raw material.
But the Melbourne-based and Hong Kong-listed MMG's chief executive Andrew Michelmore said
yesterday that while prices would fluctuate, the ``supply and demand side for copper is still pretty
good''. He said demand was underpinned by the ongoing electrification of China.
Speaking from Hong Kong, Mr Michelmore told The Australian that the Chinese economy was being
squeezed by Beijing as part of a plan to generate longer and more stable gross domestic product
growth of 7-7.5 per cent. He said it was the right move because easier credit conditions had given
rise to too many ``speculative money chasing opportunities'' in the economy.

Mr Michelmore was speaking after the release of MMG's 2013 profit report. Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortisation were up modestly to $US750.9 million despite the pressure of
lower copper and zinc prices on its operations in Australia, Laos and Africa.

Increased depreciation was the main factor in pulling net profit back from $US234m in 2012 to
$US122.5m, with the result ahead of most analyst forecasts.
Despite the 48 per cent fall in net profit, the company has declared a US1c dividend (nothing
previously), the bulk of which will go to its 73 per cent shareholder, China Minmetals Corp.
Minmetals last week confirmed that it was leading a Chinese consortium in talks to buy
GlencoreXstrata's $US6bn Las Bambas copper development in Peru, the sale of which -- or other
nominated copper assets -- was part of Beijing's approval last year of Glencore's merger with Xstrata.
While it is assumed MMG would be involved in any Las Bambas acquisition, Mr Michelmore would
not be drawn on the potential deal. ``We don't comment on these matters,'' he said. But he added that
MMG ``really likes copper'' and South America as an investment destination.

``And we are after assets that have a long life and offer decent margins.''

Mr Michelmore said MMG would continue to be a dispassionate acquirer of assets. ``We look at lots
of (merger and acquisition) opportunities but we don't want to destroy value.''

value-adding. Mr Michelmore said that would also be the case with the possible sale by BHP of its
WA nickel assets, which it inherited in its 2005 takeover of WMC. Mr Michelmore was WMC's chief
executive at the time of the takeover.
Asked if MMG was interested in any sale by BHP, Mr Michelmore said: ``We look at a lot of things.
But we come back to: can we add value, what's the life like? Certainly we like nickel sulphides.''
