Chan Wah Tiong, lead independent non-executive director of Hiap Hoe, sold 93,750 of his shares in the
property developer and construction group on July 24. The shares were sold in three transactions at
an average price of 91 cents each. Following the sale, Chan has no shares in the company.
Hiap Hoe is known for the development of luxury and mid-tier residential and hotel-cum-commercial
properties. Its residential portfolio includes Treasure on Balmoral, Skyline 360° at St Thomas Walk,
Waterscape at Cavenagh, The Beverly, Signature at Lewis, Oxford Suites and Cuscaden Royale. The
group also owns an integrated hotel-cum-commercial development on Balestier Road.

While the group expects the local property market to remain lacklustre in the near term, it will continue
to step up its marketing efforts to sell the remaining units of its residential projects. It recently launched
HH @ Kallang, an industrial development on Kallang Pudding Road expected to be completed in 2016.
On the regional front, Hiap Hoe recently launched Marina Tower Melbourne for sale. This is the
residential component of a 40,849 sq ft mixed-development site in Melbourne’s Docklands. The project
comprises two residential towers totalling 461 freehold residential units and Four Points by Sheraton
Melbourne Docklands, a seven-storey hotel with 269 room keys.
In 1QFY2014 ended March, Hiap Hoe saw earnings rise to $354.2 million, from $9.8 million a year
earlier,
after revenues rose 2.8% of $31.2 million. The higher sales were mainly backed by rental income from
the group’s investment properties in Australia, as well as the consolidation of a one-month income from
subsidiary SuperBowl Holdings, in which the group owned a 97.8% stake as at March 31.
Meanwhile, Amy Lim, wife of former Pteris Global director Winston Tan, sold 3.7 million Pteris shares in
seven transactions from July 22 to Aug 11. The shares were sold at an average price of 14 cents each.
The sale was made via the couple’s investment vehicle, Winmark Investments. Winmark owns 9.3% of
Pteris, following Lim’s divestment.

Pteris is a provider of airport logistics solutions such as baggage and air cargo handling systems, inflight
catering and express courier systems. Pteris’ projects include installing baggage handling systems at
Changi Airport Terminal 3, Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Beijing Capital International
Airport. Its air cargo systems are installed at Chennai Airport in India and Heathrow Airport in London.

In April, Tan made headlines for his efforts to oust five of the nine directors at Pteris. Tan was against a
proposed reverse takeover of Shenzhen CIMC-Tianda Airport Support, owned by Hong Kong and
Shenzhen-listed China International Marine Containers (CIMC), its biggest shareholder, with a 14.99%
stake. Tan quit the board shortly after. On Aug 8, Pteris announced that it had received shareholder
approval for the RTO, extending a lifeline to the loss-making company.

For 1QFY2014 ended March, Pteris
posted revenues of $12.7 million, a 5% decrease y-o-y, while losses deepened to $5 million, from
$4.27 million a year earlier. Pteris shares closed at 14.4 cents each on Aug 12.
Elsewhere, Fong Kah Kuen, CEO of Xpress Holdings, saw his deemed interest in the printing company
fall to 0.4%, or 9.8 million shares, after his investment vehicle KK Fong Holdings sold 10.75 million

75.8 million shares.
On July 23, the group announced that several creditors have started legal proceedings against the
company and its subsidiary Xpress Print for $2.4 million due and owing.
A day earlier, the group had proposed the placement of 480 million new shares at 2.1 cents each. The
placement will raise net proceeds of $9.48 million, after deducting placement expenses. The company
intends to use 55% of the net placement proceeds to repay its creditors and the remaining 45% as
general working capital. For 3QFY2014 ended April, the group reported that earnings decreased to
$234,000, from $840,000 a year earlier, as revenue fell 24.1% to $4.7 million.
