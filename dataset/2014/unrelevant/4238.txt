Telstra wins again with NBN deal

A

revamped deal between the NBN Co, Telstra and Optus covering the rollout of the government's hybrid
broadband network is a milepost in a long journey, but an important one. Cabinet was set to consider the
new deal on Tuesday. Telstra's board and Optus's parent, Singtel, were in the wings, ready to approve it
once cabinet agreed. Announcements are expected as soon as Sunday, and contracts as thick as old
Telstra telephone directories should be signed before Christmas. The Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission will take months more to review the contacts, but agreement on co-operation and
terms is a breakthrough. As part of the deal, NBN Co will acquire the hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) cable
networks that Telstra and Optus rolled out in the mid-90s with their pay TV offers. It will upgrade and
merge them, fill gaps in their coverage, and use the HFC to accelerate its broadband rollout. The
government's hybrid broadband plan replaces Labor's national fibre to the home network, and patches
together fibre to the home, fibre to the neighbourhood node and the Telstra and Optus cable. It is
significantly different

architecture to Labor's but Telstra's demand that it be "kept whole" on its original $11.2 billion deal with
Labor and the NBN Co is going to be met, and then some. Telstra's original deal was valued at $11.2
billion on a net present value basis that discounted payments that were to flow over decades. Actual
payments over 55 years were estimated at $98 billion. The new deal should lock that value in and add to
it, because Telstra will also be paid as an adviser to the rollout and construction overseer. The
government for its part can seize on the announcement that a deal has been struck to argue that it is
making things happen. Its next big challenge however is to

demonstrate that its revised rollout is on budget. The hybrid fibre network was costed at a maximum of
$41 billion a year ago, but in its 2014-2017 corporate plan last month, NBN Co said there were too many
unknowns including the incomplete negotiations with Telstra and Optus for it to make forecasts for the
final two years of the plan "with a reasonable level of confidence". With the Telstra and Optus
negotiations finalised, it remains on course for what Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann say will be a more detailed corporate plan next year, covering 2015,
2016 and 2017. Whether they arrive then or

earlier, more complete projections are certainly going to be interesting. One question is whether the
hybrid project's revenue trajectory will hold up despite its exclusion of higher-speed, higher-price services
that were to be available on Labor's fibre to the home network. The very early takeup of the fastest,
highest price option on Labor's NBN was 23 per cent.

Another slide in the oil price sent the sharemarket into another nosedive yesterday, but the case remains
that a lower oil price creates winners as well as losers. As I mentioned last week, oil's 40 per cent price
plunge since the middle of this year does create
risks, for those who sell oil and those who finance them. Oil company earnings are tumbling, and
companies that have heavy debt loads including ones operating in the US shale oil sector are exposed.
Oil producing countries with weak balance sheets are, too. Russia is the standout there. After analysing
what it says is basically a transfer of income from oil exporting countries to oil importing countries, BNP
Paribas finds more national winners than losers, however. A fall in the oil price of $US10 a barrel should
boost US GDP by about 0.3 per cent, it says. The same price decline could boost the Eurozone's GDP by
about 0.4 per cent, although the European Central Bank might still ease

monetary policy as it struggles to fend off deflation. Australia's GDP should rise by about 0.1 per cent as
a result of a $10 a barrel price drop, BNP says. It also says that a $10 price drop should deliver an
across-the-board growth boost to Australia's most important trading region, Asia, including a growth boost
of 0.2 per cent for China. There are losers, of course. A $10 a barrel cut costs Russia 0.5 per cent of
GDP on BNP's oil price ready reckoner, and costs Canada and Norway 0.2 per cent of GDP. Most of the
world is on the right side of BNP's long-term oil price slide ledger however. That's something worth
keeping in mind as the markets whipsaw.
