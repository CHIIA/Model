BG has agreed to sell a gas pipeline linking its Australian coalbed methane (CBM) fields to its
Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) project for US$5 billion to APA Group, Australia's largest gas
infrastructure business.

The deal is part of BG's plan to sell noncore assets to shore up a balance sheet overstretched by hefty
spending commitments in Brazil and Australia and now threatened by falling oil prices. The UK gas
major's stock has lost some 30% of its value so far in 2014.

BG said the sale proceeds will be used to reduce debt and fund future growth investment. The
transaction is expected to result in a post-tax profit of approximately US$2.7 billion as profit on
disposal will be partly offset by a post-tax impairment of BG's remaining QCLNG assets, expected to be
around US$2 billion.
The US$5 billion sale of the 543 kilometer pipeline was concluded at a higher-than-expected price. It
was rumored earlier the asset would fetch around US$4 billion. The deal also signals that QCLNG may
soon be ready to export its first LNG cargo, which BG has repeatedly said would happen before
end-2014.

"The timing reflects QCLNG's advanced stage of development; we are now on the verge of delivering
the world's first large-scale project using natural gas from coal seams as a feedstock for LNG," said
BG's interim Executive Chairman Andrew Gould in a statement.
BG had first hinted in 2012 that it could sell the midstream company that holds the pipeline, QCLNG
Pipeline, as part of a portfolio rationalization program designed to enhance its focus on core oil and gas
exploration and LNG businesses. Other recent divestments include the sale earlier this year of its
62.78% stake in the UK North Sea Central Area Transmission System gas pipeline and associated
infrastructure to private equity investor Antin Infrastructure Partners for £562 million (US$954 million)
(IOD Jun.18'14). In 2012, it sold its 60.1% stake in Brazilian gas distributor Comgas for some US$1.8
billion (IOD Oct.4'12).
An industry source Energy Intelligence spoke to last month had also linked the imminent pipeline sale
to the start of LNG exports from the first train of BG's 8.5 million ton per year QCLNG plant.
One of the conditions for the sale to APA to go through is that the First Commercial Delivery Date
(FCDD) for the first train must occur by Apr. 30, 2015. That deadline could be extended to Jun. 30,
2015. The FCDD is believed to refer to the start of QCLNG's term LNG contracts with China National
Offshore Oil Co., expected to start in April 2015, with cargoes sold before seen as commissioning or
spot cargoes (IOD Mar.25'10).
If all goes to plan, BG plans to bring the second 4.25 million ton/yr train on line by mid-2015, by when
the first train should be running at its 4.25 million ton/yr capacity. The industry will be keenly watching
how smoothly production ramps up and stabilizes amid concerns about CBM output and additional
post-start-up costs.

Acknowledging the challenges after a 36% cost blowout in 2012 which has left QCLNG costing
US$20.4 billion, BG peppered its third-quarter conference call with cautionary statements. Chief
Operating Officer Sami Iskander noted that QLCNG is a "complex process and there may be unknown

performance over a number of years, is yet to be seen" (IOD May4'12).
The pipeline was constructed between 2011 and 2014 and has a current book value of US$1.6 billion.
BG and its partners have firm capacity rights in the pipeline for 20 years, with options to extend.
