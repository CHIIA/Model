Advice

WE SIX YOUNG ADULTS ARE GOING TO INDIA FOR THREE WEEKS IN FEBRUARY AND ARE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE TO DO. WE ARE THINKING
UTTARAKHAND AND THE HIMALAYAS, BUT ARE UNSURE WHETHER THIS IS POSSIBLE IN
WINTER?

T. RUSBATCH, OATLEY

It is possible, and the winter views of the Himalayas from Uttarakhand are sensational, but expect
temperatures to fall below zero in Almora. There are several guesthouses and small resorts along
Binsar Road, Deenapani, just outside Almora. The pick of the bunch is Kalmatia Sangam
(kalmatia-sangam.com), which has wood fires in its cottages. From here you could do day walks down
the terraced hills into the valleys.

If you have a week to spare and are feeling intrepid, you could travel in a circular route north from
Almora to Kausani, then to Karnaprayag, Srinagar, south to Rishikesh, then return to Delhi. This route
would take you close to the peaks along the border with Tibet and close to some of India's holiest
pilgrimage sites. Consider hiring a minivan with a driver.

As a frost-free alternative, February is an ideal time to explore Rajasthan, one of the most sensational
and colourful parts of India. The high points would be Ajmer, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaisalmer.

HOPE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ON A FAMILY HOLIDAY. WE ARE 10
ADULTS AND SEVEN CHILDREN FROM TWO TO 12, WE'VE ALREADY BEEN TO FIJI AND NEW
ZEALAND AND WE WOULD LIKE SOMEWHERE NOT TOO FAR WITH SOME SORT OF CULTURAL
EXPERIENCE. I LIKE BALI BUT THE OTHERS ARE WARY OF TAKING THE YOUNGER CHILDREN.
WE THOUGHT OF LORD HOWE ISLAND OR ULURU.

J. KING, PALMERS ISLAND

Is Bali right off the table? Because there are not too many places that could satisfy your needs quite like
the Island of the Gods. You could hire several villas within the same complex and have oodles of private
space, swimming pools, cooks if you want and massages in-house, and it doesn't cost a bomb.
Depending on your location you could have shopping, restaurants and cafes close at hand, and as for
culture, there are not too many people who celebrate, dance, perform and pray quite like the Balinese.

Some of your extended family might have health concerns about those young children but for sensible
and careful parents Bali is a low-risk destination.

Lord Howe Island is flagrantly gorgeous and it's well equipped for adventure despite its modest size, but
it's hardly a cultural experience. I'm not certain that Uluru would offer the variety that you might want to
please everyone.

Melanesian culture is more subdued than that of Asia.

MY HUSBAND AND I ARE GOING TO VISIT OUR SON WHO IS STUDYING AND PLAYING SPORT
IN SKAGIT VALLEY, WASHINGTON STATE, USA. WE ARE HOPING TO CATCH A FEW OF HIS
GAMES AS WELL AS ENJOY SOME SIGHTSEEING. CAN YOU RECOMMEND A WEEK'S WORTH
OF DAY TRIPS IN AND AROUND THE AREA SO WE CAN EXPLORE BUT WATCH HIM PLAY IN
THE AFTERNOON?
M. HARVIS, MARYLAND

The problem is that Skagit Valley is in a wilderness area in the north of the state close to the Canadian
border. This is a majestic region, but most of the activities there take more time than the five or six hours
you would have available if you also want to see your son's games. To the east are the postcard-perfect
mountains, lakes and forests of North Cascades National Park, but you need time to experience them.
To the west is Anacortes, gateway to the maritime wonderland of the San Juan Islands - again, time
required. It would be a great shame to miss out on the opportunities to experience some really
remarkable parts of the west coast that your visit presents.

It might be possible to tailor your visit so you can satisfy both objectives, but not if you confine
yourselves to staying in the vicinity of Skagit Valley. Along with the two areas already mentioned,
Seattle, Vancouver and Vancouver Island are all worth a visit.

CONVERSATION

OVER TO YOU ...

THE QUESTION WAS "PICNIC LUNCHES OR GREAT TRAVEL PASSES - GOT A MONEY-SAVER
TIP YOU'D LIKE TO PASS ON?"
From H. and G. Chirgwin, "My wife and I travelled in China in September/October last year. We saved a
lot of money by organising our own tour guides in each city and travelling between cities by rail. Where
feasible, we travelled by public transport within each city. This was more personalised, at a slower pace
and a much more immersive experience than the large group tours, and also at a significantly lower
cost."

K. Phillips writes "When I told my friends that I was planning to spend three weeks in Europe without my
partner but with my 21-year-old daughter and her boyfriend, most were convinced it would cost a
fortune. How wrong they were. In Amsterdam we stayed in a lovely two-bedroom apartment at the heart
of the city courtesy of a house swap. We did the same thing in Berlin and Stockholm. We paid nothing
for accommodation for three weeks staying in some of the most fascinating cities in Europe. And
because we were in family homes we had all the benefits of home. There are so many advantages: you
buy fresh food to make your own cheap healthy snacks. Wine and beer from the supermarkets instead
of exorbitant prices in bars. You avoid all the hidden costs of staying in a hotel like surcharges for Wi-Fi.
And you live like a local."

Next question: Ever tried to learn a foreign language to enhance your holiday experience, and what was
the result - informative, funny or just plain embarrassing?
