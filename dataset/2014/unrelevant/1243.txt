A developer with links to mainland China has acquired a two-storey office building on La Trobe Street
in the Melbourne central business district for $10 million.

The price represented a land value of $9882 a square metre, demonstrating the continued strong
appetite for Melbourne CBD sites with future residential redevelopment potential.

The building at 488 La Trobe Street stands on a 1012-square-metre site and has the potential to be
redeveloped into high-rise apartments or a hotel. It sold without a planning permit.
The fully leased property brings in current annual net income of about $385,950. It sold on a passing
yield of 3.85 per cent.

The deal included a demolitions clauses in place providing the buyer with the ability to break the
current lease terms to redevelop the property.

The vendors, Jennifer and Kevin Winward, own and run engineering consultancy Winward Structures
from the site.
The Winwards acquired the property for $3.16 million in October 2003 and benefited strongly from
accelerating Melbourne CBD land values. The $10 million sale price equated to a compound annual
growth rate of almost 11 per cent.
It sold four weeks before the close of an expressions of interest campaign handled by Clinton Baxter
and Nick Peden of Savills, alongside Alasdair MacGillivray of Bayley Stuart. "The property was sold
on an unconditional basis, with numerous offers having been made from a wide range of buyers,
including local developers plus buyers based in Malaysia, Singapore and China," Mr Baxter said.
In early May, a Singapore-based investment company paid $15 million for a three-level car park at
399 Lonsdale Street with approval for a 39-level residential tower. The sale price equated to a rate
of $17,600 a square metre.
Dan Magree, director of research firm m3property, said demand had pushed up land rates from
$6000 a square metre to as high as $18,000 a square metre.
