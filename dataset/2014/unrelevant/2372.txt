A bigger than expected trade surplus and news Australia's largest trading partner, China, is
implementing new stimulus measures lifted shares.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index added 6.6 points, or 0.1 per cent, on Thursday to 5409.9 after
taking a strong lead from the United States where the S&P 500 closed at another record high.

Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows retail sales grew for the fourth month in a row, up 0.2 per
cent seasonally adjusted in February.

The result was a touch below consensus forecasts for a 0.3 per cent rise.

The softer than predicted result was nothing to worry about given it followed a 1.2 per cent spike in
January, Barclays Australia chief economist Kieran Davies said.
Another ABS report shows the trade balance posted a surplus of $1.2 billion in February, well above
median expectations for a surplus of $800 million. It was the third month in a row of surplus after a
22-month stretch of deficits.

Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan noted a lift in commodity export volumes offset a decline
in commodity prices, which fell 0.7 per cent in US dollar terms.
"Yet another month of better than expected trade data is a sign that despite the wind-down in
Australia's mining boom, its legacy is translating into a new phase of resources production and
exports," Credit Suisse Private Banking Australia chief investment strategist David McDonald said.
Resources giant BHP Billiton rose 0.4 per cent to $37.53 amid speculation the company could
embark on a massive program of divesting non-core assets. Junior miner Cassini Resources
skyrocketed 366.7 per cent to 21¢ on the news it bought BHP Billiton's West Musgrave project for
$10 million.
BHP's main rival, Rio Tinto, dipped 0.7 per cent to $63.68 as the spot price for iron ore, landed in
China, fell 2 per cent to $US115.30 a tonne.
China's State Council announced plans to spend more on railways and housing for low-income
earners and provide tax relief for small business as part of a new stimulus package designed to
ensure the government would meet its 7.5 per cent annual growth target this year.

The Markit/HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 51.9 in March from February's
51.0.
"Troubles in China's shadow banking sector and financial industry are cause for concern in the short
term but it is important to remember that commodity demand is still likely to grow, just at a slower
pace," Mr McDonald said.

Goodman Fielder's stock to 51¢ as UBS analyst Craig Stafford upgraded his recommendation from
neutral to buy because of a dramatic price change.

The packaged food wholesaler bounced on Thursday after dumping 22 1 per cent of its market value
on Wednesday after the company slashed its full-year profit guidance by $27 million.

Among the biggest supermarket operators, Woolworths lifted 0.6 per cent to $35.89, while
Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, added 0.8 per cent to $41.66.

National Australia Bank lost 0.5 per cent to $35.37 after the unexpected announcement chief
executive Cameron Clyne will retire in August to be replaced by NAB's head of New Zealand,
Andrew Thorburn.

The rest of the big four banks were mixed. Commonwealth Bank of Australia added 0.1 per cent to
$77.03, Westpac Banking Corporation fell 0.4 per cent to $34.47 and ANZ Banking Group rose
0.3 per cent to $33.21.

Telstra Corporation lifted 0.6 per cent to $5.09, despite reports regulatory delays could push back an
expected move by the telecommunications giant to boost dividends. Telstra is waiting on approvals
from Hong Kong's competition regulator over the proposed sale of its stake in Asian mobile provider
CSL, which is part of a $2.6 billion deal.

Childcare network G8 Education was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200, down 4 per cent to
20¢. Analysts are in the process of re-rating the stock which has climbed in recent weeks after a
major acquisition.

Information technology was the worst-performing sector, down 0.4 per cent, as IRESS dipped 1.7 per
cent after Eva Dimensions analyst Andrew Zamfotis put a sell call on the financial markets software
group.
