SYDNEY-- Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. rejected a 3.05 billion Australian dollar (US$2.85 billion)
takeover bid from KKR & Co. L.P., pitched as the world's No. 2 vintner grapples with a string of setbacks
including poor U.S. sales that forced it destroy thousands of gallons of wine last year.
The U.S. private-equity firm offered A$4.70 per Treasury Wine share, representing a 15% premium to
their closing price Monday of A$4.07.

News of the bid sent shares in Treasury Wine--the maker of vintages ranging from the mass-market
Beringer brand to the prestigious Penfolds Grange--up 19% and above the offer price, indicating
investors think KKR may return with a higher offer.
"KKR is looking to split it up, clean up the U.S. business for an eventual trade buyer, who can benefit
from synergies," said Will Seddon, a portfolio manager at Sydney-based White Funds Management,
which owns Treasury Wine shares. "There's a lot of debate about what the company is worth, but in our
view the stock isn't cheap, so the offer price isn't a lowball number."
"KKR has no immediate comment on the matter," a Singapore-based spokesman for the company said
in an-emailed statement.
KKR's bid was made April 16 and had been kept confidential until Tuesday, when Treasury Wine
decided to make it public after learning that KKR had approached some of its shareholders, risking a
breach of confidentiality.
Seeking to arrest a fall in its share price over the past year, Treasury Wine in March appointed former
food executive Michael Clarke as its new chief executive. Mr. Clarke, who once steered Kraft Food
Group Inc.'s European business and has held senior positions at Coca-Cola Co., wants to turn the
company around by focusing on its most profitable brands and slashing corporate overheads. A
company spokesman said Tuesday the company intends to cut around 5% of staff, equating to about
175 positions.
"The board has considered the KKR proposal in the context of these renewed plans and concluded that
the proposal does not reflect the fundamental value of the company," Treasury Wine said Tuesday.
The Melbourne-based company took a write-down of 155 million Australian dollars (US$144 million)
last year largely because of its problems in the U.S. The wine destruction, which involved crushing
bottles with steamrollers, contributed to the departure of former CEO David Dearie in September.
Since then, the company has contended with further setbacks. An attempt to raise prices in Australia
before the holiday season hurt sales. In China, demand for Treasury Wine's bottles has been dented by
an economic slowdown and as Beijing clamps down on extravagant gift-giving among businesses and
government officials as part of an anticorruption drive.

create a new company for premium assets such as Penfolds that could be listed on the Australian
Securities Exchange.
