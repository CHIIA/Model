The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close lower today.

Markets closed down in Europe, the UK and US last night.

On the NYSE where 3252 issues traded there were 1,328 issues higher, 1,787 down and 137 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2813 issues traded there were 920 issues higher, 1,770 down and 123 unchanged.
Metals were weaker, crude was mixed, gold rose. The $A is at 93.56US c, unchanged from last evening.

"Down another 20 points today"

"Maree said, "Our market will finish the week with a fall in the ASX200 as world stock markets react to
escalating Ukraine/Russian tensions rather than improved growth in the USA.
"China's property market however remains the biggest concern for Australia's economic prosperity with
only 2 out of the 70 Chinese cities reporting a price rise compared with 62 out of 70 this time last year.
The Chinese have major investors in the Australian property market and we may see repatriation of
Chinese funds from Australia as they shore up losses in their own property market. This would certainly
stress the Australian property market with prices falling and the effect ripping through the whole economy.
"Together with falling iron ore prices impacting our export receipts and unemployment at 12 year highs,
the economy may be entering very turbulent times.

"I expect our market closes down another 20 points today".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 26.8 points to 5624.4 last evening.

August 29. Good morning.

In the Ukraine Nato releases satellite images which it says show Russian forces inside Ukraine to help
rebels fight government troops - a claim Russia denies (more below in other news). The escalation of
strife in the Ukraine saw markets turn down last night.

Trading points:

*CGH: NPAT up 10.1%, 2.5c ff div, DRP at no disc/outlook update at AGM
Calibre Group Ltd for the year ended June 30 announced a net profit up 10.1% to $24.426 million on
revenue down 0.3% to $709.268 million.

A final 2.5c fully franked dividend was announced. Ex date is September 10, record date September 12.
The DRP is available at no discount.

NTA backing per security is 10c vs 1c last year.

EPS 7.6c up 4.1%.
Calibre's strong operating cash flows delivered closing cash of $46.4 million and resulted in a net cash
position of $2.8 million vs a net debt position of $23 million for the pcp.

Calibre provides its services through three key segments - infrastructure, consulting and resources.

Revenues increased following a full eyar contribution from G&S Engineering vs 9 months for the previous
full year, driven by two major projects, the Hay Point Coal terminal onshore upgrade project and the Caval
Ridge project for BHP Mitsubishi Alliance.
Consulting revenues rose 22.9% to $68.6 million.
Resources revenue fell 36.7% to $312 million, affected by completion of a number of large scale projects
and continued tight market conditions.

Outlook

Calibre expects a stronger skew to revenue and earning in the 2nd half compared to previous years. An
update will be provided at the AGM.

Analysts expectations: $32.9 mln (Aug 28)
*EQT: NPAT up 12%, 48c ff div, DRP at 2.5% disc/acquisition highly successful
Equity Trustees Ltd for the year ended June 30 announced a net profit after tax up 12% to $9.713 million
on revenue up 15.7% to $54.935 million.

A 48c fully franked dividend was announced, record date September 18. The DRP is available at a 2.5%
discount.

NTA backing per security is $9.5 vs $1.89 last year.

EPS is 88.64c vs 87.58c last year.
The material increase in NTA followed the settlement of the acquisition of Equity Trustees Wealth
Services Ltd (ETWSL) (formerly ANZ Trustees Ltd) on July 4. If the capital raising were notionally
excluded, the NTA backing per share would be $2.22.

Chairman Tony Killen said in the report the increase in operating result reflected organic growth in both
EQT's main revenue business units.

Managing director Robin Burns said integraton is still in early stages, but the business is a very close fit
with EQT's long term strategic plan. There is also a 5 year referral agreement in place with the ANZ bank.
Equity Trustees has almost doubled its market cap with the acquisition, the chairman noted. In addition
the number of shareholders increased 30% to approximately 2,400 and institutional representation on the
register has grown materially. (Aug 28)

*REX: NPAT down 44.9%, no div, balance sheet strong, confident outlook

Basic and diluted eps is 7c vs 12.8c last year.

NTA backing per security is $1.64 vs $1.57 last year.

Executive chairman Lim Kim Hai in his Annual Report said it would be an understatement to say that
Australian aviation is in crisis. Both the Qantas and Virgin Australia groups are losing money at a rate that
would see their net tangible assets wiped our in three years or less unless they manage to recapitalise.
The situation is much worse in the regional aviation sector. In the last nine months alone, three more
names have been added to the graveyard of Australian regional carriers since September 2011.

He chronicled 16 regional airlines that have closed their doors since 2004, with Vincent Aviation the most
recent closure, this year.

He said Rex is the only listed passenger airline left that is making a profit, "and as long as we continue to
do so, we have the capability to ride out this crisis .. when the inevitable recovery takes place Rex will be
there, stronger and better prepared than ever". (Aug 28)

(FFI Holdings has been profitable and paid a dividend since listing in January 1987 on the Second Board).

Analysts expectations: $203.4 mln/$201.4 mln/$192 mln.

franchisee health. HVN is exposed to more difficult markets compared to other discretionary retailers,
valuaton remains supportive. The broker's price target is $3.68.

*TAP: Gross profit $6.9m before writedowns, no div/1st prod late 3rd qtr

At close the cash balance was $17.846 million vs $43.5 million at end December.

Page90of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Managing director Troy Hayden said in the report the first half was a solid period with a number of
highlights including a major refinancing deal with BNP and the ongoing advancement towards the
commissioning of Tap's flagship Manora Project, scheduled for first production late in the third quarter of
2014.

"TAP is set to emerge as a mid tier producer, generating substantial net cash flows in the short term,
against a company backdrop that is strong financially and operationally".

Analysts expectations: Neg $800,000.
*Oil & Gas Weekly in its issue dated July 13 said TAP is looking for first production from the Manora oil
field in late September, that will return TAP, with a 30% interest in Manora, which is estimated to have
31.1 million barrels of recoverable reserves, to producer status.

Barring any unforeseen problems with the upcoming development drilling program, Tap is fully funded for
its share of the development cost of Manora.

TAP is expected to repay the 4 year borrowing base debt facility with BNP Paribas for up to $US90
million, executed in April this year, within the first thirtysix months of the start of production. (Aug 28)

*TCQ: Transmetro reports for the year.
Company guidance: On August 7 Trinity Ltd in guidance for the year ended June 30 announced it expects
a net profit of $400,000/500,000 vs a loss of $4.4 million last year on total comprehensive income of
$400,000.

Comparatively the group's 2013 financial year loss included a $4 millon expense relating to a net
writedown and loss on disposal of a significant portion of TCQ's investment in assets at the Cumberland
Lorne Resort in Lorne, Victoria.

Results will be announced on August 29.

*TSE: Transfield Services reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $62.6 mln.

On July 10 a leading broker retained an "underweight" on Traansfield Services following TSE's
announcement that it has been awarded a contract to manage Australian Defence facilities across WA,
NT, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia for six years with a four yera option at $270 million per
annum, $140 m of which is incremental to TSE's existing Defence revenue.

The broker added, "In our view attention is now likely to turn to (1) TSE's tenuous fiscal position and (2)
Easternwell's ongoing growth delays. The broker's target price is $1.

*VAH: Virgin Australia reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $165.1 mln/Neg $167.1 mln/Neg $171.3mln

*On August 8 a leading broker retained a "reduce" on Virgin Australia, expecting its largest loss ever. The
broker said the domestic capacity battle between VAH and QAN has taken its toll on both carriers. With
VAH continuing to trade above what the broker believes to be fair fundamental valuation levels, it
reiterates its Reduce. The broker added its full year 2014 normalised eps forecast declines from negative
5.2c to negative 5.9c as it factors in larger Tigerair Australia losses recorded in the 4th quarter. The broker
expects VAH to trade down to more fundamental valuations in the next 12 months.

*On July 16 a leading broker lowered its rating on Virgin to 'sell" from "neutral with a price target of 35c vs
36c previously.
The broker said it expects unrestricted cash will fall slightly in the 2nd half to $550 million. However given
Virgin's strategic shareholders continue to increase their ownership in the airline (now collectively
accounting for 78% of shars on issue) the broker expects Virgin's funding position to be well supported in
the event of any liquidity drain.

*On July 8 a leading broker retained an "underweight" for Virgin and a 34c price target, saying it remains
33% below full year 2015 consensus EBITDA. Although VAH is taking domestic share from QAN, the
broker said it questions the cost at which this is being achieved. The broker sees another equity raising
as a key risk.

*WOW: Woolworths reports for the year.

Page91of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Analysts expectations: $2.442 bln/$2.502 bln/$2.454.7 bln/$2.444.8 bln/$2.433.6 bln.

*A leading broker on August 15 retained a "buy" on Woolworths with a $39.20 price target after
Woolworths reported its Home Improvement venture will not break even but will lose $169 million of
EBIT, worse than prior guidance for losses no greater than the $139 million it lost last year.

The broker said after a tour of the new format Masters stores with MD Matt Tyson the broker said some
sensible changes were being made to the Masters Store format, ranging from improving the offer in
categories that drive traffic such as hardware, trade and garden, price perception - improving the value to
the market to emphasise Masters prices are on par with other big box retailers including Bunnings, and
making the store easier to navigate.

The broker said earlier not much has gone right for Masters, sales have been below expectations, GM's
have been softer and costs have been higher. The broker added it was not new news - itself and the
market had expected guidance to be downgraded.

The broker left its valuation unchanged at $37.03 and its price target at $39.20.

*A leading broker on August 12 retained a "buy" on Woolworths while lowering its price target to $37.65
from $38.09.

The broker said the home improvement miss was disappointing, but already factored in by the market.
Momentum in Australian food and liquor division is improving and closing the sales growth gap to Coles.
Further CODB savings will support EBIT margin expansion.

*Another leading broker on August 12 retained an "underweight" on Woolworths and a price target of $31.
The broker said the Masters warning equates to $35 million (WOW share $23 million) or 0.6% of WOW
group EBIT. Guidance has been re-affirmed, despite the weaker than expected performance which implies
that other divisions, probably Food & Liquor has again picked up the slack. "Given the weaker Home
Improvement outlook, we see increasing risk to 2015 profit guidance" the broker added.

*Another leading broker retained a 'sell" on Woolworths on August 12 with a price target of $32.14. the
broker said of concern is that WOW's average annualised sales per store at Masters has declined in five
of the last six quarters and currently sits some 10% below the level one year earlier.
Company guidance: On August 12 Woolworths Ltd in an update on its Home Improvement business said
the losses on its Home Improvements business will exceed the losses in 2013, and is not expected to
break even in 2016. WOW remains confident Home Improvement will become a material profit contributor
for Woolworths and the rationale for entering the market remains compelling.
So far 49 Masters stores have been opened with Home Improvement sales of more than $1.5 billion in
2014.

Lowe's has amended the terms of their put option and remains supportive.

Woolworths has recruited Matt Tyson, an outstanding home improvement retailer who said in the report
the next stage of development will include a refocussed store rollout plan and an enhanced store format
and range.

Total Home Improvements sales, including Masters and Home Timber and Hardware rose 23.2% or
25.7% normalised to $1.527 billion from 2013.
Total EBIT was negative $169 million, down 24.1% on negative $138.9 million in 2013.

Woolworths expects to open fewer new stores in the next two years and will not deliver on the previously
forecast target of 90 stores by the end of financial year 2016. Around 10/15 Masters stores will be opened
per year for the next few years.

weapons are in eastern Ukraine. "We've found that "large quantities of advanced weapons, including air
defense systems, tanks and armored vehicles were handed over to the separatists in eastern Ukraine,"
one NATO general told the Belgian Mons. Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on the evening, the
European Union will advise the Summit on Saturday in Brussels on further sanctions against Russia.

"We want diplomatic solutions' Merkel said. "But we have to realize that things have complicated and

The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko has issued contradictory messages. Despite massive
allegations of Kiev of a Russian military offensive in eastern Ukraine, Poroshenko said his country will
organize joint patrols with Russian colleagues in the East. This had been discussed with Russian
President Vladimir Putin at the recent meeting in Minsk.

NATO published in Mons satellite images to prove their assessment. For weeks the Ukraine accuses the
neighbors to intervene militarily in the conflict. This had always been denied by Moscow. Russia is not
interested in sending troops, the Russian OSCE Representative Andrei Kelin said in Vienna.

clothing, and all their clothes, bedclothes, mattresses etc must be burnt. The disease spreads from bodily
fluids. The virus is thought to have spread from a single funeral - for a native healer.
