LONDON--Educational computing products group RM PLC (RM.LN) said Wednesday trading in the
third quarter has been ahead of expectations helped by lower than expected costs and it now expects a
"significantly" more profitable second half than anticipated at the time of half year results.

Shares at 1115 up 19.5 pence, or 16%, at 141.5 pence.

Newspaper and business publications group DAILY MAIL & GENERAL TRUST PLC (DMGT.LN) said
its adjusted operating profit for the current financial year in one of its divisions will be at the bottom end
of market expectations after further delays with its new risk management software product.

Shares down 52 pence, or 6.38%, at 762.5 pence.

Retailer JD SPORTS FASHION PLC (JD.LN) raised its interim dividend by 3% after reporting a
significant jump in pretax profit for the first six months of the year, amid a strong performance in its
sports and outdoor division.

Shares up 27 pence, or 6.62%, at 435 pence.
African nickel and copper miner BELLZONE MINING PLC (BZM.LN) is still in loan talks with China
Sonangol International as well as other potential providers of longer term financing, as it warned that it
only has funding to continue operations until mid-September.

Shares down 0.14 pence, or 20%, at 0.55 pence.

Billing technology group BILLING SERVICES GROUP LTD. (BILL.LN) swung to a first-half pretax profit
but lowered its full-year revenue guidance as it continues to be affected by the decline in landline phone
billing. It expects full-year revenue to be $42.0 million to $45.0 million, modestly below levels
projected in prior guidance.

Shares down 0.12 pence, or 3.85%, at 3.13 pence.

Stock broker CENKOS SECURITIES PLC (CNKS.LN) reported an eight-fold rise in first-half pretax
profit to 23.5 million pounds ($38.1 million), amid economic recovery in the U.K. and strong equity
market trading conditions. Revenue rose to GBP65.2 million, from GBP20.0 million.

Shares up 29 pence, or 13%, at 245 pence.

FTSE Small-Cap up 0.16%

AIM down 0.13%
