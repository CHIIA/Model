CLOSES MILDLY HIGHER/VOLUME UP AHEAD OF SPI SETTLEMENT TOMORROW

Our market closed up 11 points to 5355.6 almost exactly as expected, with the banks back in favor and
miners taking a back seat as macro news (Russia and the Ukraine, the US FOMC, China's possibly
escalating property defaults) dominated Asian markets.
Meanwhile volume on our market was a handsome $5.2 billion - up from $4.6 billion on match out
ahead of the SPI Futures March series close off on market opening tomorrow when June becomes the
live quarter.

The $A is at 91.14US c, up about 30 points from last evening.

*Wotif shot up 56c to $3 on 14.1m shares - responded to the ASX price query by saying it is conducting
investor meetings this week.

*Newcrest rose 29c to $11.52 on 5.8m shares, perhaps more to do with portfolio adjustment for the
quarter than tepid gold price today.

*David Jones fell 1c to $3.32 on 3.7m shares after its interim result today.

*Myer, reporting tomorrow, is up 1c to $2.66 on 5.25m shares.
*Stockland fell 10c to $3.75 on 28.5 million shares after acquiring a strategic stake in Australand.
*Intrepid is down 1c to 25c on 1.1m shares - will receive $US80 million in settlement for the termination
of its interests in Tujuh Bukit, and will seek shareholder vote on the favored course for its total $US160
million cash balance.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was up 40 points to 14,380 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
down 32 points to 21,523 points, S&P futures was down 0.4 points to 1863.4, Nasdaq futures was up 1.5
points to 3696.5, Dow futures was 2 points higher at 16,264 points. Gold futures were down $1.40 to
$1357.60. Crude futures were down 21c to $99.49.
