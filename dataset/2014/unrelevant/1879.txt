Chinese property giant Country Garden sold more than a third of its $500 million Ryde Garden
residential project at a launch on Saturday.
The developer sold 296 apartments – 90 per cent of the stock it put up for sale – in six hours.

The company hasn't said when it will release the final tranche of apartments.
The development, on a 17,585-square-metre site in Delhi Road, North Ryde, is due for completion in
late 2017.

It will contain 830 apartments.
Prices started at $488,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. Five penthouses were sold for prices
ranging between $1.3 million and $1.7 million.
Buyers queued at the Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney an hour before sales began. They were able to
sign contracts on the spot, with deposits payable in the next few days.
"Up to 20 per cent of the buyers were former Country Garden customers," the company's general
manager, sales and marketing, Nicholas Hum, said.

Most of the buyers were local, a spokeswoman said.
"As our first foray into property investment, we're really happy to be able to find a property in not
only a great location but what we believe is good value for money," said Georges Hall resident Carol
Pakula, who bought a one-bedroom apartment.

The sales came a day after a parliamentary committee met to discuss foreign investment in real
estate. Reserve Bank of Australia assistant governor Christopher Kent told the committee that
arduous planning processes and local residents resisting higher-density buildings were to blame for
an undersupply of housing, not foreign buyers.
