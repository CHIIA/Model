LONDON, ENGLAND and NEW YORK, AMERICA and SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE--(Marketwired -
Nov. 26, 2014) -
Tullett Prebon plc (the "Company") today announced that it
has completed the acquisition of PVM Oil Associates Limited, a leading
independent oil brokerage firm, and its subsidiaries ("PVM").
PVM has an average daily turnover in excess of 150 million barrels of Over the
Counter (OTC) oil derivatives including options and oil futures contracts. The
firm employs 130 specialist brokers headquartered in London, Singapore and in
Hoboken and Houston in the USA.
The PVM transaction adds 33 new broking desks to the Tullett Prebon Group and
significantly increases coverage of oil products in Asia and the US markets.
PVM's Information Sales business is focussed on the oil sector and complements
Tullett Prebon's information sales business, Tullett Prebon Information, which
has 1,300 subscriber firms in 50 countries.
PVM's main broking activities relate to Crude Oil and Petroleum Products. The
transaction also adds a global oil futures business, biomass, Singapore
distillates and Urals to the Tullett Prebon group. Over the last year PVM has
also started environmental activities covering biomass and biofuels. It has
also started the physical and financial broking of coal and the physical
options broking of EU Carbon allowances and offsets. PVM is also active in
energy related shipping.
PVM has more than 350 brokerage customers, some of whom have traded with the
firm for over 30 years. They include commodity producers and consumers,
traders and risk managers within large oil and gas corporations, energy
utilities, fund managers, professional traders, hedge funds and financial
institutions. More than 80 per cent of PVM's sales in 2013 originated from
non-investment bank clients. In the latest audited accounts, for the year
ended 31 July 2013, PVM reported revenue of USD107.5m (GBP 68.5m at current
exchange rates). The unaudited management accounts for the 12 months to July
2014 show revenue of USD114.2m (GBP 72.7m at current exchange rates).
By combining the Tullett Prebon and PVM energy data sets, Tullett Prebon
Information, a leading provider of independent real-time price information
from the global OTC financial and commodity markets, will be able to expand
its suite of energy products to extend and deepen its global crude, refined
and middle distillates coverage. Additionally a range of new datasets
including CFDs, EFPs, EFSs and pricing for the Urals will be available.
Further areas of product expansion are envisaged including US domestic crudes.
John Phizackerley, CEO of Tullett Prebon, said, "The combination of Tullett
Prebon and PVM firmly establishes our leading position in the oil broking

client base, as well as allowing Tullett Prebon Information to expand its data
offering to a broader set of customers. Tullett Prebon and PVM are highly
complementary and we look forward to developing the business together for the
benefit of our clients."
David Hufton, CEO of PVM, said, "In Tullett Prebon, we have found an ideal
partner for PVM. Together we will be able to expand and enhance our valuable
franchise, reach more customers and provide an even better quality of
execution."
