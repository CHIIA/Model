18 Mar 2014 22:18 EDT *CapitaLand: Sold Australand Shares via Secondary Placement
19 Mar 2014 00:44 EDT CapitaLand Sells Australand Property Stake for $767 Million

By P.R. Venkat and Ross Kelly
CapitaLand Ltd. has sold its entire stake in an Australian residential and commercial property
developer for US$767 million, as the Singaporean property developer focuses on its core domestic and
China market.
Southeast Asia's largest property developer by market value is completely exiting Australand Property
Group. Australand, which has a market capitalization of 2.3 billion Australian dollars (US$2.1 billion),
develops and owns properties mostly in Australia's largest cities--Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Its
tenants include Australia's largest bank by market value, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd., and
Australia's largest airline, Qantas Airways Ltd.

"We have decided to divest our remaining stake in Australand now as market conditions are favorable
and Australand's share price has performed strongly in the past few months. This divestment would
allow us to reallocate capital to our core businesses in Singapore and China," Lim Ming Yan, President
& Group chief executive, CapitaLand said in a statement Wednesday.
CapitaLand, which is 39% owned by state investment firmTemasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., has been looking
to exit from AustraLand for over a year. Both Capitaland and Australand sought potential buyers in
January 2013, but concluded the effort in July after failing to receive proposals deemed to be "superior
to business as usual." Among the bidders, GPT Group withdrew its proposal to buy Australand's
commercial and industrial assets in May, while Mirvac Group Ltd. appointed an adviser to consider a
potential takeover of Australand. But that deal was never announced. In November last year, the
Singapore developer first sold a 20% stake through a placement that fetched A$434 million.

CapitaLand is selling its entire 39.1% stake, or 226.2 million securities of Australand at an average price
of A$3.75 per security in a secondary placement, which is a 3.6% discount to Australand's closing price
of A$3.89 on Tuesday. Shares of Australand have gained 15% in the last 12 months, outperforming the
benchmark S&P/ASX200 index, which has gained 7% over the same period.
In a separate filing, Stockland, another Australian property developer, said that it has acquired 20% of
Australand through the placement for around A$435.3 million. Mark Steinert, the chief executive of
Stockland, said that "over time this holding will enable us to explore strategic opportunities with
Australand." Stockland is a diversified property developer and manager with assets including shopping
malls, residential housing communities and retirement villages.

"Ultimately, we believe Stockland will look to undertake a full takeover of Australand, which suggests a
meaningful equity raising to fund the deal," analysts at Macquarie Group in Sydney said in a client note.

CapitaLand intends to use the proceeds of the deal to explore opportunities in its two core markets and
repay some debt. At its fourth-quarter earnings results briefing last month, CapitaLand said that it
believed that the long-term demand for homes, shopping malls and offices in Singapore remained
positive and that the group was optimistic about its prospects in China. CapitaLand's China unit is

residential property. Earlier this year, the developer paid US$181 million to buy a residential site in a
government tender in the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo with plans to build 1,100
small-and-medium-size residential units.
CapitaLand's real estate portfolio primarily includes homes, offices, shopping malls, and serviced
residences. The listed entities of the CapitaLandGroup include, CapitaMalls Asia, Ascott Residence
Trust, CapitaCommercial Trust, CapitaMall Trust, CapitaMalls Malaysia Trust and CapitaRetail China
Trust.
