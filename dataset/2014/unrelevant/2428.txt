BMI View: The fragmented nature of the Asia Pacific region will continue to provide unequal
commercial opportunities for pharmaceutical firms looking to invest in the region. Key drivers of
growth in the region include ageing populations across many Asia Pacific countries, an expanding
and increasingly affluent middle - class and various governments' commitment to improv ing
healthcare access.

The Asia Pacific regional pharmaceutical market is expanding rapidly due to a rising, affluent,
middle-class, and governments' push for healthcare reforms. Combined sales of prescription
drugs and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are forecast to increase from USD276.6bn in 2013 to
USD384.7bn in 2018, representing a five-year compound annual growth (CAGR) of 7.0%. It is
worth noting that by 2018, overall pharmaceutical sales in Asia Pacific is expected to exceed
overall drug sales in Western Europe and the US combined. The sub-region of Greater China
consisting of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (+11.7% CAGR) will expand fastest,
followed by South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (+10.5%)), South East Asia
(Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam (+9.4%))
and Developed Asia Pacific: Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan (+2.3%).
