Australian energy infrastructure business APA Group said Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire the
Queensland Curtis LNG pipeline from British energy companyBG Group PLC for USD5 billion, or
AUD6.05 billion.
APA Group, which owns and operates in excess of USD12 billion of energy assets, noted that
QCNLG pipeline links gas fields in the Surat Basin to the QCLNG projects LNG plant on Curtis Island.
The pipeline is a key component of the QCLNG project.

Mick McCormack, Managing Director of APA Group said, The acquisition of the QCLNG pipeline
further enhances APAs position as Australias largest owner of gas transmission pipelines and builds on
APAs strategy of expanding its revenue base and east coast grid.

The QCLNG Project is an integrated project to convert gas to LNG and will convert gas supplied from
the Surat Basin to LNG at facilities located on Curtis Island. The project comprises two QCLNG trains
with a combined nameplate capacity of 8.5 mtpa.

Under gas transportation agreements, the pipeline revenues are fully contracted with BG Group
companies and an entity owned by China National Offshore Oil Corp. or CNOOC on a 20-year
take-or-pay basis. The primary tariff components are escalated at US CPI.
APA Group plans to raise AUD1.84 billion through a fully underwritten pro-rata accelerated entitlement
offer to partly fund the acquisition. The company will fund the balance of the amount through a
USD4.10 billion syndicated bank bridge facility.

The transaction is expected to close in early second quarter of 2015. For the first full financial year
ending June 30, 2016, the pipeline is expected to contribute additional EBITDA of USD383 million and
additional operational cash flow of about USD200 million to USD221 million.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, APA Group reaffirmed its stand-alone, pre-acquisition financial
guidance. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, the company expects statutory earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA in a range of AUD1.17 billion to AUD1.19
billion. This is inclusive of the accounting gain on the sale of APAs holding in Envestra.
