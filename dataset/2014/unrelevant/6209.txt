Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. swung to a loss in the third quarter, dragged down by a $6 billion
write-down related largely to its purchase of a Canadian iron ore mine as well as lower iron ore and
metallurgical coal prices.
The Cleveland-based iron ore and coal miner--the largest iron-ore miner in the U.S. that in April was
removed from the S&P 500--has said it intends to sell its less profitable mining operations and focus on
its Minnesota and Michigan mines, which supply iron ore to booming automotive-focused steel mills.

Iron ore is the main ingredient in the making of steel, and Cliffs' U.S. mines have benefited from the
resurgence of the Detroit auto industry and drill-pipe demand for natural-gas wells in North America.
The hefty write-off comes as iron ore markets have been rocked this year. The big three miners--BHP
Billion and Rio Tinto Ltd. in Australia, and Vale SA of Brazil that collectively produce more than 60% of
global iron-ore exports--expanded production while Chinese steel output eased, resulting in a drop in
prices.
China produces about half of the world's steel and imports about two-thirds of the iron ore traded on
global markets.
Prices for metallurgical coal, the other key ingredient in steelmaking, have also fallen.
In the most recent period, Cliffs Natural said iron ore prices fell 32% and metallurgical coal 17%.
The company has a cost disadvantage compared with the big three miners. BHP, Rio Tinto and Vale
control massive mines, ports and railroads, which allows them to produce iron ore at $50 or below per
ton.
By comparison, Cliffs's costs at its Eastern Canadian operations were $81.71 per ton in the third
quarter. Cliffs expects that cost to remain in the $80 to $85 range.
For the most recent period, Cliffs reported a loss of $5.88 billion, or 38.49 cents a share, from a
year-earlier profit of $117.2 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. That figure includes preferred
stock dividends. Excluding certain items, however, Cliffs reported a profit of $33 million, or 21 cents a
share, down from $144 million, or 88 cents a share.
Revenue fell 16% to $1.3 billion.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a loss of four cents a share on revenue of $1.28
billion.

Gross margin narrowed to 9.8% from 22.5% a year earlier.

Through Monday's closing, shares were down nearly 65% for the year.
