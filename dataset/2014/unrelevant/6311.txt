Resources - Stake almost worthless

The spectacular decline of magnetite developer Gindalbie Metals has accelerated, with the
struggling miner reporting a $640 million write-down of its stake in the Karara project.

In a move that virtually removes any value for the company's stake in the magnetite project,
Gindalbie said the impairment was warranted given a lower than expected iron ore price, a higher
than expected Australian dollar, and Karara's under-performance.
Gindalbie's stake in Karara was valued at about $550 million in the company's 2013 full-year
accounts. At that time, Gindalbie owned 50 per cent of the project, but its inability to pay for its share
of development has resulted in its Chinese partner Ansteel diluting Gindalbie's stake to 47.84 per
cent.
Ansteel has an option to further dilute Gindalbie's stake to 38 per cent, and it is expected to proceed
with this soon.

Monday's re-evaluation continues the apparent slow death of Gindalbie, which was worth more than
$2 billion less than four years ago. In January 2011, Gindalbie shares were worth $1.47. On
Monday they lost another 1.1¢ to only 4.7¢. The company now has a market capitalisation of only
$70 million.

Gindalbie was hampered by cost and time blowouts on the construction of Karara, which was
designed to make a high-grade magnetite concentrate from lower-grade iron deposits near
Geraldton, Western Australia.
The company has since been gutted of most its staff, and analysts are questioning its ability to
survive for much longer.
Karara was one of two magnetite projects being developed in WA by Chinese steelmakers. The
other was the disastrous Sino Iron project, which ran billions of dollars over budget and several
years behind schedule, before finally coming into production about eight months ago.
