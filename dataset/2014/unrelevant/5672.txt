2359 GMT [Dow Jones] Aristocrat's (ALL.AU) price-to-earnigs ratio of 24 times expected earnings per
share is hard to justify, says BBY analyst Moira Daw. She reiterates her underperform rating on the
slot-machine maker after its first-half results. First-half net profit after tax rose 9.2% on year to A$57.4
million, in line with market expectations, mostly due to a lower Australian dollar and tax rate. Revenue
rose 7.6% but fell 2.2% in constant-currency terms. BBY's recent price target was A$4.30/share. ALL last
A$5.17. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DRWSJ)

2358 GMT [Dow Jones] Mitsui Fudosan (8801.TO) is set to fall following the firm's announcement after
the Tuesday TSE close that it would raise up to Y325 billion via a share offering. The deal is the biggest
such offering in Japan this year and the first for Mitsui Fudosan in more than three decades. Mitsui
Fudosan said it plans to use the proceeds from its offering to invest in office buildings and retail facilities
in Japan as well as Olympics-related projects ahead of the 2020 Tokyo games. Pre-market bid/ask
levels are at Y3,110/Y3,111 vs Tuesday's close at Y3,340 as investors factor in share base dilution.
Mitsui Fudosan said it would issue up to 100 million new shares for the offer.

2354 GMT [Dow Jones] Base metals are likely to remain supported after upbeat U.S. economic data
overnight and hopes of stimulus from the Chinese government bolstered the demand outlook. Data
Tuesday showed an improvement in U.S. consumer confidence in May and a 0.8% rise in U.S. durable
goods orders in April, bucking calls for a 0.7% drop. Analysts say expectations of a pickup in business
activity are turning many investors bullish towards industrial metals including copper. However, a
stronger USD could limit further gains as commodities priced in USD appear costlier to holders of other
currencies. LME 3-month copper ended up 0.1% Tuesday at $6,933/ton--its highest price since March
7--and aluminum closed 0.8% higher at $1,828/ton. (arpan.mukherjee@wsj.com; Twitter:

2314 GMT [Dow Jones] Tower's rating was increased to outperform from neutral by Credit Suisse
following the release of a 1H14 result that beat the investment bank's forecasts. Credit Suisse says that
the 1H14 result demonstrated a continuation of gross written premium growth of 5%; a stabilization of
reinsurance espenses; improving underlying claim ratio and a solid excess captial position; "Tower has
simplified and cleaned up its business and is now in a position to capitalize on growth opportunities in a
consolidating market." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

17:59 EDT - On the face of it, the decline in Fonterra's 2014-15 payout versus the season just ending "is
a drag on the economy over the coming year," says ANZ Bank rural economist Con Williams. However,
"that dynamic is exaggerated; the coming year's payout will still be the 4th highest on record," he says.
Fonterra is forecasting it will pay its 10,500 farmers NZ$7 per kilogram of milk solids in the season
starting June 1, versus a revised NZ$8.40 in the season just ended. While NZ$8.40 has been revised
down--taking some NZ$395M out of the economy--"it only takes a little bit of cream off the top of an
otherwise stellar season," says Williams. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)
17:47 EDT - NZD/USD gets a lift from news that Fonterra Co-operative Group forecast it will pay its
10,500 farmer shareholders NZ$7.0 per kilogram of milk solids in the season that starts June 1. While
the opening forecast is sharply lower than this season's revised forecast of NZ$8.40, ANZ Bank says "it's
at the high end" of what the market was expecting. NZD/USD last at 0.8563, from 0.8541 prior to the
announcement. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

AUD will be vulnerable, says Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer. He says the Westpac Leading
index for April and 1Q construction work done will be local drivers of the currency while the Westpac-MNI
China Consumer Sentiment for May is also a must watch. The pair is at 0.9260, unchanged from late
Tuesday in Sydney. Speizer adds the downward correction being seen in the pair could run as far as
0.9000 during the weeks ahead as weak consumer sentiment a major drag. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;

16:20 EDT - Bank of America gets a little bolder with its bearish stance against the euro, lowering its
recommended stop to $1.3745, just above the EUR/USD's 100-day moving average of 1.3739. Pair
down 0.1% at $1.3633. Firm's initial target is $1.3479, then $1.3295. Technicals suggest a break below
that paves the way to $1.3104. The bearish momentum comes as investors await the highly anticipated
ECB meeting next week, widely expected to bring at least some form of policy easing.

15:32 EDT - S&P 500 hits another intraday record, but equity markets in emerging-market economies
may offer better value. Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, notes how EM
stocks have withstood the recent geopolitical risks, which "supports the notion that, although they can be
volatile, EM equities offer some relative value in a world in which many asset classes are priced for
perfection." The PE ratio for developed countries has risen nearly 40% over the past two years, while
EMs are up 20%, he says. "While EMs are not cheap per se, they offer relative value to developed
markets, which helps explain why they have outperformed developed markets by roughly 4% so far in
May," he says. (min.zeng@wsj.com; @minzengwsj)
15:08 EDT - Ratings firm Fitch expects the credit profile of Peruvian corporates it follows to remain
relatively stable during 2014. "Liquidity positions remain robust and refinancing risk is low. Downgrades
are expected to be rare in 2014," Fitch says. "The benefits from the positive business environment are
already incorporated in the current ratings, as a result there should not be a material number of rating
upgrades," it adds. Peru's economy is expected to expand by about 5% this year.

14:56 EDT - National Bank Financial says corporate bonds in Canada have generated total returns well
above comparable federal or provincial bonds. "Obviously this is a reflection of more than the higher
yield to maturity of corporate bonds," it says, also pointing to shrinking spreads. "Although the economy
has support from accommodative monetary policies and we expect it to grow at a decent pace out to the
forecast horizon, we do not want to become complacent about the outperformance potential of corporate
bonds," NBF says. If spreads tighten too much, NBF says it would rebalance its asset mix, reducing the
corporate overweight in favor of provincials. (don.curren@wsj.com; @dbcurren)

14:49 EDT - Investors are bracing for Thursday's revisions to 1Q GDP. Consensus view calls for a 0.6%
contraction in the economy versus 0.1% gain first estimated by the Commerce Department. Joseph
LaVorgna of Deutsche Bank says not to worry. Not only do other data, including nonfarm payrolls, argue
that the economy did in fact expand last quarter, but he also has noticed "a tendency for the economy to
register its softest performance of the year in Q1," despite seasonal adjustments. In five of the last seven
years, he writes, 1Q posted the slowest growth. DB thinks the economy is now powering ahead at a
blistering 4.2% rate this quarter. (kathleen.madigan@wsj.com)
