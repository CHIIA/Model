The battle for control of the large Elk-Antelope natural gas resource in Papua New Guinea has
reached new heights with Oil Search formally disputing a deal completed this week by InterOil to sell
a stake in the field to French oil giant Total.
Oil Search said on Friday it had issued a "notice of dispute" to InterOil under the joint-venture
operating agreement for the PRL 15 joint venture in which the two have stakes.

It is legally questioning US-listed InterOil's rights to assign a 40.1 per cent interest in the Elk-Antelope
venture in the PRL 15 permit to Total.

That deal was rushed through on Wednesday after InterOil structured a transaction under which
Total would be buying a newly formed corporate entity that held the 40.1 per cent stake, and so
circumvented pre-emptive rights that Oil Search held through its corporate $US900 million
($970 million) acquisition three weeks ago of another shareholder in PRL 15.
Oil Search managing director Peter Botten had on Wednesday already voiced doubts about the
validity of the InterOil-Total deal, and said lawyers were studying the terms to ensure the company's
rights were protected.
InterOil said on Friday it would "strongly defend" any legal action by Oil Search seeking to void the
deal.
Adding further intrigue to the situation is talk that ExxonMobil, operator of the $US19 billion liquefied
natural gas venture under construction in PNG, made a last-ditch attempt this week to foil the Total
deal, lobbing a higher offer for the stake with InterOil.

The wrangling over Elk-Antelope, which is thought to hold at least 7 trillion cubic feet of gas, has its
origins in the pivotal part the gas field will play in the next phase of development of the LNG sector in
PNG. Total wants to use the Elk-Antelope gas for its own LNG project in PNG, separate to the
$US19 billion project being built by ExxonMobil.
But Exxon and Oil Search, a partner in PNG LNG, want to use the gas for an expansion of their
project.
InterOil chief executive Mike Hession defended the process that led to the deal with Total. In Hong
Kong this week Dr Hession said InterOil held "an open and transparent bidding process" for
the stake in Elk-Antelope, and said InterOil had selected the "best value" offer.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Williams said his key concern was that the legal dispute over
the gas would slow drilling planned at the Elk-Antelope fields this year. "My concern is not who
ultimately ends up owning that interest. The great risk is you don't do the drilling you need to do to
prove up the resource."
