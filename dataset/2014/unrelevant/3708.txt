0046 GMT [Dow Jones] The window for new Australian LNG projects has slammed shut, as cheaper
competing natural gas supplies loom from Russia and the U.S., says Macquarie. That's bad news for
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL.AU), which wants to decide whether to develop the Browse natural gas
resource offshore northwestern Australia with partners including Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA,
RDSA.LN) late next year. "Australian projects are being pushed up the cost curve at an alarming rate,"
says the broker, while noting around 80 million tons per annum of U.S.-produced LNG is slated to flow
into global markets, with costs there assisted by low shale gas prices. Russia is also working hard to put
its momentous export deal with China into action, with pipeline supplies expected by 2025. Macquarie
rates Woodside at underperform, but likes Oil Search Ltd. (OSH.AU) because it operates in Papua New
Guinea, where costs are more competitive. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

17:57 EST - Wayfair (W) shares fall as much as 7.5% in after-hours trading, marking a poor showing in
its first earnings report after going public in October. The online home goods retailer reported $336.2M in
3Q sales, above analysts $309M expectations, but a net loss of 71c/share, which compares with Street's
forecast of 38c/share loss. The company is a test case for e-commerce players who hope to compete
with Amazon (AMZN) by carving out a niche that AMZN doesn't yet serve well. Shares down 4.3% after
hours at $26.90. (greg.bensinger@wsj.com; @gregbensinger)

17:50 EST - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA BRKB) has at least $25B of excess cash to
use for acquisitions, Barclays estimates. In a research note today that follows BRKB's 3Q results last
week, Barclays says BRKB's $56B of cash was significantly above the $20B Mr. Buffett has said he likes
to keep as a margin of safety. Even accounting for several pending deals, including a $2.9B acquisition
of Canadian power transmission companyAltaLink and a $3B preferred stock investment as part of
Burger King's (BKW) deal for Tim Hortons (THI), BRKB has a huge leftover cash pile. What's more, Mr.
Buffett can always issue debt or sell stocks from the company's $119B stock portfolio if he wants to
snare an especially gigantic "elephant" -- his term for double-digit-billion-dollar deals.

17:34 EST - Peer to peer lender Social Finance Inc., often referred to as SoFi, which specializes in
student loans, has raised over $303M in its latest round of private-student loan securitizations that the
firm completed on Monday. The notes are backed by private student loans the firm recently refinanced.
The loans are being repaid by graduate borrowers, most of whom have high credit scores and are
employed. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs led the transaction, which also involved Barclays and
Deutsche Bank selling the notes to retail and institutional investors. This marks the lender's third and
largest round of private-student loan securitizations since December 2013. It raised $151M then and
another $251M in July. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

17:27 EST - Anadarko Petroleum (APC) will keep total executive compensation flat compared with 2013,
the company says. APC's shares, which are up 16% so far this year, had risen more than 40% before
the recent fall in oil prices. At Anadarko's annual meeting in May, 61.5% of votes cast approved of the
company's pay practices, a relatively low level of support. (daniel.gilbert@wsj.com; @WSJGilbert)

17:22 EST - Caesars Entertainment (CZR) says it has "commenced formal discussions with several
groups of creditors" to improve the financial condition of its Caesars Entertainment Operating unit, the
owner of 44 gaming and resort properties. Cash at the unit fell to $1.48B as of Sept. 30, from $2.15B at
the end of July. The company says more discussion of CEOC's capital structure will come in its 10-Q,

$10.70. (matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.com)

2220 GMT - Incitec Pivot (IPL.AU) has some good and bad news for investors in its FY result, with an
unexpected swag of writedowns blighting an underlying performance that's easily beat market
expectations. A 21% rise in underlying profit -- which strips out nonrecurring items -- to A$356.3 million
compared to Deutsche Bank's estimate of A$303.2 million, which the broker says compared to the
analysts' consensus estimate of A$309 million. On the other hand, Deutsche Bank said in a preview
note Monday it didn't expect any one-off nasties. Incitec has revealed impairment and restructure
charges of A$109.2 million at businesses and facilities in Turkey, China and the U.S. combining to drag
down its bottom line net profit by 33% to A$247.1 million. (ross.kelly@wsj.com)

17:04 EST - Shaygan Kheradpir started as CEO of Juniper Networks (JNPR) on January 1. Today, he's
out of a job after what the company said was a board review of his leadership and a difference of
opinions. It's a dramatic turn for the former Barclays (BCS) and Verizon (VZ) executive. Within his first
month on the job, he faced two activists when Elliott Management and Jana announced stakes. They
pushed cost cuts and changes to business structure. Kheradpir earned praise for pledging to be an
"agent of change" and soon settled with Elliott. JNPR launched a buyback and cost savings program.
JNPR, down 4.7% YTD, slips 1.6% to $21.15 after hours. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit)
16:55 EST - Technological innovation as applied in energy production is far from over, even as such
technologies as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling have helped the advance of the shale boom,
says investment boutique Cascadia Capital. The firm just opened a Houston office because "it became
quite apparent over the last two years that we need to be in the energy epicenter of Houston," says
managing director Jamie Boyd. Cascadia is also looking at ways to adapt technology from other sectors
to help enhance oil and gas drilling, well completion, reservoir monitoring and other applications. "You've
just begun to see the effect of technology," says Bob Schwartz, a former engineer hired by Cascadia to
lead the Houston office. "We are scratching the surface." (shasha.dai@wsj.com; @ShashaDai1)

16:47 EST - The next four weeks will be critical for Australia's GrainCorp (GNC.AU), says JPMorgan. A
lack of rainfall in October, combined with above-average temperatures, has reduced moisture levels in
the soil. That poses an increased chance that winter crop yields will disappoint on Australia's east coast.
JPMorgan says its underweight call and A$7.60/share price target reflects the potential for GrainCorp to
miss consensus estimates in FY15 and FY16 as a result of poor cropping conditions. The broker also
worries about competition as rivals build more grain-handling infrastructure. A weakening outlook on crop
production "would put further downward pressure on our earnings forecasts, which is already 20% below
consensus at the ebit line," JPM says. GNC last traded at A$8.58. (david.winning@wsj.com;

16:38 EST - Nike (NKE) could post a $0.28 dividend later this month, an increase of about 15%,
according to analysis from Citi. The firm, which raises its price target for the swoosh to $107, cites with
their prediction recent comments by Nike management to increase returns to shareholders. Nike's stock
price, which closed up Monday at $94.96, close to its 52-week high, would be most impacted by any
potential downturn in the North American market, the firm adds. (sara.germano@wsj.com;

16:34 EST - BMO Capital Markets says deep drop in Canada's jobless rate to 6.5% in October is an
important development. "In the past 40 years, the only time the unemployment rate has been this low or
lower was the three years from late 2005 to late 2008," firm says. But this notable tightening in the job
market has yet to show up in any wage pressure, BMO says. It normally takes about a year for changes
in the job market to be reflected in wages, but they are even weaker than that formula suggests, says
BMO. "The bottom line for the [Bank of Canada] is that they can overlook the sudden tightening in the
jobless rate, at least for now," firm adds. (don.curren@wsj.com; @dbcurren)
