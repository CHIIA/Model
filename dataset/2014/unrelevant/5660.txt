Sydney's tallest residential tower will have a level 82 but there will really only be 66 floors.

The mysterious disappearing floors are an example of an influx of foreign buyers, further underlined by
Treasury figures showing NSW is witnessing a boom in approvals for foreign buyers.

In the nine months to March there were 5245 property approvals for foreign buyers worth A$9.61
billion, which is on a course to double the 3475 approvals worth $5.57 billion for the 2012-13 financial
year.
The developer of Greenland Centre, China's state-owned Greenland Group, has carefully avoided any
reference to the number four, because "four" and "death" have a similar look and pronunciation in
Mandarin.

So there's no level four, 14, 24 or 34. An entire 10 floors between level 39 and 50 don't exist. And of
course no level 54, 64 or 74.

Same goes with the numbers of the apartments.

"No-one wants to get any mail to number four - every time you spell out the number on your door it
sounds like 'death' - it's a very bad number," says David Milton, managing director of residential
projects at CBRE. Greenland Centre has been hugely popular with buyers, with about 85 per cent -
410 of the 484 apartments - already sold.

The buyers of the level 81 and 82 penthouses - priced between $5.6 million and $9.7 million - will be
extremely lucky since eight sounds similar to "prosper" or "wealth".
One individual, who spends part of the year in China and the rest in Australia, is apparently keen on
three.
However, rooftop gardens in Chinese towers are apparently to be avoided because they could
represent a green hat.
"Wearing a green hat" is a term that Chinese use when a woman cheats on her husband. Fairfax
