11:38 EDT - BP was the most active bidder in the auction of offshore oil and gas leases in the western
Gulf of Mexico. According to preliminary statistics issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
BP submitted bids on 32 offshore blocks. The next highest number of bids was BHP Billiton's (BHP) 17
bids and 11 from ConocoPhillips (COP). Venari Offshore and Focus Exploration were also active. Details
of the winning bids will be released shortly. BP down 0.5% at $48.05. (russell.gold@wsj.com)

11:32 EDT - Looking for the next big idea in big data? Hilary Mason has one for you. The data
scientist-turned venture capitalist has launched a consultancy called Fast Forward Labs. Every three
months, the company publishes a newsletter detailing the most cutting edge big data technologies --
and the startups or academics making forays in those areas. For example, a recent newsletter was about
automated content, software algorithms that can generate media content such as news stories. Mason's
team then showed how the technology could be used in new ways -- for example, to generate copy for
online real estate listings and other ads. Mason's newsletter is a good first read for anyone interested in
data science, a fast-growing area of the economy that still baffles most corporations.

11:24 EDT - E&P investors might be worried about weaker oil-and-gas prices, but producers aren't. WTI
crude has dropped $13/barrel the past 2 months and a cool summer has stalled out the natural-gas rally,
causing nervousness among investors. But at EnerCom Consulting's industry conference in Denver this
week, there's very little discussion of the commodity environment, says Tudor Pickering's Matthew
Portillo. Why? E&P firms tend to budget projects at $90/barrel, and WTI remains above that. For gas,
continuing efficiency gains as producers keep experimenting with drilling-and-completion techniques are
driving down break-even prices to closer to $4/MMBtu than the $4.50 which used to be the threshold.
Gas is "truly a commoditized business," says Portillo--good news for consumers, some comfort to
gas-stock investors and less so for those making straight bets on a renewed gas rally.

11:24 EDT - The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management auctioned 79,700 acres offshore Maryland
for wind-energy development. The area, about 10 miles off the coast of Ocean City, was split into two
parcels; US Wind Inc. submitted the winning bids on both parcels. The government said a fully
developed area could provide 850-1,450 megawatts, enough power for 300,000 homes. The winning
bids totaled $8.7M. This is the sixth commercial wind lease awarded by the government. The others are
off the coasts of Massachusetts, Delaware, Rhode Island and Virginia. (russell.gold@wsj.com;

11:23 EDT - Despite its various forays into things like driverless cars and wearable computers, Google
(GOOGL) is no less committed to search, it's profit machine. Search executive Amit Singhal said in a
post on Google+ that the company has made 890 changes to its search algorithms in the past year. He
also highlighted 10 of the most important changes to the service in the past decade, including
autocomplete, search for mobile devices and voice search. GOOGL off a fraction at $594.74.

11:19 EDT - Morgan Stanley is getting more bullish on the lodging industry, saying, "Fundamentals
appear better than what we had originally forecasted." Strong 2Q RevPAR and improving growth
prospects overseas leads the investment bank to raise its sectorwide 2015 RevPAR growth estimate to
6.3% from 5.9%. Its favorite stocks include Hilton (HLT) for its hotel pipeline and earnings growth from

11:16 EDT - Intellectual Ventures, granddaddy of all the patent-holding companies, is laying off about
20% of its staff, or about 140 of its 700 current workforce. Founded in 2000 by former Microsoft (MSFT)
chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold, it made money buying up patents and aggressively licensing
them to enterprising technology companies and others. In late 2010, IV changed course, and decided for
the first time to make use of the courts. Payouts have gone more slowly than usual. A spokesman said
the cuts would enable it to "maintain and expand" leadership in the "market for invention."

11:15 EDT - Dismal sales of construction excavators continue in China, as industry-wide unit sales
during July slipped 28% from year ago, says William Blair. July is typically a slow month for excavators,
but Blair isn't expecting improvement, predicting 30%-plus declines for the rest of the year against
tougher comparison figures. The firm forecasts total unit sales at about 90K this year, a long way from
the market peak of about 180K excavators in 2011 that was fueled by overheated construction activity.
Caterpillar (CAT) continues to pick up share in a down market with an 11.7% excavator stake in July, up
2.6 percentage points from a year ago. (robert.tita@wsj.com)
11:13 EDT - Shares of the nation's biggest apartment landlords are trading at all-time highs as
construction of multifamily residential buildings surges. AvalonBay (AVB) and Equity Residential
(EQR), the 2 largest apartment REITs, recently topped the prior highs set in 2012 and have continued to
see its shares climb while the likes of Essex (ESS) and Post Properties (PPS) are also at new peaks
today. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday apartment construction last month was at its
strongest pace in 8 1/2 years. But some sector executives, including AVB CEO Tim Naughton, have
cautioned of late that demand, as well as new construction, may be leveling off.

11:09 EDT - Tech-stock analyst Brian Marshall is leaving ISI Group for a gig with an as-yet unnamed
private software company, he says in a note today. And he's giving up a payout to do so, according to
regulatory filings. He was among the equity-holders in Evercore's (EVR) all-stock deal to purchase ISI,
and the first chunk of shares will vest upon the deal's closing, expected in the fourth quarter, according to
the filings. His departure is at least the second since the deal was announced August 4--the first was
former Evercore bank analyst Andrew Marquardt, who wasn't an equity holder.

11:02 EDT - The agreement between Bristol (BMY) and Celgene (CELG) to collaborate on a cancer trial
illustrates how quickly companies are moving to test new immunotherapy agents in combination with
other treatments. BMS' nivolumab is among an emerging class of agents called checkpoint inhibitors
which unleash the immune system to attack cancer. They've shown the most promise against melanoma.
Nivo isn't yet FDA-approved, but the plan to test it with CELG's Abraxane against Her-2 negative
metastatic breast cancer and other tumors reflects hope that such drug cocktails will help broaden
immunotherapy's benefits to a variety of cancers. CELG climbs 1.7%, hitting a fresh record high, while
BMY is off 0.2%.(ron.winslow@wsj.com)

11:02 EDT - GE is establishing a new beachhead for its life sciences unit in Massachusetts. A decade
ago, GE moved its global healthcare headquarters to the UK as part of its acquisition of Amersham. The
company plans to invest $21M in a new life sciences headquarters in Marlborough, Mass., promising
220 new jobs. GE has been moving around its business units of late; last year it moved the oil & gas
headquarters to London from Florence, Italy, and its transportation HQ moved to Chicago from Erie, Pa.,
in 2012. GE sees growth in its $4B life sciences unit. Earlier this year, it bought several life sciences
businesses from Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) for $1.06B. (kate.linebaugh@wsj.com)
