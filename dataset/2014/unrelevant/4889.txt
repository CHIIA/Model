* The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for China dipped to 50.5 in January from December's 51,
in line with market expectations.

dragged on output as manufacturers shut up shop for China's biggest annual holiday, Reuters reported.

"Floor will be 5125. Ceiling will be 5241.. close at 5169, down 21 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower
with the local futures contract down 23 points. The weight of evidence suggests that our market should
challenge its 28-October-2013 high of 5457 points going forward.

"The same evidence warns us however that it may be the last act in an intermediate term topping
process.
"The retailers are the canary in the coal mine - they took out their December low on the recent downturn
and look set to challenge their June-2012 low in due course.

"The Tech sector, another growth sector, came close to breaking its December low. "And the banks are
struggling too.

"Unless these sectors gain upside traction, the writing is on the wall for a larger decline going forward.

Page8of42©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."But none of this matters for today. I am hedging my bets with the high and low today. The floor will be
5125. The ceiling will be 5241. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at 5169, down 21
points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 1.9 points to 5190 last Friday.

Job ads in Australia fell in January for the third consec month

ANZ reported jobs fell in January for the third straight month, but the pace of decline moderated, taking
the year-on-year rate of fall to -8.9%. This was markedly slower than the year-on-year fall of over 15%
seen in most months of 2013. In trend terms, job ads contracted by a modest 0.3% in January, which was
the slowest rate of monthly decline since early 2012.

ANZ said it remains cautious about reading too much into job ads trend around

the turn of the year due to changes in timing of trading days around the

holiday. But ANZ still said it expects to see the beginnings of a moderate

upturn in advertising. There were some positive signs of improving labour demand

in a number of areas, ANZ said, adding, despite declining quite sharply in

January, labour demand in New South Wales had been trending modestly higher

according to a number of different job ads and vacancies measures. Job ads in

Western Australia and the Northern Territory had improved in trend terms in

recent months, following significant weakness over the past two years or so as
mining activity moderated and job advertising in Victoria fell, but at a much

slower pace.

Home prices across Australia's major cities rose 1.2 % in January, from the previous month, extending a

of 11.9 % while Perth saw an increase of 6.9 %.

Outlook
The company said the retail landscape in Australasia and South Africa in the second half of this financial
year is likely to remain highly competitive with consumer and business confidence remaining cautious and
the arrival of more new market entrants in Australia.
"Against this backdrop we expect the group to deliver further improved results for the remainder of the
financial year but at a lower growth rate now that comparative results include Witchery and Mimco in
Australasia".

Generation bid. EPW's "business as usual" 2015 EBITDAIF guidance is $102 million/$106 million and
underlying NPAT guidance is $36/39 million.

Analyst expectations: $12.7 mln, div 5.5c
Analyst comment: on January 21 a leading broker, valuing MacGen at $1.4 billion said the acquisition
would be game changing for EPW. However with a significant capital raising likely needed to fund the
transaction ($A320/430 million) and a higher cost of funding compared with competing bidders, we
believe it will be tough for EPW to get over the line".
