BHP Billiton Ltd. has indicated its intentions to sell its West African iron ore assets, The Australian
Financial Review reported March 11.
"We want to move out of our West Africa position," president of iron oreJimmy Wilson was quoted by the
publication as saying to delegates at an iron ore conference in Perth, Australia.

The company's focus is on achieving iron ore production of 212 million tonnes per annum in full year
2014 from its Pilbara, Western Australia, operations, the report said.
Wilson said BHP Billiton anticipates global iron ore supply to outpace demand over the medium term,
with Chinese steel demand expected to peak at 1.1 billion tonnes per annum around 2025.
He also noted, according to The Australian Financial Review, that recent world iron ore growth had been
driven by Australian production, and that demand over the next 10 years will be maintained as 1.2 billion
people globally moved to urban areas, including 240 million people in China.
Separately, Rio Tinto chief executive of iron ore Andrew Harding was quoted by the publication as saying
that the company's current iron ore production ramp up to 290 million tonnes per annum is expected to
be achieved ahead of schedule.
