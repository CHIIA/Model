Key Highlights

-- Since late 2012, construction activity in Australia has been fairly
with the industry posting a contraction of 0.2% in real value-added
in 2013. This followed an annual average growth of 6.8% in real terms in
2011-2012. However, potential growth has emerged in the form of the
building permits for dwelling units reaching 51,417 in the fourth
of 2013, a growth of 23.2% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Permits for
houses rose by 14.7%, whereas permits (excluding houses) grew by 33.8%
during the same period. The forecast-period outlook for construction in
Australia remains positive due to low interest and unemployment rates
improvements in consumer and investor confidence.

-- The government's focus on road and rail infrastructure development is
expected to support economic growth and improve regional connectivity.

its 2013-2014 budget, the government allocated AUD24.0
billion) under the Nation Building Program to expand the country's road,
rail and port infrastructure by 2018-2019.

-- According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the seasonally
adjusted number of permits for total dwelling and non-residential units
combined in February 2014 measured 16,669, an increase of 23.2% compared
with February 2013. According to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the
supply of new housing units per year is 154,000, whereas the country
needs around 170,000 units, based on an average population growth of
a year. Over the forecast period, growth in the residential market will
be driven by the need to balance housing unit demand and supply.

1.6%

-- The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its policy interest rate to a record
low of 2.5% in September 2013, a level at which it has remained. This
helped to support an improvement in business confidence across various
sectors, which is expected to contribute to demand for office buildings.
Moreover, the higher yield on asset prices, better leasing conditions
the recovery of the Australian real estate investment trust has helped
attract investors to purchase office buildings. As a result, the office
buildings category is expected to expand over the forecast period.

and

-- Various challenges such as decisions by Ford and GM in 2013 to shut down

their manufacturing operations by 2017, a decline in new orders, tough
competition in the international market and the slowing resource market
due to slowing down of the industrial growth in the Chinese economy have
all affected the Australian manufacturing industry. As a result, the
manufacturing plants category is likely to grow at a slower pace over
forecast period.
