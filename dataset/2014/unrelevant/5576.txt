Pacific Equity Partners is poised to sell New Zealand biscuit maker Griffin's Foods, sources said at
the weekend.

A deal is close to being signed with an offshore trade player and may be announced as early as
Monday, subject to final negotiations. The sale price is said to be north of $NZ650 million
($601 million).

PEP, Australia's largest private equity firm, bought into Griffin's Foods in 2006 and has been trying
to offload the asset for some time. It ran a sale process in late 2012 with the help of Goldman Sachs
and UBS.
Bright Food was known to have tabled a low-ball bid for Griffin's but the Chinese food conglomerate
is not involved in current discussions.

Griffin's was founded in 1864 by John Griffin and makes Huntley & Palmers crackers and savoury
snacks under the Eta brand. It has about 800 employees and sells more than $NZ300 million of
products every year, according to its website.
PEP bought Griffin's Foods from France's Danone for $NZ385 million. It has since doubled the
company's earnings to about $80 million.
Elsewhere, Medibank Private has hired boutique firm Reunion Capital Partners – started by former
senior Goldman Sachs bankers Mike Everett and Rob Penney – to provide capital markets advice
on its mooted $4 billion privatisation.
Sources said while the joint lead managers are responsible for planning and selling the initial public
offering, Reunion will work with Medibank's board and management.

Reunion Capital fought off competition from two or three other firms at a beauty parade earlier this
month to secure the mandate.
It comes after Reunion helped Insurance Australia Group on its capital raise for the acquisition of
Wesfarmers' insurance underwriting unit in December.
Reunion has also tended to Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra, and Asaleo, during its initial public offering.

Everett and Penney retained Lidia Ranieri in January.
