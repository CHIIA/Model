The Anti-Dumping Commission is investigating a claim by Arrium subsidiary OneSteel that a host of
steel exporters including South Korea, Thailand and Turkey are injuring the company by "dumping"
cheap product in Australia.

The investigation comes in the wake of Arrium's shock $754 million equity raising, undertaken to
reduce debt in the face of collapsing iron ore prices and sustained losses in the steel business.

On August 8 OneSteel lodged an application requesting that Bob Baldwin, parliamentary secretary to
Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane, publish a dumping duty notice in respect of steel reinforcing bar
(rebar) exported to Australia from Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.

OneSteel alleges the Australian steel industry has "suffered material injury" in the form of lost sales
volumes, reduced market share, lower prices and reduced profits due to the export of rebar at prices
below actual product value (dumping).

OneSteel is Australia's only producer of rebar, manufacturing rebar products at Whyalla, Laverton
and Newcastle. The Australian rebar market was between 750,000 tonnes and 1 million tonnes in
2013-14.
Arrium's OneSteel business sold 2.07 million tonnes of steel in 2013-14 and generated just $51
million of earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) on $2.9 billion of revenue.

The anti-dumping claim covers steel products that account for about 30 per cent of OneSteel's total
sales.

In 2013-14 imports from the countries accused of dumping increased by 20 per cent on the previous
year, compared with 2 per cent growth the year before. OneSteel said that the size of the Australian
rebar market contracted 2 per cent in 2013-14 and that its own sales declined 5 per cent, while
exports of dumped rebar from the nominated countries increased by 33 per cent.
As a softening Chinese property market and anaemic global economic growth dampen steel
demand, a lot of product is looking for a home.

The Canada Border Services Agency launched an investigation into alleged dumping of concrete
reinforcing bar from China, Korea, and Turkey on June 13. It found dumping had occurred and
imposed provisional duties.

"The commission is satisfied that... there appears to be reasonable grounds for concluding that rebar
has been exported to Australia from the nominated countries at dumped prices and the dumping
margins are not negligible," it said.

allegedly dumped imports of rebar."

After the investigation Mr Baldwin will determine whether to reject OneSteel's claim or impose interim
dumping duties.
