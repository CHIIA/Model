Private equity fund Denham Capital has launched its first Australian mining investment, committing
$200 million to newly-formed coal venture Pembroke Resources in a deal spearheaded by the
firm's Perth-based mining team.

Denham, which last year shifted its Asia Pacific head office from Singapore to Perth, will back
Pembroke's plans to acquire and develop a portfolio of metallurgical coal assets.

Pembroke is led by chief executive Barry Tudor and chief operating officer Mark Sheldon, who
previously served as executives at former ASX-listed miner Gloucester Coal.
Gloucester Coal merged with Chinese state-owned giant Yancoal Australia last year in a deal worth
about $640 million.
Denham partner Bert Koth, who heads up the firm's Perth-based Australasian region, said
Pembroke's directors had delivered strong results in the coal sector.
"The work Barry and his team did at Gloucester Coal delivered one of the great success stories in
the Australian coal industry," he said.

"We are very excited to back such a proven group as the market's current weakness provides an
ideal opportunity to build a new mid-tier metallurgical coal company."
Pembroke said Denham would provide the company with a competitive advantage through its
strategic, operational and financial backing.
Boston-based Denham has more than $7.9 billion of invested and committed capital across seven
fund vehicles.
