Moody's Investors Service says the performance of Australian auto ABS transactions was stable in
September 2014 compared with August 2014, as delinquencies in excess of 30 days remained at 1.0%.

The performance of Australian prime RMBS deals was also stable in September 2014 compared with
August 2014, with delinquencies in excess of 30 days remaining at 1.3%.

In addition, the performance of Australian prime RMBS deals compared favorably with other markets. For
example, the 60-day-plus delinquency rate in Australia stood at 0.7% in September 2014, compared with
over 5% for US RMBS deals during the same period.

Moody's analysis is contained in its just-released report titled "Global Structured Finance Collateral
Performance Review."
Moody's report says its outlook on the performance of Australian ABS and RMBS transactions remains
stable.

"Our stable outlook is underpinned by our economic forecasts for modest 2.5%-3.5% GDP growth in
Australia, an ongoing low cash rate of around 2.5%, and a broadly stable unemployment rate of
5.5%-6.5%," says Alena Chen, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst.
