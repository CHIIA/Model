Overview ? Hong Kong's role as a leading business centre in the Asia-Pacific region owes much to its
advanced telecommunications infrastructure, which facilitates domestic and international communications
by voice or data. The role of telecommunications is especially vital to Hong Kong's competitiveness in the
age of electronic commerce. In 2011, the industry of information and communications generated HK$ 63
billion (US$ 8 billion), contributing to 3.3% of GDP. ? Digital 21, the blueprint for Hong Kong’s
information and communication technology (ICT) development, was last updated in 2008. The 2008 Digital
21 Strategy highlighted five action areas: (1) Facilitating a digital economy; (2) promoting advanced
technology and innovation; (3) developing Hong Kong as a hub for technological cooperation and trade;
(4) enabling the next generation of public services; and (5) Building an inclusive, knowledge-based
society. ?

To increase the land supply for science and technology development, the government has allocated a site
of about two hectares in Tseung Kwan O to develop a high-tier data centre, opened for tender in 2013. ?
The advanced technology and quality services of Hong Kong's telecommunications sector attract
multinational companies, such as AT&T and Verizon, to set up their regional operations in Hong Kong. ?
Hong Kong's telecommunications industry is totally privately owned and faces no restriction on foreign
investment. All telecommunication services are open for competition. ? With the opening up of the
telecommunications market in most countries, many Hong Kong operators, such as Hutchison, have
gained a foothold in overseas markets, particularly in the mobile phone sector. ? In the Global Information
Technology Report 2013 by the World Economic Forum, Hong Kong ranks fourth in Asia (14th in the
world) in the Network Readiness Index, indicating Hong Kong’s advanced position in telecommunication
infrastructure, regulatory environment, and business readiness of using information technology. Industry

Office of the Communications Authority Local Fixed Telecommunications Network Services (FTNS): The
FTNS market has been fully liberalised since 1 January 2003, with no pre-set limit on the number of
licences issued, nor specific requirement on network rollout or investment. As at June 2013, there were 20
local fixed network operators in Hong Kong. As at September 2012, there were about 4.3 million
exchange lines in the city, a density of 102 lines per 100 households or 60% by population, which was
among the highest in the world. Mobile Services: As at December 2012, there were 5 mobile network
operators. In April 2013, the number of mobile service subscribers reached 16.4 million, representing one
of the highest penetration rates in the world at about 229%. Among these subscribers, 10.7 million were
2G and 3/4G service customers. Broadband Services: As at June 2013, there were 194 Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) licensed to provide broadband services. As at September 2012, more than 2.27 million
customers are now using broadband services with speed up to 1,000 Mbps (Megabits per second). In the
residential market, 87% of the households are using broadband service. Internationally, Hong Kong's

Page193of210©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.broadband penetration rate is among the highest in the world. This has facilitated the development of IPTV
- as at November 2012, there were nearly 1.36 million IPTV subscribers. The International Direct Dialling
(IDD): International Direct Dialing (IDD) service to most countries and regions of the world is available. In
2011, the volume of outgoing and incoming traffic for telephone calls was 7,646 million minutes and 2,896
million minutes respectively. Cost of IDD calls has gone down significantly since January 1999, when
fixed-line operators were allowed to offer non-exclusive international services. Satellite: As at November
2012, there were 41 licensees permitted to operate either external cable or non-cable based facilities for
the provision of external communication services in Hong Kong, with more than 185 satellite earth station
antennas in operation. Hong Kong adopts an open sky policy in regulating the provision of satellite
services. Hong Kong provides dedicated relay services for multinational companies, international press
agencies and TV channels to downlink or uplink their satellite signals over the Asia Pacific region.
Submarine Cable: Hong Kong is connected to a number of submarine cable systems, including: ? The
Okinawa-Luzon-Hong Kong system connects Hong Kong to the Philippines, Japan and North America. ?
The Asia Pacific Cable (APC) system links Hong Kong to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan. ? The
Thailand-Vietnam-Hong Kong (TVH) system connects Hong Kong to Thailand and Vietnam. ? The Asian
Pacific Cable Network (APCN) system connects Hong Kong to Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. ? The Fibre-optic Link Around the Globe
(FLAG) connects Hong Kong to Thailand, Shanghai, South Korea, Japan and other countries around the
world. ? The SEA-ME-WE-3 cable connects Hong Kong to various countries in South East Asia, Middle
East and the Western Europe. ? The Asian Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2) connects Hong Kong to the
Chinese Mainland, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and other Asian countries. ? C2C Network connects Hong
Kong to the Philippines, Taiwan and Singapore. ? The Asia America Gateway (AAG) connects Southeast
Asia and North America, via Hong Kong, Guam and Hawaii. ? The East Asia Crossing (EAC) connects
Hong Kong with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Chinese mainland, Singapore and the Philippines. ?
The North Asia Cable System (NACS) connects Hong Kong with Japan and Taiwan. ? The Reach North
Asia Loop (RNAL) connects Hong Kong with Taiwan, Korea and Japan. ? The Trans Pacific Cable
(TPC-1 & TPC-2) connects Hong Kong with Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, South
Korea, Guam and Hawaii. ? The VSNL SG HK JP Guam connects Hong Kong with Singapore, Japan and
Guam. Exports The main form of cross-border exports of telecommunications services is through incoming
calls from another country, in the form of revenue collected for the service of completing the call. Other
export incomes are derived from: ? offering roaming services to overseas mobile phone users; ? selling
satellite transponder capacities to other telecommunications operators, broadcasting and multinational
corporations to meet their regional communications, broadcasting and international communications
needs; ? consultancy services (e.g. technology transfer and training programmes) to overseas customers;
and ? telecommunications services provided to travellers to Hong Kong. With the opening up of the
telecommunications market in most countries, many Hong Kong operators have gained a foothold in the
overseas markets, particularly in the mobile telephone sector. For example, Hutchison Telecom has 3G
operations in different regions and countries (e.g. the UK, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, Israel,
Macau, Australia and Austria). Many other operators have invested in the development of
telecommunications networks in Asia, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and
Vietnam. The bulk of Hong Kong's international call traffic is now with the Chinese mainland.
International private leased circuits are offered to several mainland gateway cities, while some operators
provide roaming services to mobile phone and pager users when they are on the mainland. Exports of

Department Industry Development and Market Outlook Local industry developments As of end-June 2008,
mandatory type II interconnection policy had been withdrawn. Type II interconnection is a regulatory tool
widely deployed in the world, requiring the incumbent fixed network operator (“FNO”) to open up its
copper-based customer access network (CAN) to new entrants so that the latter may provide competing
service to customers in the start-up phase when their own self-built CANs are not as extensive as the
incumbent’s. Now over 86% of local households have the choice of more than one FNO. The increasing
use of data services such as instant messaging and mobile internet services among the younger
generations helps stimulate the mobile data usage in Hong Kong. As at September 2012, local mobile
data usage recorded a remarkable surge to 6,347,228 Gigabytes. This represents a double in the mobile
data usage over 2011 and 4.3 times over the same period in 2010. After 29 new digital terrestrial
television (DTT) fill-in stations launched in 2011, the coverage of DTT services has been expanded to 96%
in early 2012. Citing a public survey conducted in June 2012, take-up rate of DTT increased to 73.5% of
total number of households in Hong Kong. The development of FTTH (Fibre-to-the-home) technologies
goes fast in Hong Kong. The household penetration of FTTH, FTTB (Fibre-to-the-home) and local area
networks is around 45%, as at February 2012. WiFi access is increasingly widespread in Hong Kong. As
at June 2013, there were more than 19,495 public WiFi hot spots in Hong Kong. Since the Hong Kong
government launched the Government WiFiprogramme in 2007, there were free public WiFi services in
415 government premises as at May 2013. Macro-trends in the industry "Going wireless" continues to gain
momentum in the global consumer market - according to the GSM Association, mobile networks provides
coverage to over 90% of the world's population in 2012. Worldwide mobile data bandwidth usage
continues to grow as the mobile phone increasingly integrates into users’ daily life. Services and functions

Page194of210©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.that can be done through the mobile phone include payment, receiving news, exchanging files, music, and
movies, trading, etc. With the deployment of the 4G technologies such as the Long Term Evolution (LTE)
and other advanced technologies progressively by the three broadband wireless access services
providers in the 2.5/2.6 GHz band, consumers can enjoy even higher speed of mobile data services up to
100 Mbps. In Hong Kong, CSL launched its 4G network services in early 2012, while Hutchison and
Smartone announced plans to launch 4G services in 2012. The expansion of 3G/4G networks drives up
the demand for video telephony, sharing and messaging services over mobile networks. According to ABI
Research, in 2011, there were fewer than 47 million consumers using such services, but the take up rate
is expected to grow to 390 million in 2016. ABI Research also forecast that the global mobile TV’s market
revenue will exceed US$ 20 billion by 2015. Following the first launch of 3D TV in 2009, NOW TV
broadcast the first 3D movie on its channel in November 2011, while i-Cable broadcast the first 3D English
Premier League match in January 2012. It is expected that more 3D TV channels will be introduced in the
near future. More countries within the Asia Pacific region, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and
Australia, have rolled out commercial IPTV services in the last 3 years. The China market According to
the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), total fixed investment in the
telecommunications sector reached RMB 361.4 billion as at end-2012, up 8.5%.Total revenue of the
industry reached RMB 1,076.3 billion, up 9.0%. As at the end of 2012, the number of mobile phone users
in China increased by 12.8% to 1.11 billion (equivalent to 82.6 subscribers per 100 persons) while fixed
line phone subscribers dropped by 2.4% to 278.2 million (or 20.7 subscribers per 100 persons). Since the
issue of 3G licences in January 2009 and the launch of 3G services in the following months, 3G usage has
surged on the mainland. As at May 2013, there were more than 304 million 3G users on the Chinese
mainland, 26.1% to the mobile phone subscribers. The explosive growth of 3G usage on the Mainland has
stimulated the need for more 3G services or products, such as wireless music and mobile newspapers.
Strong pricing advantage and improving quality of services has helped raise the competitiveness of
Chinese telecom vendors, such as ZTE Corp. and Huawei Technology. According to the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in 2011, ZTE and Huawei were ranked as first and third globally
in terms of the number of international patent applications. TD-LTE-Advanced, domestically developed on
the mainland and supported by China Mobile, has been recognised by International Telecommunication
Unit (ITU) as a global 4G technology. China Mobile finished phase-I large-scale test of TD-LTE network in
6 cities in 2011, with the phase-II plan to be launched in nine cities in 2012. The Mainland-Hong Kong
Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) Under CEPA, qualified Hong Kong service suppliers
(HKSS) are allowed to set up joint-venture enterprises on the Chinese mainland from 1 October 2003,
providing 5 types of value-added telecommunications services without geographic restriction. These
services include Internet data centre services, store and forward services, call centre services, Internet
access services (i.e. ISP) and content services (i.e. ICP). Hong Kong services suppliers’ shareholding in
the joint venture should not exceed 50%. From January 2008, HKSS are allowed additionally to provide
mainland-IP-based Virtual Private Network (VPN) services as defined in the Telecommunications
Business Classification in the form of a joint venture, with the Hong Kong partner holding a stake of not
more than 50%. Taking effect in October 2009, HKSS can distribute in Guangdong Province fixed and
mobile telephone service cards which can only be used in Hong Kong. Mobile satellite phone service
cards, however, are explicitly excluded. According to CEPA Supplement IX, HKSS are allowed to set up
wholly owned companies or equity joint ventures in providing offshore call centre services in Dongguan
and Zhuhai Cities of Guangdong Province on a pilot basis, with no limitation on the equity ratio of the
Hong Kong side. Under CEPA Supplement X, which will take effect from January 2014, HKSS are
allowed to set up joint-venture enterprises in Guangdong Province to provide online data processing and
transaction processing services (yet confined to e-commerce business websites only). HKSS’s
shareholding should not exceed 55%. Further, contractual service providers employed by HKSS are
allowed to provide this type of services on the mainland in the mode of movement of natural persons. As
at the end of September 2013, there were 48 approved HKSS in the sector of value-added
telecommunications services (including calling cards) out of a total of 53 applications.
