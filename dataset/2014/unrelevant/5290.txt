Australian shares fell as the penultimate day of August company reporting season delivered some
soft results, the iron ore price kept falling and official statistics showed the economy's transition from
mining to non-mining-led business investment is still struggling.

The benchmark S&P / ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each lost 0.5 per cent on
Thursday, to 5624.4 points and 5621.3 points respectively.

Surprisingly, Qantas Airways was the standout performer of the day. The stock flew ahead despite
revealing a massive blowout in its annual loss.
Local shares took a soft lead from the United States, where the S&P 500 ended flat on Wednesday
night, after closing above 2000 points for the first time in the previous session.

Major markets around Asia fell in the afternoon session amid heightened geopolitical risk as ongoing
conflicts in Ukraine and Iraq-Syria escalated.

In local economic news, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed business investment was
stronger than forecast – helped by a lift in outlays by services firms. June-quarter capital expenditure
rose 1.1 per cent. Consensus expectation was for a 0.9 per cent fall. The Australian dollar got a
spike from the news, but shares remained depressed.
"The mix of the capex survey was encouraging, but we think the contrast between falling mining and
improving non-mining investment might end up more stark," Barclays economist Keiran Davies said.
CIMB equity strategist Shane Lee said the capex data was disappointing overall, despite the
better-than-expected headline result.Qantas posts biggest-ever loss
Qantas lifted 7 per cent to $1.39, despite a much bigger-than-forecast $2.8 billion annual net loss,
the biggest in its history, amid heavy write-downs on its fleet.
The size of the loss approaches the $3 billion value of the company as measured by market
capitalisation. But investors chose to focus on the lower-than-expected operating loss and on the
airline's more optimistic outlook.
"Nothing was announced about what the company plans to do with its frequent flyer business. There
is hidden wealth locked up in that division, so Qantas is not a lost cause yet," Zurich Financial
Services senior investment strategist Patrick Noble said.

"While there have been a few disappointments, overall August reporting season has delivered a
pretty solid batch of results."

Television broadcaster Nine Entertainment Co dropped 3.3 per cent to $2.03, despite beating its
prospectus forecasts to show a rise in full-year net profit to $144.2 million.

cent rise in full-year net profit.Miners, banks languish
The biggest miners were weaker as the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, fell to a new
two-year low at $US88.20 a tonne, posting its eighth straight day of losses. BHP Billiton fell 1.2 per
cent to $36.88, while Rio Tinto lost 1.7 per cent to $63.06.

The big four banks were flat to lower. Commonwealth Bank of Australia edged up 2¢ to $81.14, while
Westpac Banking Corporation lost 0.3 per cent to $35.01. ANZ Banking Group fell 0.5 per cent to
$33.37, and National Australia Bank slipped 0.1 per cent to $34.77.

Telecommunications was the only sector to finish higher, as Telstra Corporation rose 0.2 per cent to
$5.54.

Woolworths edged down 1¢ to $36.95, ahead of showing its full-year results on Friday. Rival
Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, was unchanged at $44.76.
