SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen edging higher on Wednesday after firmer U.S.
data pushed the S&P 500 above 2,000 for the first time, with local attention on a raft of earnings results.

* Local share price index futures rose 0.2 percent to 5,605.0, but were at a 32.6-point discount to the
underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark eked out a gain of 0.1 percent on Tuesday.

* New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index added 0.2 percent in early trade.

* U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday to lift the S&P 500 just a hair above the 2,000 mark, its first close
above that milestone, after data that pointed to a brighter future for the economy.
* Spot iron ore prices hit their lowest since September 2012 as swelling supplies weighed, while China's
Dalian iron ore futures rebounded after a six-day slide that dragged the price down to the lowest level
since last year's launch.
* BC Iron Ltd said its full year net profit after tax was A$73.7 million, up 51 percent.
* Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd reported its full year net profit after tax of A$206.9 million versus
A$246.1 million last year. The company also said it is investing in UK-based Topdeck tours in a deal
that values Topdeck at GBP 21.8 million.

* Boral Ltd said it swung to an annual net profit, but missed estimates, led by a recovery in construction
activity and lower losses at its U.S. business.
* Lend Lease Corp Ltd said its annual net profit jumped 50 percent, meeting recently upgraded company
forecasts, as it benefited from the sale of its stake in a UK shopping centre.
