The latest Structured Thinking: Asia Pacific newsletter by Moody's Investors Service's reports that the
number of `interest-only' home loans in Australia is growing rapidly, raising concerns about the impact of
rising house prices.

The newsletter also covers the Australian `low-doc' mortgage market and examines the sharp decline in
condominium sales in Japan.

In Australia, interest-only loans accounted for 43% of all new mortgages in June 2014, up from 39% a
year earlier. This is a negative development for the residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS)
market because interest-only loans have a higher risk of default, particularly if interest rates rise from
record low levels.

At a time when Australian house prices and therefore mortgages are rising rapidly, the concern is that
home buyers are turning to interest-only loans because they can no longer afford repayments on principal
and interest loans.

Also in Australia, the newsletter concludes that tighter lending standards for `low-doc' mortgages are a
positive for the RMBS market. Lending standards for low-doc mortgages - loans to borrowers who cannot
readily verify their income through standard documentation, such as payslips - have improved as a result
responsible lending laws.

On the Japanese market, the newsletter reports that a decline in condominium sales is a negative for the
real estate sector generally.
However, over the longer term, it will be positive for larger real estate developers because it will drive
weaker competitors out of the market. Condominium sales in the Tokyo area declined by 44% in
September compared with the previous year.

The newsletter also reports on recent meetings with investors and other market participants throughout
Asia, where we discussed the future of China's securitization market and demand for Australian RMBS
and covered bonds.
In China, strong ABS issuance has attracted growing interest from investors. Looking ahead, market
participants expect issuance to grow further in 2015 thanks to government initiatives to develop the market
and the emergence of new originators.

In the Australian market, spreads have tightened on senior Aaa-rated RMBS notes, making them less
attractive for Asian investors. Nevertheless, demand for the paper remains stable because of good
performance.

The October edition of Moody's monthly publication contains the following articles:

• Growth in Owner-Occupier Interest-Only Loans is Credit Negative for Future Australian RMBS

• Stronger Low-Doc Lending Standards Are Credit Positive for Australian RMBS
• Decline in Condo Sales to Cement Dominance of Major Property Developers in Japan

MJKK is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody'sGroup Japan G.K., which is
wholly-owned by Moody's Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moody's Corporation

MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a
NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S.
laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and
their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively.

MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate
and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or
MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as
applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to
approximately JPY350,000,000. MCO, MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address
the independence of MJKK and MSFJ's ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain
affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold
ratings from MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership
interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading
