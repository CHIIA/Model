Tomorrow's News Today

Another Liberal member stand aside! Bart Bassett. You couldn't make this stuff up. Must see TV Utopia
tonight too.
Couple of Taiwanese fighters chase the Chinese off. Meanwhile in China, these guys think big, they have
ambition and vision. Not quite like here I am afraid. China is considering providing as much as 100 billion
yuan ($16 billion) in government funding to build electric-vehicle charging facilities and spur demand for
clean cars.
Burger King moves to Canada with its donut purchase. Avoids tax.

Looks like the US is assembling the coalition of the willing to bomb IS in Northern Iraq and Syria. This one
will run and run. Suspect they will sign us up for boots on the ground again.

Seems a sad choice but to defeat IS we need Assad!

UK house prices will end the year 9.5% higher than they started it, but the strength of increases this year
means that in London the market could flatline in 2016.

Off to Queen tonight. Excited!

That is all
