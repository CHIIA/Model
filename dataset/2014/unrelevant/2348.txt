Beijing Capital edges Infratil to win a $880m waste business
CHINESE group Beijing Capital has surprised the market by ousting Infratil to buy Transpacific
Industries' New Zealand waste business for $NZ950 million ($880m) in a deal that is likely to trigger
a return to dividend payments for the $1.9 billion Australian listed company.

Beijing Capital's interest in the operation was first flagged in The Australian earlier this year, although
it was expected the business would be bought by Infratil, the New Zealand listed owner of Wellington
Airport, which was the under-bidder for rival business Envirowaste.
The private equity firm owned by the Chinese government, which specialises in the area of water
treatment, waste management, mass transit railway and toll roads, also beat Macquarie Group and
private equity firmCarlyle Group to purchase the asset in what is thought to be the first major global
deal for Beijing Capital.
Transpacific indicated that the sale, expected to be finalised in June, would enable the company to
pay down debt and likely see a return to dividend payments.
``The sale of our New Zealand business gives Transpacific increased financial flexibility,'' said chief
executive Robert Boucher.

``We will look to enhance our Australian waste management businesses, capture long-term growth
opportunities and generate improved shareholder value.''
Speaking from Hong Kong yesterday, Mr Boucher said a return to dividend payments was
something the company had contemplated before the New Zealand deal.

``This certainly helps offer some clarity on our return to dividends in the future.''
A number of acquisition opportunities for Transpacific had been identified, he said. ``We are not
going to be forthright with our strategies, given our competitors don't have to do so, but this certainly
frees us up to look at complementary assets to our existing core business of solid waste and liquid
waste in Australia.''
Morgans analyst Nathan Lead said the sales price was $20m higher than he had expected.

The deal would see Transpacific lose about 20 per cent of its earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation, but debt should fall from about 1.9 times EBITDA to about 0.2 times.
Transpacific's debt had been ``a noose around their necks'', Mr Lead said, but the deal would enable
a return to dividends and attract investors.
The deal, advised by Deutsche, Chapman Tripp, Ashurst and Guantao Law firm, came after the
business was put up for sale in October in a dual-track process.

8.6 times was the same as that paid by Hong Kong giant CKI for Envirowaste last April, purchased
from Ironbridge Capital for $NZ501m.
The acquisition is likely to be the first of others globally for Beijing Capital, sources said, including
Australia. The company has total assets and revenues worth more than $US21bn ($23bn) and
$US3.7bn respectively and 20,000 employees.

Transpacific shares closed up 0.5c at $1.18.
