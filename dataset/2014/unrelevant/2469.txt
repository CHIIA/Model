Bega Cheese recently announced it had signed a deal to provide UHT milk to a south China retail
group, which will be manufactured for it by Pactum at Shepparton and could eventually require up to
20 million litres annually.
Pactum operations manager Mark McWhirter said it was an exciting step for the company, which was
in a growth phase, and for the industry.

The acquisition of land, associated building and capital requirements is expected to be funded from
existing finance facilities and other assets.
Pactum is a joint venture between regional milk supply company ACM and Freedom Foods.
ACM chairman Michael Auld said the land acquisition was part of the company’s growth strategy.
‘‘Our goal is to be a world class manufacturer of UHT milk and we need to have the right facilities to
support that strategy,’’ he said.

‘‘We will be located on the bypass, 180 km from the Port of Melbourne with only one set of (traffic)
lights.’’
