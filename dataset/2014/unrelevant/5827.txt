(MENAFN - Arab News) Ron jennings an 84-year-old with a penchant for brightly colored shirts has
for decades lived in an apartment block with views of sydney harbor which until now money literally
could not buy.

as a public housing tenant jennings paid a modest rent for his home in the rocks which along with
almost 300 other public housing homes near the sydney harbor bridge is set to be sold.

the sell-off has enraged the community of millers point one so old and historic it contributed to
australia's earliest european settlement and is listed on the state heritage register.

they argue they are being kicked out of the city in favor of the rich.

'the part that upsets me the most � can you ever remember a whole suburb being evicted?
because that's what's happening" jennings told afp.

the government decision ends years of speculation about the fate of the area which abuts the
aus$6 billion ($5.6 billion) barangaroo development set to house a luxury six-star hotel and casino
and the rocks considered the birth place of white settlement in australia.
with still-soaring sydney property prices the highest in the country and chinese investors keen to
snap up real estate in australia's biggest city the new south wales government is pushing asset
sales to help balance the books.

waterfront properties come at a premium in the city where house prices rose 4.9 percent in the last
quarter of 2013 alone according to the australian bureau of statistics.

millers point a small suburb which sits behind the long closed wharves of walsh bay has seen a
growth in high-rise and waterfront developments in recent years as developers moved onto
neglected properties with the wharves now home to luxury apartments and cafes.

the government minister who made the decision pru goward said the 293 properties in millers point
and the rocks were being sold due to high maintenance costs the major investment needed to
make some of them liveable and the 'high potential sale values."

she said the cost of restoring some of the homes to heritage standard was as high as aus$800000
each and she could not justify sinking millions of dollars into a small number of properties while
57000 families were on the wait list for public housing.

'this decision was not taken lightly but it is the right decision in the interest of a sustainable fair
social housing system" she said adding that the proceeds would be reinvested into social housing
around the state.

within days of her announcement residents held a community meeting attended by hundreds of
people in which they vowed to fight the sell-off.

barney gardner who has lived in millers point his whole life said there was no reason why
low-income households should be locked out of the city and the community broken up.

same housing as rich people" he asked the meeting.

'i haven't got much family but youse are" the 65-year-old told the meeting to cheers and applause.

no date has been suggested yet for the sales with goward saying that officials would work with
tenants in coming months to help with their relocation with every resident offered reasonable
alternative accommodation.

maritime workers have lived in millers point for generations and these links between the people and
the property make it a rare if not unique precinct with evidence of human settlement spanning all
historical phases in australia since 1788.

'the degree of integrity of that area the way that we can read the layers of the maritime history of
australia on that site is really second to none" historian shirley fitzgerald told afp.

many houses in millers point were erected by the government in the early 1900s after an outbreak
of the bubonic plague saw many homes torn down.

'the government built public housing in order to make sure that there was a viable maritime
community to service the government wharves" fitzgerald said adding that shops and pubs were
also provided.
'so the whole thing was like a company town for the maritime services board" the body which was
in charge of the housing for many years and which allowed people to pass on houses to family
members provided they were working on the wharves.

fitzgerald believes the sell-off will have a damaging impact on the city.

'what kind of a city can you have when you can't have any working people unless they're on a huge
salary package living in the city? cities just don't work unless you have areas of affordable housing."

'that harbor was a working harbor and the lives and the blood and sweat and tears of thousands
and thousands of working people have gone into making it work for us and now it sees to be okay
to turn around and kick them out."
