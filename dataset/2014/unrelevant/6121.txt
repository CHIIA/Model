On a Quest: Azamara Club Cruises will deploy Azamara Quest to Australia for the first time in 2016. The
boutique 694-guest ship will undertake five voyages, from 10 to 17 nights, during the two-month season,
visiting 25 ports in Australia and New Zealand. Sailings include a 16-night Australia & New Zealand
explorers itinerary departing Sydney on January 15 and ending in Auckland; from $6069 a person
twin-share. More: 1800 754 500; azamaraclubcruises.com.

Fleets ahead: P&O Cruises will have the largest fleet of ships home-ported year-round in Australia when
it welcomes two more vessels, to be transferred from Holland America Line, in November 2015. The
ships will be of similar mid-range size to Pacific Dawn, Pacific Jewel and Pacific Pearl and bring P&O’s
Australia-based inventory to five. The additions will increase Carnival Group’s home-ported vessels in
Australia to 12, under the P&O, Carnival Cruise Lines and Princes Cruises brands. Carnival says its
expansion is in line with strong local demand; Australian cruise passenger numbers have increased 130
per cent in the past five years, with projected further growth from 800,000 passengers last year to one
million by 2016. More: pocruises.com.au.

Royal visit: Royal Caribbean’s Legend of the Seas will sail from Brisbane for the first time during the
2015-16 summer cruise season. Fifteen itineraries in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific will
be offered across five months, before the ship — which had a $50 million makeover last year — returns
to Asia in April 2016. Highlights include an 18-night Brisbane to Hong Kong voyage departing April 20,
2016, calling at the Whitsundays, Cairns, Darwin, Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia, and Manila; from $2499 a
person twin-share. Book before May 31 to save up to 50 per cent on the fare for a second passenger.

One-upmanship: Aurora Expeditions is catering to increasing numbers of solo travellers with a
cabin-sharing service on Antarctic voyages. The company will find a same-sex cabin partner for those
travelling alone; where no suitable sharer can be found, guests will pay only the standard
single-occupancy rate of 1.7 times the twin-share fare. Aurora has seen a spike in the number of solo
travellers on its small-ship Antarctic itineraries; up to 29 per cent of passengers on early season
voyages last year were travelling alone. In the past 12 months 65 per cent of solo passengers were
female. More: 1800 637 688; auroraexpeditions.com.au/solotravellers.

SeaDream I, which caters for a maximum of 112 guests, will depart Dover on August 16 for a 14-night
round-trip visiting ports including Bornholm in Denmark, Sweden’s Visby, Tallinn in Estonia and Sassnitz
on Germany’s Rugen Island, docking in St Petersburg. From $US8749 ($9480) a person twin-share.

Singapore Flyer and return flight to Sydney. From $2459 (Sydney-based passengers); $2850 (ex

Ukraine, with passengers receiving complimentary experiences and onboard credit on some departures.

Trabzon in northeast Turkey replacing Odessa in Ukraine; three new nine-day Istanbul round-trip

Just jamming: Sea Cloud Cruises’ two windjammer yachts — 64-guest Sea Cloud and 94-passenger

voyages cater for a maximum of 170 passengers, start in Cienfuegos in the south and include visits to
the private island of Cayo Blanco and Casilda in Trinidad. From $2425 a person twin-share (seven
nights) or $7165 (18 nights), representing a 25 per cent saving on the normal price. Valid for bookings
