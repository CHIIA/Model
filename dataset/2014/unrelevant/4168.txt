The S&P/ASX200 closed down 61.6 points to 5294, a level last seen on February 12, on giant volume
worth $7 billion - a significant amount would be related to adjustments on the March SPI close today with
the June SPI becoming the active index. There were 331 stocks higher and 629 down. Aussie 10 year
bond yields were 4 points higher to 4.12%.The $A is at 90.06, shedding a little over 1US c since last
evening.

*The banks contributed 14.5 negative points to the index, insurers contributed 1.5 negative points,
resources contributed 10.8 negative points, property trusts contributed 0.3 negative points, retailers
contributed 4.6 negative points and Telstra contributed 2 negative points.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 250 points to 14,170 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
up 7.12 points to 2028.85, Hang Seng futures were down 247 points to 21,286 points, S&P futures was
down 3.3 points to 1848.90, Nasdaq futures fell 6.75 points to 3667.5, Dow futures fell 25 points to 16,114
points.
Spot gold is up $5 to $1334. Crude is up 33c to $100.70.

While a low $A vs the US$ boosts the competitiveness of almost all Australian industries from tourism to
manufacture and mining (ironically a weak $A vs the US$ may have prevented the car makers leaving
Australia), if emerging markets weaken sharply on the flow back of funds to the US on expectations of a
higher interest rate, Australia would weaken along with Asia, as we did in the Asian crisis of the late
1990's - with Asian markets also a major outlet for manufactures by both China and Japan.

*The volume indicates likelihood that overseas money was being withdrawn from our market.

*Also, the Japan financial year ends in 10 days time.

*Sharp sell offs are 'stand aside events' except for traders. Investors with medium to long term views may
prefer to wait until the market settles.

"I will call the market down 30 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The Dow had a volatile night, trading in a large range,
with a low of 16,126, rallying at the close to about 100 points off its lows.

"The S&P 500 had about a 25 point range last night. The 1850 level of support was tested last night - it
was always going to be good support.

"Even though it had a down night the S&P 500 still closed above the 20 day moving average which is
sitting at 1858. It is at a pivotal point here. Any break and close below the 20 day moving average would
be pretty bearish again, given that it has not tested the new highs for a week. If 1858 breaks on the week
it is probably going to enter another short term downtrend.

Page96of315©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Gold got hammered for the third night. Interestingly, gold is sitting right on the very bottom of the uptrend
line that began in December/January. Any break and close below 1329 for the week could be pretty
bearish.
"Support is now at $1295 on gold.
"Interestingly copper had a small upside move, up about 3/4c and is now looking as if it may test th
e$3/lob level, a key level of resistance.

"The $A is in no man's land at the moment. It probably has downward pressure if the bond markets in the
US continue to get sold off.

"The XJO had no real technical moves yesterday although it was good it closed above 5350. It is
obviously going to fall below that today. Support is now at 5330 and below that on 5315.

"A break of 5315 today or tomorrow will see us enter into a downtrend which will be pretty bearish given
we have had an inverse head and shoulders last week and given we have not been able to break back
above the 20 day moving average as the S&P500 has done. Our XJO chart is a lot more bearish than the
S&P's.

"The 5330 and 5315 chart levels are critical.

"I will call the market down 30 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 11 points to 5355.6 last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY
Reserve bank of India permits 3 more banks to import gold
Reuters India reports India has allowed five domestic private sector banks to import gold.
India's central bank has allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank , Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd
Bank and Yes Bank, officials at the respective banks told Reuters.
India enforced the so-called 80/20 rule in July, making it mandatory to export a fifth of all gold imports.
Under that rule, only six banks and three state-run trading agencies that had facilitated export of gold or
jewellery in the past three years were allowed to import. The six banks were mostly state-run lenders.
The Reserve Bank of India - the central bank - has now permitted gold imports within prescribed limits by
the private banks even though they had not facilitated any exports of metal or jewellery in the past three
years.

*AIA/QAN/AIZ: Jetstar to pull Auckland-Singapore services

Auckland International Ltd announced it is disappointed by Jetstar's decision to suspend its
Auckland-Singapore services from July 21.

Jetstar started flying the route three years ago and announced it was suspending the route because the
service was not performing as it would have liked, and its capacity could be better put to use on other
routes.

AIA general manager Glenn Wedlock said in the report the cost of the announcement to the New Zealand
tourism industry is over $NZ70 million per year. Auckland Airport is actively working to replace the value.

He said the Jetstar announcement confirms the concerns expressed to New Zealand's Minister of
Transport, that the proposed alliance between Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand could have
detrimental impact on the growth and promotion of competition in international air services.

*MYR: Int down 8.1%, 9c ff div, no DRP, cautious s/term, longer term positive

Myer Holdings Ltd for the half year ended January 25 2014 announced a net profit down 8.1% to $80.770
million on revenue up 0.3% to $1.737 billion.

A 9c fully franked interim dividend was announced, record date March 31.

NTA backing per security is 1c vs 6c for the previous corresponding period (pcp).

Basic eps is 13.8c vs 15.1c for the pcp.

Diluted eps is 13.7c vs 15c for the pcp.
Cash in hand $76.3 million vs $179.7 million for the pcp.
CEO Bernie Brookes said in the report good progress had once again been made with the company's five
point plan. Positive comparable store sales growth achieve in the first quarter continued into the 2nd
quarter. The second quarter was characterised by weak trading during November and the first half of
December but with significant improvement immediately prior to Christmas and a very strong Stocktake
Sale.

Operating gross profit margin fell 21 basis points to 41% from 41.21% for the pcp. While there were
positive impacts from the growth of Myer Exclusive Brands, there were three key reasons for the decline in
margin. The first was the strength of the Stocktake sale and the second was the impact of the change in
the overall mix due to the increase in concession sales. The third was a strong response to loyalty
initiatives such as MYER one bonus point promotions and bounce back offers used extensively during the
Stocktake Sale.

Outlook

Given continued pressure on discretionary income and uncertain consumer sentiment, the CEO said the
company remains cautious about the trading environment for the remainder of the year.

Second half sales are expected to benefit from the completion of the refurbishment of the Adelaide store
in May 2014 and the Indooroopilly store refurbishment expected to finish in June 2014. Also the
Melbourne City store is expected to benefit from the opening of 7,000 sq m of new space within the
Emporium development adjoining the store from May 2014.

For 2015 and beyond Myer expects to benefit from a number of strategic initiative including the opening of
new stores at Joondalup in WA and Mount Gravatt in Qld in the first quarter of 2015, completion of major
refurbishment, growth in Myer Exclusive Brands and the online business.

Cost growth headwinds are also expected to moderate.

Analysts expectations: $68.6 mln, div 9.5c.

Analyst after Myer's interim report: Expects consensus EBIT downgrades

A leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Myer, saying the result was strong with profits 5/6% ahead
of its expectations with like for like sales growth higher, gross margins lower but cost growth of just 2.2%
was far lower than the broker's forecast.

"MYR had guided to 4/5% cost growth for the 2014 full year which includes a higher skew of one off costs
in the first half, hence the lower cost growth is a surprise".

The broker added gross margins were weaker than expected.
It expects consensus downgrades with Myer's current EBIT of around $174 million below consensus
EBIT of $A194 million with the broker at EBIT of $A192 million.

*ARU: Substantial cost reductions for Nolans Rare Earths Project in NT

Arafura Resources Ltd announced the results of the recent CAPEX and OPEX review for its 100% owned
Nolans Rare Earths Project in the Northern Territory has led to substantial cost savings on the August
2012 base case due to the relocation of the rare earth intermediate and rare earth separation plants and
through material improvements in and simplification of the process configuration. The initial CAPEX for the
Nolans Project now stands at $1.408 billion inclusive of indirect and owner's costs and a 15%
contingency. Indirect costs primarily relate to EPCM, specialist consultant costs and site costs.
The CAPEX excludes $A197 million of costs which Arafura has deferred by adopting selective mining
practices during the first ten years of operation.

OPEX is now estimated at $A15.67/kg REO based on annual REO equivalent production of 20,000
tonnes, a reduction of approximately 24% or $A98 million per annum on the base case, and compares
favorably with published costs from current non Chinese rare earths production.

The key reductions in OPEX result from achieving greater efficiencies in beneficiation, rare earth
extraction and separation and simplifying the supply chain.

economic impact of the cost reductions in a report during the first half of this year.
