0103 GMT [Dow Jones] Risks remain for PanAust (PNA.AU) investors that Guangdong Rising Assets
Management won't formalize its indicative A$2.30/share takeover bid for the copper, gold and silver
miner, says JP Morgan, which keeps a neutral recommendation despite the shares currently trading
below the bid price, at A$2.09. PanAust will issue a third-quarter production report next month, by which
time it expects discussions with Guangdong Rising or other potential suitors to have advanced
significantly. "Whilst not a definitive line in the sand, we believe it is a positive in terms of signaling the
process is drawing closer to a definitive conclusion," the broker says. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

0058 GMT [Dow Jones] The New Zealand economic recovery cycle has peaked and "economic growth
will moderate but remain positive," according to the latest consensus forecasts from the NZ Institute of
Economic Research. The forecasts are an average compiled from a survey of financial and economy
agencies. According to the forecasts, economic growth will moderate from 3.3% in the March 2015 year
to 2.9% and 2.2% in the following two years. It will grow 1.9% in 2018. Inflation is tipped to rise from 1.6%
in 2015 to 2.2% in 2018--still comfortably within the central bank's 1% to 3% target band. Interest rates
"will eventually rise." The floating mortgage rate is currently around 6.75% and could rise to 8.0% by
early 2018, according to the consensus forecasts. They also indicated NZD will "gradually ease" from its
current highs in 2015 but "the level remains high compared to history." (rebecca.howard@wsj.com;

0055 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 falls 1% to a 5-week low of 5478.2, on track for its
biggest fall in 5 weeks, after weak Chinese economic data and a further selloff in U.S. bonds and
equities ahead of Wednesdays' FOMC meeting. "There are hopes of further stimulus by China's
Government, but China is constrained by a need to rebalance its economy away from property and
credit-fuelled growth," CMC chief market strategist Ric Spooner says. "While weaker than expected data
from China will have investors cautious about resource stocks, a falling A$ could easily see ongoing
weakness in the banks as offshore investors head for the exits...there may also be some concern about
the implications...for the broader Australian economy." China growth concern comes as the market is
already suffering from rising U.S. bond yields as QE ends and the Fed moves closer to interest rate
hikes. Among high-yield equities, major banks, Telstra (TLS.AU) and Transurban (TCL.AU) fall
0.9%-1.2%. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0005 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 remains vulnerable before the FOMC meeting
concludes Wednesday, with the S&P 500 down 0.6% on Friday. High-yield equities are likely to stay
under pressure after U.S. 10-year bond yields rose 5 basis points to 2.61% as improving U.S. retail sales
and consumer confidence fuelled expectations that the Fed could emphasise the strengthening
economy, as a precursor to an earlier-than-expected interest rate increase. Materials stocks could also
be vulnerable after China's industrial production, retail sales and fixed assets investment data missed
expectations over the weekend. Smaller iron ore mining companies may be weighed down by

raising. However, offshore income earners may outperform after the Australian dollar dived to a 6-month
low of 0.9003. Index last 5524.1. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2341 GMT [Dow Jones] The most contentious issue for markets is the currency arrangement for Scotland
if they were to become independent, says Harbour Asset Management in Wellington in a morning report.
The latest polls suggest the "yes" campaign is just behind in the polls "creating the real chance of an
upset result that ends the United Kingdom's 300 years of political union." It notes GBP would be the first
source of volatility on any Scottish news and a "yes" vote "could spark a run on Scottish based banks, as
depositors seek to resolve uncertainty by relocating their funds south of the border." This has the "scope
to temporarily disrupt the global interbank funding markets." While a surprise win by the "yes" campaign
"may trigger an immediate flight to safety and spike in global market volatility, a successful package of
transition measures could make this a more manageable wobble for markets," it adds.

2336 GMT[Dow Jones] Westpac Bank expects New Zealand's 2Q GDP growth to slow to 0.7% after
three straight quarters of growth of 1% or more. "High-level economic indicators such as business
confidence have softened since the start of the year, but only to levels that are more consistent with trend
growth," it says. It adds that the softening has largely been in the export-oriented primary sectors with
falling dairy and log prices prompting a drop in production. On the flip side, growth in
domestically-oriented sectors remained robust, it says. The median of a poll of 10 economists is for 2Q
GDP to be +0.6% and 3.8% on the year. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)

2313 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to trade in a lower range near term after hitting a
three-session high of $93.67/bbl on Friday but settling down 56 cents at $92.27/bbl, Dow Jones technical
analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the five- and 15-day moving averages are
declining, but the daily slow stochastic indicator is bullish. Support is at $90.43 (16-month low hit on
Thursday); a breach would target $90.11 (May 1, 2013, reaction low), then the psychological $90.00 line,
$87.55 (April 22, 2013, low) and $85.61 (April 18, 2013, swing low). But a rise above the $93.67
resistance would tilt the near-term view positive, targeting $93.94 (Tuesday's high, near the middle
20-day Bollinger Band), then $94.99 (Sept. 5 high), $95.39 (Sept. 4 high), $95.83 (Sept. 3 high) and
$96.00 (Aug. 29 high). October crude is down 47 cents at $91.80/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2243 GMT [Dow Jones] Don't discount the prospect of Australian central bank interest rate cuts just yet,
says Credit-Suisse equity strategist Hasan Tevfik. He lists many reasons to be cautious about consumer
demand, among them are falling real wages; fragility in the job market expressed through a preference to
hire part-time workers; and cost-of-living increases. He expects to see the cost-of-living squeeze weigh
on consumer spending, dragging aggregate demand growth lower. "More policy stimulus is necessary.
We expect to see policy makers downgrade their growth and inflation forecasts. The RBA is likely to cut
rates further, in our view," he added. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
2246 GMT [Dow Jones] Europe's Brent oil benchmark prices could end the year higher, according to a
survey of energy investors by International Strategy & Investment Group LLC, but U.S. West Texas
crude prices aren't expected to move much. Nearly 59% of respondents thought a barrel of Brent oil
would end 2014 between $100 and $110 a barrel; on Friday, it closed at a 52-week low of $97.11 a
barrel. By comparison. 52% of respondents believed U.S. West Texas benchmark crude would end the
year between $90 and $95 a barrel; it closed on Friday at $92.27 a barrel. A plurality of respondents
(42.7%) predicted U.S. natural gas prices would be between $4 and $4.50 per million British thermal
units in 2016. It closed at $3.86 per million BTUs on Friday.(russell.gold@wsj.com;@russellgold)

2238 GMT[Dow Jones] Payment plans for the iPhone 6 are out, and Telstra (TLS.AU) has maintained its
status as the most expensive handset and service provider, according to Credit Suisse, which says it's
charging a 14%-32% premium to Optus and a 30%-40% premium to Vodafone Australia across various
plans. Telstra, however, has offered customers on its high-end A$95/month plan a subsidy, wiping the
A$10/month handset fee it had charged for the iPhone 5S. "Overall, we remain of the view that mobile
pricing competition has taken a significant step up following a period of relative stability," Credit Suisse
says. The broker is forecasting Telstra mobile revenue growth of only 0.5% in both FY15 and FY16 due
to the increased competition. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2241 GMT [Dow Jones] Commentary about the Australian dollar in Tuesday's Australian central bank
policy meeting minutes will be the thing to watch for this week, says Kieran Davies, chief economist at
Barclays, Australia. Recent weakness in the Australian dollar in the face of a rising U.S. dollar has seen it
break down out of a tight range held since March. "The bank's fair value model suggests that the
exchange rate is still significantly overvalued given the recent drop in commodity prices...we imagine that
the bank would be hoping that the slide continues," Mr. Davies said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter
