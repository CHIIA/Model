The latest alumina tender issued by BHP Billiton from the Worsley alumina refinery in Western Australia
has a number of features that are more commonly found on online auction and shopping website Ebay.
BHP is offering 30,000 tonnes of alumina from Worsley in a tender that is scheduled to end at 14:00 GMT
on Friday March 14. For the first time, the company has included what it calls a BMAG price in its tender
offer. The BMAG price is a price at which buyers can bid to immediately stop the tender process and
secure the material. "We are introducing a new feature in the Invitation to Bid, a 'BMAG price' which gives
[BHP] the right to stop the bidding process and award the sale to the first bidder to bid the 'BMAG price',"
the company said in its invitation email, seen by Metal Bulletin.

Several traders have said that the BMAG price very closely resembles Ebay's "buy-it-now" option, which
gives bidders on auctions the chance to similarly halt the process by bidding a higher price set by the
seller. "It's exactly like Ebay," one trader said. One slight difference, however, is that the BMAG price has
been falling throughout the week. "It was $327 [per tonne] on Tuesday, $325 on Wednesday, $322 on
Thursday, and now it's at $321," the trader said. Will it work? Some sources have questioned the tactic,
saying there are not enough buyers to justify such a move. "Ebay lives because it has millions of
customers. Alumina has got ten serious producers and only a few independent buyers - 90% of its
customers are in China," a second trader said, adding that there is a supply surplus in alumina at the
moment. "I have people offering alumina every day, but there are no buyers. All consumers have full
silos," he said. But markets can turn quickly, and having the option to guarantee securing tender volumes
may become very attractive to buyers in the future. BHP has also set a reserve price on the tender of $315
per tonne, below which it will not sell the offered material, sources said. Ebay also has a similar feature
when people offer goods through its auctions. <a
