SYDNEY-- Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. said it hoped to repay as much as US$1.5 billion of debt within
the next year, after a sharp rise in iron-ore output from its Pilbara mines fueled a 56% jump in annual
profit.

Fortescue also maintained its final dividend at 10 cents a share, soothing investor concerns that the
world's No. 4 iron-ore exporter by volume might look to lower payouts to free up cash to repay loans.

In its decadelong quest to break the dominance of Vale SA, Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Billiton Ltd. in
iron-ore output, Fortescue built a vast network of land holdings and infrastructure in Australia's remote
Pilbara region--using loans totaling billions of dollars. With that expansion now complete, Fortescue has
seen a sharp improvement in cash flow that's strengthening its ability to bring its debt down.

However, the Perth-based miner is also more vulnerable than its more diversified rivals to sudden falls in
the price of iron ore, a key ingredient in steel. Rising iron-ore supply, particularly from the Pilbara, has
contributed to iron-ore prices falling by around a third this year.

"It is a matter of maintaining the balance--recognizing that our shareholders need to be rewarded along
the way [while] maintaining a very, very sharp focus on debt repayment," Fortescue Chief Executive Nev
Power told reporters.
Fortescue on Wednesday reported a net profit of US$2.73 billion in the year through June as rising
production offset the fall in iron-ore prices. Earlier this year, the company reached a long-held target of
155 million tons of annual iron-ore output in the Pilbara.
Cash flow more than doubled to US$6.25 billion, while Fortescue's net debt totaled US$7.2 billion as of
June 30, compared with US$8.6 billion six months earlier.
Fortescue plans to increase its dividend to 30%-40% of earnings once it gets its debt-to-equity level
down to a 40% target set by management. Its payout the last fiscal year equated to around a fifth of
earnings.
To meet the debt-to-equity target, Fortescue said it would need to pay down another US$2 billion to
US$2.5 billion. This should happen within the next two years, Mr. Power said.
Fortescue repaid US$3.1 billion of debt during the past fiscal year, and management said it would repay
senior notes worth US$500 million in October. In addition, the company plans to pay back another
US$500 million to US$1 billion depending on iron-ore prices.
Major miners including Rio Tinto have also reported record iron-ore output from the Pilbara, where the
companies think they can produce the commodity more cheaply than other countries such as China.

Fortescue--which over the past decade has grown from a tiny explorer to one of the world's biggest
miners of iron ore--exported 124.2 million tons of iron ore during the year, an increase of 54%.
Fortescue expects to ship as much as 29% more iron ore to buyers in countries including China over the
coming year after completing the expansion of its Australian operations.

previously. The company expects continued migration to the cities from China's countryside to fuel
demand for new infrastructure, factories and housing.
