Clyde Agriculture, a subsidiary of the UK-based Swire Group, has sold its last rural properties in
Australia, Beemery, Janbeth and Latoka to interests associated with the Harris family for what is
believed to be as much as $50 million.
Swire Group chief operating officer Greg Hughes confirmed the transaction. "We have exchanged
contracts and expect a normal settlement process and timeline," Mr Hughes said from Hong Kong.

As foreshadowed in The Australian Financial Review in March, the Harris family will buy the
properties after finalising the $32 million sale of their South Ravensworth farm at Murrumbidgee,
NSW to listed agriculture and water company Tandou.

Totalling well over 30,000 hectares at Bourke in western NSW, the three Clyde properties have
extensive irrigation development. Janbeth has about 12,800 megalitres of water licences on the
Darling River and Beemery, at last count, had over 8000 megalitres of water licences from the
Barwon River. Cliff Brown from Moree Real Estate negotiated the deal.
The Harrises were unavailable for comment and Mr Hughes declined to comment on the sale price
or any commercial terms associated with the deal.

"We obviously wish the Harrises many safe, happy and prosperous seasons and thank our wonderful
team of employees and their families for everything they have contributed to Clyde," Mr Hughes said.

The original Clyde portfolio included more than 270,000 hectares of prime grazing and irrigation
country in NSW and Queensland worth an estimated $300 million.

Rural investors such as the family behind Bell Potter Securities and one of Australia's best rural
property portfolios, the Bells, and the Qatar Investment Authority's Hassad FoodGroup, have been
major buyers of the Clyde portfolio.
The recent sale of the Harris family's south Ravensworth farm included more than 34,500 megalitres
of water entitlements and 7450 hectares of land.READ NEXT: Optimistic cattle market's $200m sale
