THE statement from China’s Baosteel and Brisbane-based Aurizon late yesterday was blunt and
triggered an immediate 12 per cent slump in takeover target Aquila’s share price.
The suitors would not boost their $1.4 billion takeover bid for the West Australian iron ore miner, or
extend the $3.40 a share offer.

What’s more they threatened to walk away from the deal entirely. Aquila shares surged as high as
$3.77 on Wednesday after Mineral Resources bought a near $200 million, 13 per cent stake at $3.75
a share.
Perth-based Mineral Resources wants to deal itself in to Aquila’s stalled $7.4 billion West Pilbara
iron ore project.
The market had speculated that the Chinese steelmaker and Aurizon would have to boost their offer
to stay in the hunt. But Aquila’s shares slumped 44¢ to $3.10 yesterday after Baosteel chairman Dai
Zhihao threatened to dump his company’s 19.8 per cent stake in Aquila and any involvement in the
West Pilbara project.

“If the bid is unsuccessful ... Baosteel sees no meaningful prospect for being involved in the (project),’’
he said.

“In those circumstances Baosteel ... would have to carefully consider their ongoing shareholding in
Aquila.” Aurizon CEO Lance Hockridge said Aquila shareholders should take into account that iron
ore prices have declined about 15 per cent since the joint bid was announced last month.Analysts say
Aquila chairman Tony Poli will have to think twice about the logic of holding onto his 30 per cent
shareholding for a better offer.
