SOUTH African developer Resource Generation has negotiated a new $US65 million ($72.9m) loan
with Hong Kong trader Noble Group to fund its coal development.
The Australian-listed company said yesterday that together with existing cash resources the loan
facility would be used for constructing buildings and infrastructure at its Boikarabelo mine.
``Completing these loan arrangements removes the remaining major gap in our funding plans,''
managing director Paul Jury said.

``Funding discussions for the purchase or lease of mobile equipment are at an advanced stage with
three parties.''

The loan is in addition to a previously announced $US55.3m loan from Noble for constructing a rail
link from the Boikarabelo mine to the existing transnet freight rail network. A $US123m loan facility
with Noble, reduced to $US67.7m because of the rail link loan, expired on December 31 without any
drawdowns having occurred.

Resource Generation said the change with the loan facilities enabled greater flexibility in finalising
remaining funding discussions.
Mr Jury said yesterday that discussions were continuing for obtaining project finance for the coal
handling and preparation plant.

``Once these remaining discussions are complete, the main funding for the construction of
Boikarabelo will be in place,'' he said.
The $US480m project is targeting an initial annual output of six million tonnes and is slated to start
producing next year.
The company also announced yesterday that it had received a payment of $2.5m from investor
Blumont Group, which was meant to pay the junior $22.5m by December 4.
