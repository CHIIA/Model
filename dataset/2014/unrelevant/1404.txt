The sharemarket ended the week on a negative note in thin trading after global equity markets started
2014 lower following disappointing Chinese factory activity data.

On Friday, the S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 18.2 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5349.7 in a broad selloff that
included the biggest banking and resource stocks. Over the week, the benchmark index rose 0.4 per
cent, with metals and mining stocks leading the gains.

Price movements were exaggerated by low volumes as the total value of shares traded over the week
was about $956 million, compared with an average weekly turnover of about $3.64 billion in the first
three weeks of December.

Overseas markets dropped on Thursday after major indices in the US, Europe and Asia fell after
China's National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index dipped 0.4 per cent in December to
51 points, its lowest reading in four months, indicating a contraction in global demand.

"Another issue that could be providing investors with some pause is rising 10-year US bond yields,
currently around 3 per cent," CMC Markets analyst Ric Spooner said. "One of the key issues for
markets over coming months will be whether the US Federal Reserve can exit from its quantitative
easing strategy without pushing bond yields too high and so dampening the outlook for economic and
profit growth."

Three of the big banks lost ground on Friday, with Commonwealth Bank down 0.3 per cent at $77.58,
NAB off 0.4 per cent at $34.69 and ANZ dipping 1¢ to $32.21. Westpac was unchanged at $32.34.

An HSBC proxy for the International Monetary Fund's primary commodity price index reported that
global commodity prices increased 3.5 per cent in US-dollar terms during December, and were up 2.4
per cent in 2013.
"Higher energy prices provided a boost, with oil and natural gas prices rising in 2013, while cereals
were a key area of weakness," HSBC economist Adam Richardson said.
At the close on Friday, the dollar was buying US89.86¢, up from US89.13¢. Energy stocks were mostly
lower after crude oil prices dipped on news Libya is to reopen a big oilfield, increasing global supply.
Santos lost 0.8 per cent to $14.56, while Australia's biggest oil producer, Woodside Petroleum,
dropped 1.1 per cent to $38.13. On Thursday the company announced it had lost a multibillion-dollar
contract to sell LNG to Japan.

BHP Billiton fell 1.1 per cent to $37.77, while Rio Tinto lost 0.5 per cent to $68.36, and Fortescue
Metals dropped 1.9 per cent to $5.82 as surface mining resumed at its Christmas Creek project four
days after a man was killed in an accident while working at the site.

shareholders accept an off-market takeover from Chinese-owned Wealth Mining for 45.5¢ a share.

Silver Lake Resources was the best-performing stock for the second day in a row, climbing 8.7 per cent
to 69¢ as the spot price of gold rose to $US1231.05 an ounce.

Cabcharge dropped 3.5 per cent to $3.87 after the Victorian Taxi Services Commission announced on
Thursday the surcharge for paying a fare by credit or debit card would drop from 10 per cent to 5 per
cent from next month.
