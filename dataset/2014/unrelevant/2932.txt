Analysts at UBS have increased their share price target on Rio Tinto, after the group released
impressive fourth-quarter production data. UBS now has a 12-month price target on the stock of
between $80 and $90, and has substantially upgraded its forward earnings forecasts on the group.

The revised price target represents a premium of nearly 40 per cent to Rio's last closing price of
$65.58.

Deutsche Bank has a 12-month price target of $86 on the stock, while Morgan Stanley is more
bearish, with a target of $66.

However, Morgan Stanley also said the production gave it hope there could be "some upside" to its
existing earnings projections.
UBS highlighted that production exceeded 2013 guidance in all commodities apart from uranium and
semi-soft coking coal, with the former well expected following Energy Resources of Australia's leach
tank failure. Rio Tinto has a 70 per cent stake in the ASX-listed Energy Resources of Australia.
Copper and iron ore provided the most significant momentum towards the end of 2013, with full-year
copper production of 632,000 tonnes well above UBS estimates of 618,000 tonnes, and company
guidance of 590,000 tonnes. Global iron ore production of 266 million tonnes was just ahead of
company guidance.
Rio Tinto's future is closely aligned with the iron ore industry. UBS's take on the industry is that
increasing supply could weigh on the long-run iron ore price, but as the lowest-cost producer Rio will
be the most competitive player in that sector.
However, in the immediate term iron ore prices are expected to remain relatively robust, with UBS
noting supply from Brazil had been weak. The broker also upwardly revised its near-term copper price
assumptions after China's trading activity strengthened.

On the back of the production report and after considering currency and commodity price adjustments,
analysts atUBS upgraded underlying earnings per share forecasts for 2014 and 2015 by 18 per cent
and 15 per cent respectively. This sees the company trading on forward price-earnings multiples of
8.5 and 7.6 respectively – substantially lower than long-term averages, and making the company
appear decidedly good value in a tricky sector.$11bn earnings expected

After the fourth-quarter production report, UBS has crunched the numbers and expects Rio to deliver
underlying earnings of $US9.8 billion ($11.12 billion) for the 12 months to December 31, 2013.This
would imply a price-earnings multiple of 10.7 relative to the company's current trading range. If this
multiple were applied to revised 2015 forecasts it would represent a share price in the vicinity of UBS's
target price, suggesting that this may be close to the mark.
