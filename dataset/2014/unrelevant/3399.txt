Quadrant Private Equity has appointed Morgans to handle the retail offering for the coming IPO of
APN Outdoor.
UBS and Morgan Stanley were named joint lead managers of the float last month.

Chief executive Richard Herring is on the final leg of a non-deal roadshow, after presenting to
investors in Sydney, Melbourne and Hong Kong. It is believed formal analyst marketing could be
under way by the end of the month, with the company well on track to be listed by the end of the
year.

Former News Corporationexecutive Doug Flynn left the board of Seven West Media earlier this month
to chair APN Outdoor.
Quadrant is hoping the market will value APN Outdoor at around $500 million, which reflects a
multiple of around 10 times earnings.
The company is tracking ahead of its earnings forecasts for 2014, benefiting from its investment in
digital signs, which can carry several advertisements on one billboard and rotate inventory.
