China:
The world's largest sourcing and logistics firm Li & Feng (0494.HK), whose earnings is an indicator of
the retail sectors in US and Europe, said that its first-half revenue rose only 3% from a year ago, and
warned that brands it worked with were "delaying order decisions until they get better indications about
consumer confidence." Retail sector growth in the developed countries remain tepid.

China's fifth largest bank Bank of Communications (3328.HK), which HSBC (HSBC) has a 19% stake
in, said its first-half net profit rose only 6% from a year ago, the slowest pace since 2009. The bank also
said it wanted to be China's first listed bank to offer stock incentives to employees to push for more
operational efficiency. It is a delicate walk between profitability and systemic risk.

Japan:

SoftBank (9984.T) may well not be done with acquisitions just yet, even after it scrapped a merger
between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). The company is seeking to raise $4 billion from bond sales.
Bloomberg reports:
Yahoo would fit that category, said Atlantis Investment Research Corp. Taking a stake in messaging
service Line Corp. is another option for the Tokyo-based mobile-phone operator, according to Thornburg
Investment Management Inc. Already the biggest shareholder in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., SoftBank
could team up with the e-commerce company, or buy a movie maker or news service, said SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. Abelian Research said the $85 billion company may even consider tucking Dish into its
fold to better compete with the likes of AT&T Inc.

Korea's Naver Corp. (035420.KS) owns Line. At the open, SoftBank gained 0.7%. Mobile gaming
company Gungho (3765.T), which SoftBank has a stake in, jumped 5.6%.

Two weeks ago, SoftBank posted a 68% drop in second-quarter profit but it was mostly due to temporary
mark-to-market accounting on its stake in Alibaba Group (BABA), which will be reversed once Alibaba
goes public.

Indonesia:

Indonesia's Constitutional Court upheld President-elect Joko Widodo's electoral win. But Widodo still
does not have a majority in the Parliament.

Australia:

Australia's largest banks posted record earnings as they benefited from low benchmark interest rates (at
2.5%), but are bracing for slower growth.
Australian energy firmSantos Ltd. (STO.AX) raised its dividend for the first time in four years, after its
net profit slipped 24% from an Indonesian asset write-down. Santos rose 3.6% at the open.
