One of the Melbourne's more enduring family-owned development companies has lodged plans for a
soaring 80-level city skyscraper, adding to the long list of 43 proposals to be considered by whatever
party forms government after the election.

Local developer Brady Group, which has been building units in the city for more than 25 years, is
banking on continued heat in the apartment market, submitting a proposal for a thin, 220-metre tower
on a relatively small 1290-square-metre site at 280 Queen Street.
The three-storey, rendered brick office building on the site partially leased to Kliger Partners Lawyers
will be demolished to make way for a $150 million tower with a blue curtain wall finish and 589
apartments.

The majority of dwellings - 287 - will have two bedrooms, with 242 one bedders and 36 three-bedroom
apartments. The tower will also have 14 penthouses on its top levels.
The property was purchased by Chinese national Xuebin Wu for $23.9 million last year.
Mr Wu holds a third portion of the holding company which lodged the plans for the site, suggesting
an initial joint capital venture with, or buyout, by Brady. A Brady spokesman said Mr Wu was no longer
involved in the project.
