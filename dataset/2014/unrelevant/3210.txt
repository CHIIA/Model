*The IMF has sharply increased its growth forecast for the UK economy to growth of 2.4% in 2014 vs up
1.9% expected earlier.

The IMF also raised its global growth outlook slightly to 3.7%.

The world's largest economy, the US, is expected to grow by 2.8% this year, an improvement on the
previous estimate of 2.6% that the IMF made in October.

It expects the euro area as a whole to grow by 1%. "The euro area is turning a corner from recession to
recovery," the IMF said. However, it added the pickup would be weaker in economies that have been
facing "financial stress", namely Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Italy and Portugal.
The IMF also upgraded its forecast for the Chinese economy to 7.5% this year.

But it also warned that "strengthening global growth does not mean that the global economy is out of the
woods".

*BHP: Record prod across 10 operations, full yr prod guidance maintained
BHP Billiton reported production records across 10 operations and three commodities. Full year
production guidance was maintained for the Petroleum (approximately 250 Mboe of oil equivalent),
Copper (guidance for full year unchanged at 1.7 Mt, although the group's equity interest is .2 Mt). Iron
Ore (guidance for full year unchanged at 192 million tonnes) and Coal Businesses (Metallurgical coal
production guidance retained at 41 million tonnes for 2014, total coal guidance unchanged at 73 million
tonnes). *Western Australia iron ore achieved record production of 108 million tonnes on a 100% basis
for the December 2013 half year, or up 19% net to BHP of 97,829Kt. Queensland Coal achieved record
production for the December 2013 half year, with annualised production increasing to 68 million tonnes on
a 100% basis in the December quarter.
Metallurgical coal attributable to BHP was up 22% to 21,725Kt for the half year and up 30-% to 11,540 Kt
fort he December quarter vs the pcp.
Energy coal was down 1% to 37,406Kt for the half year and down 5% to 17,767Kt for the quarter.
Petroleum liquids production increased by 9% to 50 million barrels of oil equivalent in the December 2013
half year, underpinned by a 72% increase in onshore US.

Attributable to BHP total petroleum products for the December half was down 1% to 120.4 Mboe and down
1% to 57.7Mboe for the quarter.

All projects are on schedule and on budget.
Alumina production was up 8% to 2,603Kt for the half year and up 10% to 1,352Kt for the December

billion as planned.

CEO Andrew Mackenzie said in the report production and volumes are expected to grow by 16% over the
two years to the end of the 2015 financial year. Iron ore and metallurgical coal production were
particularly strong and are very well positioned to achieve guidance notwithstanding the general
uncertainty that exists as the wet season approaches.
Full year production guidance was retained for the Petroleum, Copper, Iron Ore and Coal businesses.

main London-listed peers, Rio Tinto and Anglo American, is its petroleum division, which accounted for
20% of its revenue and 27% of its earnings in 2012/13.

"Nearly half of BHP’s petroleum production comes from its US onshore shale fields, and having looked at
BHP’s 2012/13 results, it’s these shale assets that concern me.

"Shale wells have relatively low outputs and short lifespans, compared to conventional wells. This means
you need to drill a lot of them, every year, to maintain or grow production from shale fields such as BHP’s
Eagle Ford and Permian acreage.

"In 2012/13, BHP spent $4.8bn drilling and developing US onshore wells, using around 40 drilling rigs.
"Output from BHP’s US onshore fields during the same period was 99.2 million barrels of oil equivalent
(mmboe). Using the company’s reported figures and average prices obtained for natural gas and crude
production, this equates to around $3.8bn — $1bn less than was spent on drilling and development.

"Admittedly some of last year’s capex will bear fruit in the years to come, but the problem with shale wells
is that they constantly need to be replenished; BHP is planning to spend a further $3.9bn on its onshore
US fields in 2013/14.

"Making a profit from US shale fields isn’t necessarily as easy as it seems. Earlier this year, Royal Dutch
Shell recorded a $2.1bn impairment on its US shale assets, which it is trying to sell.
"BHP is planning to focus on liquids-rich acreage this year, which should help matters, as oil prices remain
fairly high by historical standards. However, even a focus on liquids may not be sufficient — BHP’s sold its
oil last year for an average of $106 per barrel. Oil prices have fallen in recent months, and West Texas
Intermediate, the US benchmark that’s equivalent to Brent, currently sells for less than $95 per barrel.

"The $5.7bn profit delivered by BHP’s petroleum division last year was generated by its offshore assets,
the majority of which are in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Australia.
"In my view, the firm’s foray into shale is diluting the high quality of its offshore petroleum assets, and
adding risk that looks unlikely to provide appropriate returns".

Chinese brokerage GF Financial Markets joins LME ring dealer members
FastMarkets reported last night Chinese brokerage GF Financial Makets joined the ring dealer members,
seen as a signal that LME open outcry trading has a future beyond 2015, which was guaranteed by Hong
Kong Exchange & Clearing Ltd bought the LME in 2012.

GF Financial had purchased 100% of UK Natixis Commoditeis Markets Ltd last year, and hired the bulk of
the experienced floor trading team from outgoing RDM Jefferies Bache.

FastMarkets said most of the floor traders for GF Financial are familiar faces to the ring trading community.
Their advent brought the number of ring traders back to 11. There are hopes other Chinese firms may join.
RDM members have fallen from some 30 companies in the 1980s.

The LME Ring is the only open outcry floor in Europe. Its members re the only ones entitled to trade in the
open outcry floor as well ast he electronic platform, they can issue LME contracts and are also members of
the clearing house, FastMarkets reports.
Nickel, zinc top picks for 2014, copper may struggle, iron ore may fall 21% - GS
FastMarkets reported Goldman Sachs has identified nickel and zinc as the mining commodities with the
most upside on a 12 month view, lifting its nickel price target to $14,500 per tonne over three months,
415,000 over six months and $16,000 over 12 months, up from $3,500, $14,500 and $15,000 respectively.

The brokerage said there is a significant probability that Indonesia will now ease the processing thresholds
on exported nickel material which could see the price spike to around $18,000/20,000 it added.

Goldman remains bullish on zinc due to falling supply, keeping its price forecasts unchanged at $2,000
over three months, $2,050 over six months and $2,300 over 12 months.

It forecast further increases next year and in 2016, raising its 2016 and 2017 LME price forecasts to
$2,300 from $2,200.
Goldman Sachs has moderated its very near term copper bearishness due to recent major supply
disruptions including the halt in Indonesian ore shipments and the Chilean port strike as well as lower
inventory visibility because of the new LME rules and an increase in Chinse copper financing deals. It
lifted its 3 month forecast by $400 to$7,000.
Goldman remained cautious on aluminium, expecting a continued increase in Chinese supply, lowering its
three moth price forecast to $1,700 from $1,800 and the six month forecast also to $1,700 while lifting the
12 month forecast by $50 to $1,750.
