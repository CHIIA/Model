Game Site Gree Looks to Hotel Bookings for Growth

TOKYO--Japanese mobile-game developer Gree Inc. is hoping a foray into the hotel-booking business
can help restore profits hit by declining sales of products linked to its games.
Gree's entry into hotel-reservation apps is part of a larger fight for a share of Japan's Yen15 trillion
($148 billion) domestic travel market, which is benefiting from a revival in the nation's economy. In the
Japanese market, online-services companyRakuten Inc.'s travel site and Recruit Holdings Co.'s Jalan
site currently control about 60% of hotel bookings made via online travel agents, according to market
research firm PhoCusWright Japan.

Earlier this month, Gree invested $4.5 million in Hong Kong-based HotelQuickly, a mobile app that
offers last-minute hotel rooms at discounted prices. Gree hopes HotelQuickly will help operations of its
own booking app, Tonight, launched in Japan last month.

Representatives of Rakuten and Recruit declined to comment on Gree's move but said they have long
offered last-minute booking discounts.
Other websites seeking growth in Japan include Germany-based Hotel Reservation Service and
Australia's HotelsCombined, both of which recently introduced Japanese-language sites. The
Japanese-language site of Expedia Inc., the global market leader, has offered last-minute booking
services for several years.

Despite the heavy competition, Gree says it still sees opportunity. Its executives say some rival
smartphone apps are still clunky or, in the case of foreign sites, don't necessarily allow the kind of
specifications to which Japanese travelers are accustomed.
"We have until the end of this year" to become the go-to site for last-minute hotel bookings, said Gree
Vice President Eiji Araki.
Currently, 90% of Gree's profits come from games. But the company's net profit is projected to have
dipped 11% in the year through June compared with the same period a year earlier and profit is down
almost 60% from two years earlier. That is because customers are spending less on in-game
purchases of items to help players advance, and Gree was late to switch its focus to smartphone apps
from games for an earlier generation of mobile phones.
The company's stock price is less than half of its peak, and some analysts say it looks like it is grasping
for new ideas without a clear strategy. Among the company's recent ventures are a website for users
who want to resell their purses, a $50 million fund for Asian Internet companies and a beauty-pageant
app that lets participants root for an actual woman to become the app's "No. 1 Princess."

Mr. Araki said the diversity of business ideas showed Gree was returning to its roots as a provider of a
variety of Internet services. After releasing what it touts as the world's first mobile social game, "Fishing
Star" in 2007, Gree focused on that business and became known as a game company.

The eighth floor of the building in which Gree is housed has become an incubation center with teams of
three to five people working on projects they hope will become the company's next growth pillar.

now."
