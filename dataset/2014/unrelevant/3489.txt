SINGAPOREAN investment giant GIC Real Estate has moved to capitalise on the Asian investment
boom by putting one of Sydney’s best towers with residential conversion potential on the block in a
$300 million play.
The group has called for submissions on 175 Liverpool Street from real estate agencies as it lures
both Asian groups that are prepared to buy office towers and hold them for some years before
developing them and mainland Chinese players who are chasing quicker starts.

The north-facing tower is one of the city’s best redevelopment opportunities and offers Hyde Park
views. It could be transformed into an apartment development that may even surpass the $600m
complex being undertaken by Chinese giant Greenland Holdings Group on the former Sydney Water
Board site.

There are few comparable opportunities available in the city, with only AMP Capital’s offer of 338 Pitt
Street — on which a 50-storey scheme has been worked up — on the market at over $100m through
CBRE and Savills at the moment. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC, picked up the Liverpool
Street office block for $125m in 1996 and has since built a multi-billion-dollar portfolio of office towers,
shopping centres, hotels and stakes in listed companies.
But it has moved to cash in on interest from Chinese players who have set the pace in buying assets
in recent months. Notably, it sold the Park Hyatt Melbourne to China’s Fu Wah International Group
through CBRE for about $135m after a decade of ownership.
GIC owns about $4 billion worth of real estate in Australia, including Chifley Tower and the Queen
Victoria Building in Sydney.
It also owns an 11.64 per cent stake in GPT Group.
GIC last year started fielding approaches from Chinese developers on the Liverpool Street tower,
which is also one of the city’s best office assets.The tower includes 28 upper office levels with a net
lettable area of about 46,320sq m. GIC is also converting a mid-rise plant room into two more office
floors.
