HEALTH ■ $7 charge to see the GP, have a blood test or an X-ray ■ New $20b medical research fund
■ Extra $5 charge for prescriptions and an extra 80c for pensioners ■ $2b cut from public hospitals ■
Public dental funding cut by $390m THE VERDICT Ouch! That’s gonna hurt. Get set to pay $7 more to
visit the GP, although most of the money will go to a medical research investment fund. Still stings,
doesn’t it?

JOBS AND SKILLS ■ $10,000 payment to companies who employ someone aged over 50 ■
Unemployment rate forecast of 6.25 per cent in 2014-15, dropping to 5.75 per cent in 2017-18 ■
Apprentices will lose funding under Tools for Trade program THE VERDICT Everyone who can work,
must now work. In that spirit, the Government will pay employers a $10,000 bonus for employing older
workers.

WELFARE ■ Unemployed under 25 will get Youth Allowance, not Newstart, making it harder to stay on
welfare ■ People under 30 will wait six months before getting unemployment benefits and have to work
for the dole THE VERDICT Those under 30 will have to earn, learn or work for the dole. Joe Hockey
wants a nation of “lifters, not leaners”. Let’s hope there’s enough jobs to go around.

EDUCATION ■ Universities can set their own tuition fees from 2016 ■ New Trade Support Loans up to
$20,000 will be offered for a four-year apprenticeship ■ Students will have to pay back HELP debt
sooner, with the income threshold dropped to $50,638 THE VERDICT Let’s hope uni students put their
time to good use. Graduates will be charged higher interest on their HELP debts and repayments cut in
when they earn just over $50,000.

70 from 2035 ■ Untaxed super included in the income test for Seniors Health Card ■ Annual Seniors
Supplement will be abolished from July 1, 2014 ■ Pensions will be indexed to CPI, not wages, from
September 2017 THE VERDICT Those golden years just lost some of their shine. From 2017, pension
rises will only compensate for inflation and won’t keep pace with wages. Better start saving now.

ECONOMY ■ $49.9b Budget deficit this year, dropping to $29.8b next year and $2.8b in 2017-18 ■
Surplus of 1 per cent of GDP expected by 2024-25 ■ $197b net debt in 2013-14 ■ $264b expected net
debt in 2017-18 THE VERDICT Our mining boom is over and we can’t rely on foreigners to fund our
future. The economy will grow below trend until the next election.

TAXATION ■ New temporary debt tax of 2 per cent for people earning more than $180,000 a year ■
Company tax cut of 1.5 per cent for about 800,000 businesses ■ Smokers will pay an extra 6.5 cents
per packet of cigarettes ■ Company tax increase of 1.5 per cent for top 3000 firms to fund the Paid
Parental Leave scheme THE VERDICT Call it what you will, the “temporary Budget repair levy” is a
new tax on high earners; 2 per cent of all they earn over $180,000.
FAMILES ■ Family Tax Benefit Part B will stop when the youngest child turns six; income threshold
drops to $100,000 ■ A family receiving Part A will see payments drop when income reaches $94,316

capped at $50,000 from July 1, 2015 THE VERDICT Hold on to your hip pockets. Families will feel the
pain with payments frozen for two years. Those on incomes above $100,000 will lose even more.

SMALL BUSINESS ■ Small Business Ombudsman created for businesses to find out about
government programs ■ Protection from unfair contracts will be extended to small businesses to help
create a level playing field with big business THE VERDICT Small business will benefit from a
company tax rate cut of 1.5 per cent. For Australia’s largest businesses, this will be offset by a 1.5 per
cent Parental Leave levy.
