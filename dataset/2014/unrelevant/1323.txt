A secret $7 million payment to Hong Kong chief executive C. Y. Leung by Australian engineering
company UGL was agreed on the same day a rival bidder trumped UGL's offer for his property
firm by about $184 million.

The higher bid was rejected and Sydney-based UGL bought DTZ for $177 million and is now selling
it, with other assets, to US private equity groupTPG Capital for about $1 billion.

One condition of the $7.3 million payment to Mr Leung was that he "support the acquisition of the
DTZ group by UGL", according to a letter outlining the agreement.
The letter does not mention the rival bid. But an administrators' report into DTZ after the sale
mentioned a rival "confidential" offer that valued DTZ at roughly $184 million more than UGL.
The other bidder was later revealed as China's state-owned Tianjin Innovation Financial Investment
Company.
The higher bid from Tianjin was rejected by the DTZ board, which included Mr Leung, who ran
DTZ's fast-growing Hong Kong and China business. DTZ's creditors agreed with the decision and
deemed the bid too risky because it would have taken eight weeks to complete and required
shareholder approval.

Two bankers who worked on the deal confirmed they believed the offer from Tianjin was superior.

"We felt we had a better offer," said one banker who declined to be named. "It was very frustrating at
the time."

Another banker said: "The seller [DTZ] had the ultimate right to decide who the winning bidder was."
A spokesman for UGL said the company had no firsthand knowledge of any higher offer.
"UGL negotiated and entered into the agreement with Mr Leung to protect UGL's commercial
interests in North Asia by preventing him from competing with DTZ or employing DTZ staff for two
years following UGL's acquisition of the subsidiaries of DTZ Holdings plc," UGL said in a statement.
