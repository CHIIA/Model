Property group Fragrance Group, will be trading ex-dividend on Oct 13 for an interim dividend of 0.1
cents per share for 1HFY2014 ended June. This translates into a dividend yield of 0.44%, based on its
Oct 7 closing price of 22.5 cents. In FY2013, Fragrance paid out an interim and final dividend of 0.1
cents and 0.4 cents respectively, making it a total of 0.5 cents.

In Singapore, Fragrance’s portfolio of properties includes Suites @ Bukit Timah, Urban Vista, Le Regal
and Novena Regency. In Australia, it recently acquired commercial and mixed-use developments in
Melbourne, Tasmania and Perth. Last month, Fragrance announced its proposal to spin off and list its
Australian property business on the Singapore Exchange’s Catalist board.

Fragrance said earnings in 1HFY2014 fell 21.5% to $57.3 million from $73 million a year ago, even
though revenue rose 10.4% to $257.7 million. This was because gross profit margin from the property
development sector decreased to 27.2% during the first half of the year, compared with 36.7% in the
same period a year ago, owing to the lower selling price of property development units. As at end-June,
cash and cash equivalents stood at $138.5 million.
Meanwhile, China Merchants, a toll roads operator in China, will trade ex-dividend on Oct 16 for an
interim dividend of 3.5 cents per share for 1HFY2014 ended June. This translates into a dividend yield of
3.7%, based on its Oct 7 closing price of 94 cents. In FY2013, China Merchants paid out a total of
seven cents, comprising an interim dividend of 2.75 cents and a final dividend of 4.25 cents.
China Merchants operates four toll roads in China: two in Zhejiang province, one in Guangxi Zhuang
autonomous region and one in Guizhou province. In September, it announced that it had completed the
acquisition of its fifth toll road, located in Jiangxi province. The acquisition was paid for with RMB116.78
million ($24.3 millon) in cash as well as 119.37 million new shares at 98.5 cents each. That raised the
company’s total shares issued to 876.8 million.
For 1HFY2014, China Merchants reported a 31% rise in earnings from a year ago to HK$397.3 million
($65.5 million). The company said the result was due to higher profit contribution from toll road
operations and the recognition of an exceptional gain of HK$66.3 million from the disposal of its
property development business in April. As at end-June, cash and cash equivalents stood at HK$2.3
billion.

Sin Ghee Huat will also be trading ex-dividend on Oct 16 for a one-time and final dividend of 1.5 cents
per share for FY2014 ended June. This translates into a dividend yield of 5.4%, based on its Oct 7
closing price of 28 cents. In FY2013, the company paid a total dividend of 1.8 cents.

Sin Ghee Huat distributes stainless steel products comprising bars, plates, pipes, tubes, flanges and
fittings to customers in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. In FY2014, earnings fell 15% to $3.65 million
from $4.32 million a year ago, even though revenues edged up 5% to $63 million. This was due to stiff
competition and higher distribution costs.

As at end-June, cash and cash equivalents stood at $18.7 million, a decrease from $23 million a year
ago. The company attributed it largely to an increase in inventory purchases and a delay in payment
by some customers. Shareholder equity remained relatively unchanged at $87.83 million compared with
$88.18 million.
