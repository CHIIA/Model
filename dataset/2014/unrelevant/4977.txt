Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open slightly
lower with our local futures contract down 4 points.

"My technical work suggests a new rally high is likely with late January a likely timeframe. My work also
suggests it is part of a topping process on an intermediate term basis. At this stage I am agnostic as to
whether it is the penultimate or final top. "The weakness in precious metals over the past two years is
signalling a liquidity event in the pipeline. This event is impacting the bond market at present. Equity
investors are always last to receive the memo.
"Watch the Japanese yen, it is the canary in the coal mine.

at 5294, down 18 points".
