US coking coal spot prices were broadly steady Wednesday after recent falls, with low-vol in particular
currently increasingly disconnected from lower spot pricing seen for Australian origins dominating spot
sales in China.
A US mining source gasped at the China trade prices seen in the past days below an equivalent
$110/mt FOB Australia, but said US coal prices hadn't followed through, at least not lowering by nearly
the same amount.

Pricing for a Central Appalachian low-vol was last heard around $123.50/mt FOB agreed a couple of
weeks back, and while there was renewed downward pressure, offers had not dropped in line with the
$10/mt plus fall in spot prices for Australian premium low-vol since the end of February. "We're not too
concerned over the Australian situation," the source remarked.
Spot trade into China on a CFR basis has translated into low netback numbers for Australian coals.
These Chinese spot market prices increasingly jar with prices for BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance
brands like Saraji, Peak Downs and Goonyella paid by monthly contract-reliant mills in the Atlantic.

BHP April sales at '$130/mt FOB'

BHP Billiton's April contract pricing for premium Australian low-vols was expected to have been agreed
at $130/mt FOB by regional buyers, a buy-side source said.

Coupled with an earlier expectation second-quarter benchmark pricing would see settlement broadly in
line with the April BHP offers is leading to pronounced two-tier pricing. "It's quite different for China and
the Atlantic right now," the source said.

Outside annual volume-agreed sales contracts priced monthly, US low-vol was not proving easily
shipped out. There was more reliance on domestic at-the-mine sales. Local sales in Appalachia had
seen price erosion too in recent weeks, he said.
Some interest in Europe on spot-based US coal sales had not converted into sales for one supplier. US
mid-vol blend pricing at $110-115/mt FOB US East Coast was given as a current indicative range.
Meanwhile, indicative high-vol B prices were $2 lower below a previous sales range, now firmly
expected by the miner at under $110/mt FOB USEC.
Updated price expectations for high-vol A spot were looking weaker than a recently realized export sale
above $121/mt FOB, with a midpoint now firmly below $120/mt FOB. Local sales for a high sulfur,
high-vol A below 32% VM were said achieving mid $90s/st mine.

High quality contract-reliant high-vol A with low sulfur and ash, along with top coking properties, were
this week still being discussed for Q2. Some of these may be pricing in the $120-$130s, with somewhat
higher prices already heard agreed for annual contracts starting April. China's current low met coal
import pricing seems to have shuttered sales possibilities into that market for US coals.

of late.
Platts US low-vol hard coking coal remained at $119.50/mt FOB USEC, US high-vol A was steady at
$116/mt USEC and the Platts high-vol B assessment lost 50 cents to $107/mt FOB US East Coast.
