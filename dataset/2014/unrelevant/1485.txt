Corporate activity in the healthcare sector is back on the agenda, with a sale process poised to get
under way for Sphere Healthcare.
Sphere was previously owned by Sydney-based private equity firm Fulcrum Capital Partners,
which closed its doors last year following a series of unsuccessful investments.

It is understood hedge fund Chenavari Investment Managers has taken control of Sphere using
warrants. Fulcrum founder Paul Riley remains the company's chief executive officer.

Sphere manufactures tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, liquids and creams under an Australian
Therapeutic Goods Administration licence. It is understood to be waiting on regulatory approval to
secure a contract to export milk powder to China, sources said.

It is believed Miles Advisory has been quietly sounding out local and offshore buyers about their
appetite for the asset ahead of a formal auction. The business is expected to fetch less than
$50 million.

Riley did not return calls.
