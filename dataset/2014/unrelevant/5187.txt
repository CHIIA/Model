MARKET ROARS UP LED BY MINERS, BANKS NOT FAR BEHIND ON STRONG VOLUME

The market shrugged off Budget blues after JP Morgan last night lifted its rating for the miners to
"overweight" from "underweight" - there was a takeover offer for PanAust, with hopes a higher offer may
be forthcoming, Baytex lifted its offer for Aurora Oil and there was corporate activity elsewhere.
Volume was strong at $4.7 billion. Our market closed up 49.8 points to 5498.2, a couple of points off the
day's best while the $A is at 93.45US c, down about 15 points from last evening.

Possible "bear trap"?

There is just a chance today has been a "bear trap".

*Short covering in the miners would have played a part in the rise - and tomorrow Macquarie, NAB and
Westpac go ex div and we will also have the outcome of the Budget.

*PanAust shot up 54c to $2.12 on 31.28m shares after announcing it had rejected a takeover offer.
*Aurora Oil rose 23c to $4.18 on 18.7m shares on a lifted offer frm Baytex.

*Northern Star rose 8.5c to $1.20 on 4.4m shares after announcing it would buy Jundee from Newmont to
become Australia's second largest gold miner with total all in sustaining costs of just a little over $1000.

*Korvest rose 63c to $7.10 after announcing a $1 fully franked special dividend.

*Meanwhile, Aussie eco news was not highly encouraging today - housing loans were down, house prices
were up and the ANZ consumer confidence report was down 2.5%.
*China's eco numbers this afternoon came in a touch below expectations - Industrial Production in April
fell to 8.7% from 8.8% and vs 8.9% expected and retail sales rose an annual 11.9% vs a Reuters forecast
of 12.2% while fixed asset investment grew 17.3% in the first four months from a year earlier, against a
17.7% rise expected.

*On the other hand, news on the Ukraine situation was distinctly encouraging - Handelsblatt reports this
afternoon the mediation efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has
raised hopes for a peaceful solution. Russian President Vladimir Putin has pledged his support for the
mediation initiative in a telephone conversation with the OSCE Chairman Didier Burkhalter, the
organization said on Monday. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) set off for Kiev on
Tuesday morning from Berlin.

According to the OSCE, the plan provides a "pragmatic" transition from the "logic of escalation" to a "logic
of cooperation".
"Whether the negotiations will lead to a success, however, is in the stars' Handelsblatt commented - at
least the referendum has been concluded without any violence.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was up 260 points to 14,430 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
down 8.40 points to 2044.47, Hang Seng futures was up 21 points to 22,139 ponts. Spot gold was down
4 point to 1292 points, crude was down 1c to $100.58.
