Renewed faith in the future of nickel has privateer QCG Resources putting the finishing touches on a
$A50M-$60M IPO for the $35M acquisition and restoration of the Avebury Nickel Mine in SW
Tasmania, Australia, that has been on care/maintenance for the past 5 years.

An $1.75M deposit has been put down, with the remaining $33.25M dependent on the IPO that will see
the renamed Avebury Nickel Mines list on the ASX.

Advanced discussions with cornerstone investors and financing partners are underway, as are plant
modification designs.

The IPO follows QCG’s signing a month ago of a binding agreement with MMG, the Australian-based
subsidiary of China’s state-owned global resources China Minmetals Corp, for the project that opened
in July 2008 and closed in Feb 2009 when the impacts of the global financial crisis sent nickel prices
plummeting.
M/D Chris Daws says work has begun on the detailed engineering and metallurgical design to get
Avebury back into production at a time of sustained, rising nickel prices. “Nickel prices have
experienced strong growth in recent months and are expected to continue rising in at least the
short-to-medium term.”

The deal includes Avebury’s 900,000tpa nickel process plant and infrastructure, a fully established
mine and ore blocks ready for extraction, a 290,000t nickel resource, enough for a +5yr mine life,
prospective nickel exploration leases, and land and accommodation infrastructure in Zeehan 6km
away.

The project historically produced Australia’s highest grade nickel concentrate at +23% Ni, is capable of
producing in excess of 7,000tpa nickel in concentrate and is fully permitted.
“Avebury is a great acquisition. For a mine that has been on care-and-maintenance for 5 years, it is in
excellent condition and we do not anticipate any problems getting it back in to production,” Daws says.
