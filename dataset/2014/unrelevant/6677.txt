*Markets were basically on hold awaiting the ECB's expected rate cut to zero plus other quantitative
measures tonight - in a trading day basically lacking in news.

Our banks were weaker, with media sources running with the Bloomberg story today that a lift in the
capital adequacy ratio for banks will preclude their paying higher dividends, citing AMP Capital Investors
head Shane Oliver. He said AMP had lowered its bank holdings to "neutral" since late last year.

(Our banks are also very over stretched given their forecast p/es and have been since the rush to acquire
yield began).

"Support at 5430 then at 5400, resistance at 5450 then 5465 .. I'll call it up 10"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500 last night had a 10 point range in a pretty
quiet night, however closing at a record high, not far off intra day highs. For the S&P500 the picture looks
as good as it can be on the technical charts. There are no real areas of resistance given it is testing new
highs - 1930 may offer resistance.
"Spot gold is consolidating around 1240/1245. I expect a dead cat bounce at some stage.
"Copper was a bit weaker last night, broke the $3.12/lb level of support. It needs to hold the $3.09/lb level
or could head back to $3/lb.

"It was a pretty uneventful night on the Euro last night, awaiting the ECB meeting tonight.
"US bond yields ticked slightly higher, now sitting just at the 2.6% level - the sell off in bonds continues.

Page179of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."China yesterday broke back below the 20 day moving average. The consolidation there has broken down
negatively. Support now is at 2010. The critical level of support is 2000. If we see 2000 broken, it may
head back to the lows of March of 1980.

"The Japanese market remains very strong, it has closed above 15,000 for two consecutive days. It has
quite a bullish chart.

"The XJO broke down yesterday below the 20 day moving average, it also broke the 50 day moving
average for the first time since early May.

"It is short term bearish. For the week we really need to see 5430 hold in my view otherwise we could
break down to the previous May lows. Any break of 5400 would see the market potentially test 5300 over
the coming weeks. However there is good support at 5430 and then at 5400. Resistance is now at 5450
followed by 5465.

"For the day, under performance on our market has been pretty much every day this week. I expect us to
take back some of that today. I will call us up 10 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 34.9 points to 5444.8, 2 points last evening.
