2357 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is likely to be mixed before key events today. China's
official manufacturing PMI is due at 0100 GMT and HSBC's final manufacturing PMI is due at 0145 GMT.
The main even is the RBA's interest rate decision and monetary policy statement following its meeting,
which concludes at 0430 GMT. In the meantime, defensive and high-yield sectors of the market are set
to recover from financial-year-end selling which pushed the index down 0.9% yesterday despite offshore
gains. Iron ore miners may fall after spot iron ore fell 1.1% to US$93.80. However, BHP (BHP.AU)
ADR's equivalent price rose 1.1%, suggesting iron ore miners were also depressed by
financial-year-end selling yesterday. Index last 5395.7. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

2356 GMT [Dow Jones]--Offshore accounts at five foreign brokerages place net buy orders for 2.1
million Japanese shares overnight, according to traders. The net buying may be positive for the market
at the open, although the yen value basis of the figures is unknown. Buy orders total 6.7 million shares,
with sell orders amounting to 4.6 million shares. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

2351 GMT [Dow Jones] Nikkei is likely to trade in a narrow range Tuesday, as the dollar continues to
trend weaker (now Y101.31), U.S. stocks ended mixed, and investors anxiously await the Bank of
Japan's quarterly tankan business survey result, due minutes before for TSE open. "The tankan result
should carry some weight in determining investor enthusiasm, since it is the first since Japan installed its
higher consumption tax," says Nomura Securities equity market strategist Junichi Wako. Expectations
aren't high, however. Wako puts the Nikkei's range for the session at 15050 to 15250. Nikkei 225
September futures ended Monday's Chicago trading up 25 points at 15165 vs its close earlier Monday in
Osaka at 15160. In the cash market, the Nikkei ended up 0.4% at 15162.10 Monday.

2345 GMT [Dow Jones]--Nymex crude is likely to consolidate for now after hitting a two-week low of
$104.66/bbl Monday before rebounding more than $1 to as high as $105.68/bbl, Dow Jones technical
analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is still negative-biased as the MACD and slow stochastic
indicators are bearish, while the five-day moving average below the 15-day moving average and
declining. Resistance is at $105.76 (Monday's high); a breach would be near-term positive, targeting
$106.19 (Friday's high), then $106.81 (Thursday's high), $107.50 (Wednesday's high), $107.73
(nine-month high hit June 20) and $108.99 (Sept. 19 reaction high). But a drop below $104.66 support
would reinstate the negative near-term view, targeting $104.35 (June 12 low), then $104.17 (June 11
low), $103.98 (June 10 low) and $102.62 (June 9 low). August crude is up 15 cents at $105.52/bbl on
Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2337 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australian consumer confidence slipped 0.3% in the week ended June 29,
according to ANZ-Roy Morgan. While 6% higher than a month ago, confidence is 9% lower than it was
before concern about the federal budget emerged in late April, and is therefore unlikely to allay the
Reserve Bank of Australia's uncertainty about the impact of fiscal consolidation. "The pace of recovery
and the level at which confidence eventually settles will be important factors in determining the likely
impact on household consumption growth, with anecdotes suggesting consumer spending activity in
recent months has been soft," ANZ economists say. "The bounce we have seen so far has not been
large enough to make us comfortable that the deterioration in confidence is transitory."

Management Office's announcement that it would issue between NZ$1 billion and NZ$2 billion of new
2027 bonds via syndicate on July 2, says BNZ strategist Kimberly Martin. The yield for the 2023 bond,
currently New Zealand's longest dated government bond, is up 2bps in early trading to 4.43%. The 2027
bond "was drastically needed because our longest bond was below nine years and most international
investors expect at least a 10-year benchmark bond. This is" filling a gap, Martin says. She said it
seemed a sensible time to issue the bonds with yields still relatively high and the international landscape
reasonably calm. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2333 GMT [Dow Jones]--UBS downgrades Ansell (ANN.AU) to "neutral" from "buy" after the glove and
condom maker flags a US$125 million writedown that will force it to miss profit guidance, underpinned
by 300 job cuts, a Malaysian factory closure and an exit from a U.S. military gloves business. "While the
booking of restructuring costs and lack of organic growth momentum was disappointing, we see scope
for upside over the longer term as management continues to work on its cost base," the broker says,
raising its price target to A$21.80 from A$20.80. Ansell was last at A$19.83. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2324 GMT -- With the S&P 500 closing flat and the Dow a tad lower, expect Asian markets to be
directionless on the open, says Forsyth Barr broker Adrian Vance, in New Zealand. He says, locally,
people will be looking for a bit of direction in the next few days as they head into a new quarter; "Over the
last few weeks markets have been going sideways to slightly lower and it's probably a case of markets
having a good run up and valuations being a bit stretched." He says there may be some focus on Tower
(TWR.NZ) following news it has sold its life insurance business. The NZX-50 is currently flat at 5136.35.

2324 GMT [Dow Jones]--Credit Suisse remains one of the loudest bears on Santos (STO.AU), keeping
an "underperform" recommendation despite a recent investor tour of its Gladstone LNG venture with
Total (TOT) encouraging other brokers, such as UBS, to upgrade their views on the stock. Sure, there
were some positives from the tour, but Credit Suisse says Santos may struggle to generate an attractive
return from the project, given cost overruns and difficulty finding enough coal seam gas to meet LNG
sales contracts for decades. "We still see meaningful risk of the bear case eventuating, under which our
group net present value would fall below A$12/share," it says. "At a share price where these risks are
baked in Santos is an interesting proposition. At current levels, it is not." Santos was last at A$14.26
versus Credit Suisse's A$12.70 price target. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2321 GMT The RBA meeting later presents downside risks for the AUD/USD, and Westpac will be
watching for "any dovish shift in language particularly regarding the high AUD," says Westpac currency
strategist Imre Speizer in a note. The pair is at 0.9432 vs. 0.9423 late Monday in Australia. Mr. Speizer
says the pair remains in a multiweek range of 0.9335 to 0.9445. Ahead of the RBA, both the HSBC
China manufacturing and the official manufacturing data will provide direction for the AUD.

19:21 [Dow Jones]--Analysts are gaining more faith in FedEx's ability to grow earnings per share by more
than 30% in FY15. Macquarie analysts are the latest, citing a confidence-building meeting with the air
express company's IR director. One factor? FedEx achieved 85% of its $1.6 billion express business
profit improvement by cutting costs, Macquarie says. "Having so much direct control supports heightened
confidence in attaining profit goals and a robust FY15 outlook," they say. In addition, margins are
improving and FedEx has strong pricing abilities. Plus, it's buying back shares. Macquarie targets
12-month share prices at $160. (laura.stevens@wsj.com)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones]--The USD/JPY will likely remain top heavy in Asia trade ahead of big events
such as U.S. jobs data on Thursday, says Shinji Kureda, head of FX trading group at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking. "Market sentiment now is biased toward a weaker dollar," says Mr. Kureda, who tips the pair
will likely trade in a 101.00-101.50 range. But Mr. Kureda says the pair may go up depending on the
data. The pair is at 101.30 against 101.33 in New York late Monday. The EUR/USD is tipped in a
1.3650-1.3720 range. It is at 1.3692. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)
