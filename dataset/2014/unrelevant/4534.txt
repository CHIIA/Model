Harry Triguboff's Meriton Group has bought another development site in Sydney's southern urban
renewal corridor – a $75 million Mascot site where it intends to build 400 apartments.
The acquisition was Meriton's sixth for 2014 and the group has spent more than $1.4 billion on
development sites since January 2013.

Meriton managing director Harry Triguboff said the Church Avenue site was opposite Meriton's Mascot
Central town centre, which is under construction and allowed the group to capitalise on the amenity it
was building in the suburb.
Mr Triguboff said he appreciated working with Botany Bay City Council. Under the site's existing
planning controls, 341 apartments could be built. The site was sold without development permit, but
Meriton hopes to gain permission to build about 400 apartments. "What we do is choose the councils
with which we can work. Botany is very easy to work with – and if it is easy, it might mean a saving of
one year, which of course is big money and means we can produce more [housing]," Mr Triguboff said.

Meriton land acquisitions manager Angelo Mantsis brokered the deal with CBRE agents Matthew
Ramsay, Scott Gray-Spencer and Olivia Skinner, who acted on behalf of the vendor, Anthony
Skinner's Orlani Property Group.
The site last changed hands for $8.2 million in 2002. Mr Ramsay said the sale set a new record for
the Mascot area as it represented $200,000 per unit site, taking into account that 341 would be
allowed under current controls.

"It was a very competitive campaign that yielded over 100 inquiries and resulted in 10 expressions of
interest from a number of large local private investors and several offshore investors," Mr Ramsay
said.

"Interestingly, the offshore interest came from both private and listed companies, including two listed
groups from Hong Kong."

Given its location near Meriton's future town centre and near a railway station, Mr Ramsay dubbed the
site Mascot's best. He attributed the amount of interest to the location and demand for apartments in
the area, where the average price of a two-bedroom apartment is now more than $800,000.
