ASTANA. May 19 (Interfax) - KazAgro placed 5-year Eurobonds for 600 million euro on May 15.
The final coupon rate was fixed at 3.255% per annum, the company said.

"We are definitely pleased with the Eurobond offering. On the back of a stable market environment and a
very efficiently conducted preparation, KazAgro had a unique opportunity to raise medium-term funds in
euro for diversification of its debt portfolio and at a record low cost in the history of Kazakhstan," KazAgro
CEO Dulat Aitzhanov said.

The raised funds would go to finance government-approved long-term projects within Agribusiness 2002.
HSBC Bank Plc, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Citigroup Global Markets Limited are the lead arrangers of
the issue and Kazakhstan-based Tsesna Capital the underwriter.

KazAgro last week conducted a series of meetings with international institutional investors in Europe. The
roadshow resulted in a EUR 2.7bn final order book with the participation of over 240 accounts, most of
which invested in the Kazakh agricultural sector for the first time.

"This Eurobond offering was the first euro-denominated Eurobond deal out of Kazakhstan since 2007.
This issue presented the lowest cost of borrowing among Kazakhstan issuers and one of the lowest
coupons among euro trades in the CIS," the company said.
The $2 billion bond program was approved by KazAgro board of directors on April 19, 2013.
The first issue of Eurobonds under this program was conducted in May 2013 and was worth $1 billion
with a 4.625% coupon rate. The ten-year bonds were placed on the Irish and Kazakhstan stock
exchanges.

National Managing Holding KazAgro JSC, established in December 2006, is in charge of the
government's agricultural policy. The company manages the assets of its subsidiaries: JSC National
Company Food Contract Corporation, JSC KazAgroProduct, JSC KazAgroFinance, JSC Agrarian Credit
Corporation, JSC Fund for Financial Support of Agricultural Sector, JSC KazAgroGarant and JSC
KazAgroMarketing.

MOSCOW. May 20 (Interfax) - PhosAgro boosted earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) 13% year-on-year on Q1 2014 to 8.587 billion rubles, the fertilizer producer said in a
statement.

Page222of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.This was higher than the 8.07 billion rubles that analysts predicted in a consensus forecast for Interfax.

Results
Net profit to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) fell 42% to 1.9 billion rubles, due mainly
to a weaker ruble, which caused FX losses to grow by 2.7 billion rubles.
"If net profit were adjusted for outstanding exchange rate lost, it would be over 5.7 billion rubles versus
4.3 billion rubles in the first quarter of 2013," PhosAgro said.
Revenue advanced 2% to 29.4 billion rubles. Phosphate-based fertilizer sales rose 2% to 24.687 billion
rubles. The company increased production of phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP by 4.3%
year-on-year. Production and sales volumes for phosphate rock and nepheline concentrate increased in
by 2.5% and 14.2%, respectively, the company said. Sales fell largely because of a significant increase in
cost and freight, which resulted in higher shelf stock to the end of the reporting period. This was also
brought about by more stock in PhosAgro's distribution system leading up to the beginning of spring
sowing in Russia, PhosAgro said.

Revenue from NPK fertilizer sales on the domestic market increased 60% year-on-year, which was partly
compensated by a low price level for NPK fertilizer in the first quarter. Revenue from these sales on the
domestic market increased 42% to 2.406 billion rubles. Revenue from NPK export sales declined 9% to
3.325 billion rubles, mostly because of a 10% drop in NPK export sales. Revenue from DAP/MAP sales
fell 3% to 8.831 billion rubles due to 6% fewer sales.
Gross profit for the segment was up 17% at 9.99 billion rubles.
Revenue from nitrogen fertilizer increased 25% to 4.57 billion rubles, while revenue from export sales of
urea was up 31% at 3.168 billion rubles. Ammonia nitrate sales grew 20%, and sales revenue was up
14% at 1.335 billion rubles. Gross profit from the segment increased 26% to 1.828 billion rubles.
Operating profit was 6.6 billion rubles, up 16%, while cash flows from operating activities increased 60%
to 6.5 billion rubles.

EBITDA margin grew to 29% in Q1 2014 from 26% in Q1 2013.
PhosAgro's net debt as of March 31, 2014 was 45.4 billion rubles against 43.8 billion rubles at the end of
2013. At the same time, the net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3 from 1.8.
Capital expenditures were up 28% in terms of value at 3.81 billion rubles.

Strategy
The board of directors of PhosAgro approved the framework of the company's development strategy to
2020, PhosAgro said in a statement.

PhosAgro did not disclose the investment volumes or production targets contained in the strategy, but
said the "main capital expenditure project during the next three years is construction of the high-tech
ammonia production line with a capacity of 760,000 tonnes per year at PhosAgro-Cherepovets (over 25
billion rubles including infrastructure)."

"Other investment projects involving the construction of new production lines that process ammonia will be
announced at PhosAgro's Capital Markets Day, which is currently planned for September of this year," the
statement says.

The goals of the strategy are "further modernization and increasing of production flexibility at the
Company's mineral fertilizer production lines, heightened self-sufficiency in key inputs (including
ammonia, electricity and sulphuric acid), increased depth of processing of apatite ore and greater internal
processing of phosphate rock, continued consolidation of PhosAgro's subsidiaries and widening of the
Company's product line to include new grades of fertilizers, technical phosphates and other products.
PhosAgro chief Andrei Guryev said earlier that the company had frozen implementation of a project to
build new ternary fertilizer capacity at the Balakovo facility in Saratov region and instead would carry out
the project at PhosAgro-Cherepovets.

PhosAgro includes OJSC Apatit in Murmansk region, OJSC PhosAgro-Cherepovets in Vologda region,
Balakovo Mineral Fertilizers LLC and Metache LLC in Leningrad region.

Page223of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.MOSCOW. May 15 (Interfax) Expectations that fertilizer producer PhosAgro's depositary receipts would
be added to the MSCI Russia index proved unfounded, following the latest semi-annual rebalancing of the
index overnight last Wednesday.
The index company adjusted the weightings of depositary receipts for shares in Magnit to 7.06%.

The changes will come into effect on June 2.

MSCI indexes are tracked by many investment funds that invest in the stocks included in proportion to
their weight in these indexes, and also develop complex structured products based on indexes. Inclusion
in the MSCI index guarantees a stock greater liquidity.
MOSCOW. May 19 (Interfax) - EuroChem posted a net loss of 965 million rubles in the first quarter of
2014 under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) compared with a net profit of 4.8 billion
rubles in the same period last year, the fertilizer company said in its financial statement.

The losses were driven by FX translation losses due to the ruble's sharp devaluation.
Sales revenue grew 6% year-on-year to 49.4 billion rubles ($1.4 billion).
Earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 15% to 14.2 billion rubles ($405
million).
Gross profit increased by 15% to 19.8 billion rubles.
Sales in the nitrogen and phosphate segments (not including iron ore, baddeleyite or hydrocarbons)
came to 2.74 million tonnes in Q4 2014, down slightly from 2.76 million tonnes in the same period of last
year.
Strong demand for nitrogen fertilizers helped lift sales in the nitrogen segment 3% to 2.1 million tonnes,
while sales in the phosphate segment fell 11% to 600,000 tonnes.
Iron ore and baddeleyite sales grew 9% to 1.3 million tonnes.

Stavropol production
EuroChem plans to invest 70 billion rubles to develop production capacity in Stavropol territory up to
2021, according to an agreement on socioeconomic partnership that the company signed with the
regional administration on Friday.

"We have made the decision to implement three medium-scale projects in Stavropol territory, including
boosting capacity to produce compound fertilizers needed by local agriculture, production of less volatile
granulated ammonium nitrate and production of a new fertilizer (potassium nitrate) for greenhouse
farming," EuroChem CEO Dmitry Strezhnev told journalists after the document signing.
Astrakhanskaya Oil & Gas
EuroChem also announced it has bought 20.1% of Astrakhanskaya Oil and Gas Company in February
for 1.338 billion rubles.
EuroChem expects to buy another 54.77% of the company after obtaining regulatory approval.
The company paid for the 20.1% in cash. Reports had said EuroChem did not plan to raise loans to pay
for the asset.

The deal is subject to approval by the government's foreign investment commission.
Astrakhanskaya Oil and Gas Company, formed in 2000, holds the license to the right-bank section of the
Astrakhanskoye gas condensate field, which is 655 square kilometers in area and contains an estimated
220 billion cubic meters of gas and 20 million tonnes of oil. Gazprom subsidiary Gazprom Dobycha
Astrakhan holds the license to the field's left-bank section.
According to the SPARK-Interfax database, Gazprombank owns 74.87% of Astrakhanskaya Oil and Gas
Company and the Astrakhan regional administration is also a shareholder.

KYIV. May 19 (Interfax) - On May 16 the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
SurveillanceRosselkhoznadzor lifted the restrictions on poultry, ready-made meat products, by-products
and poultry fat produced by Ukraine's Tavr Plus and pre-cooked lamb, beef, horsemeat and poultry
produced by Ukraine's Salkom Plus (both enterprises are in the Donetsk region).

Page224of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.At the same time, the import of products from the named enterprises is permitted only via Troebortnoye,
Pogar, Matveyev Kurgan, Perekop and Chongar checkpoints, Rosselkhoznadzor said in a statement.

Tavr Plus was founded in May 2008 on the basis of the Artyomovskiy meat processing plant.
Rosselkhoznadzor has repeatedly banned imports of different meat products from this enterprise due to
violations of quality and safety requirements. Restrictions on poultry imports to Russia were introduced in
October 2013.

YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK. May 16 (Interfax) - The Western and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia for the
Ukrainian situation will have no effect on the fisheries industry of the Russian Far East, including the
Sakhalin region, said Sakhalin region vice-premier Sergei Karepkin who is in charge of the fisheries
sector.

"We are not expecting any problems or negative implications for the fisheries industry of our region from
the Western and U.S. sanctions; they are not our concern so far. I do not see any difficulties," he told
Interfax on Friday.

Far Eastern fishermen export sea bio-resources mostly to Southeast Asia, first and foremost, to Japan,
South Korea and China, Karepkin continued. He noted they did not have any problems in imports of
equipment for the fisheries industry modernization either and most hardware was supplied by the same
countries.

"If the sanctions cause any problems in the long run, more sea bio-resources will be supplied to the
domestic market. This will play into the hands of our businessmen and the fisheries industry," the
vice-premier said.

MOSCOW. May 20 (Interfax) - Mexico is planning to ship seafood to Russia, Russian agricultural
watchdog (Rosselkhoznadzor) said in a press release.

This issue was discussed at a meeting between the head of Rosselkhoznadzor and the chief of Mexico's
sanitation operations service, Alvaro Perez Vega, on Tuesday. Mexico's Ambassador to Russia Ruben
Guerrero Beltran also took part in the meeting.

The Mexican officials stated that Mexico was interested in new seafood markets, among which the market
of the Customs Union played a particularly important role. Mexico exports a yearly 45,000 of this product
to EU countries, as well as to Costa Rica, China, Guatemala, El Salvador, Japan, the Philippines and
Vietnam.

Rosselkhoznadzor representatives familiarized Beltran and Vega with requirements for seafood
shipments, and gave them a list of questions to begin the export procedure for the Customs Union. After
Mexico's veterinary service issues an official response, the parties will continue working in this area, the
press release says.

MOSCOW. May 20 (Interfax) - The Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance
(Rosselkhoznadzor) and its Brazilian counterpart plan to sign a document next week that would allow the
start of mutual deliveries of fish and fish products.

"Next week, on the sidelines of a general session of the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) in Paris we
plan to sign a document with Brazil that will stipulate the conditions for safe deliveries of fish products and
effectively allow trade begin," official representative of Rosselkhoznadzor Alexei Alexeyenko told Interfax.

Recently Alexeyenko returned from Brazil, where he held negotiations with the country's head veterinary
inspector and representatives of the fisheries and aquaculture ministry.

He also said mutual deliveries were at issue. Brazil plans to supply Russia with mackerel and some other
types of fish that are caught off of its coasts. Moreover, Brazilian companies are also ready to export
aquaculture products, in particular, tilapia and shrimp. "Brazil even expressed interest in Russian cod,"
said Alexeyenko.

"That we are discussing bilateral trade is very important for us. We must avoid situations resembling the
one which developed on the salmon market, when one country, Norway, became a monopoly," he said.
Alexeyenko said that the Brazilian side expressed interest in deliveries to Russia of dairy products,
especially, dry milk and butter, as well as honey. The possibility of trade in these products will also be
discussed in Paris.

AKTAU. May 19 (Interfax) - Non-governmental Organization Eco Mangistau has asked the prosecutor's

Sea coast over this weekend. Several hundred fish died, according to eyewitnesses.

Eco Mangistau said it had sent the inquiry to the Environmental Prosecutor's Office for taking action in
connection with this information.

Russian food market.
"A 16-tonne consignment of whole dried milk was shipped from the Australian state of Victoria. Lab tests
showed the bacterial count 15 times above the limits. It points to a breach of sanitary rules and technical
regulations for product manufacturing," said a spokesperson for the Primorsky Territory office of
Rosselkhoznadzor, a Russian agriculture watchdog.
The milk was supplied for a Vladivostok-based company by Australia's Tatura Milk Industries Ltd., the
spokesperson also said.

minister also asked the Serbian administration to file a new humanitarian aid request if necessary.

LUHANSK, Ukraine. May 17 (Interfax) - The chief spokesman for one of the anti-Kyiv militias in eastern
Ukraine on Saturday denied there are any food shortages in Luhansk region.

The United Army of the Southeast "has taken control of all vital facilities in the Luhansk People's
Republic," Vasily Nikitin told a news conference.

"There are no problems with food supplies," he said. "Food supplies are under control. I also do some
shopping - all the food is there."

KHARKIV. May 15 (Interfax) – Leading candidate for the post of Ukrainian President MP Petro
Poroshenko has said that a ruling of Moscow City Court on the declaring legal the arrest of the Russia
accounts of the Roshen confectionary factory, which he owns, is evidence that his political position is
right.

"This is the confirmation of the fact that the policy I stick to is pro-Ukrainian," he said at a press
conference on May 15 in Kharkiv.

He said that Russian courts confirmed the decisions they made in July 2013 when they banned Roshen
from supplying products to Russia, and today Russian leaders continue this policy.

"I believe that this is the sign that I do everything right," he added.

He also said that the economic sanctions should not be of a political nature, as they are now.

Poroshenko said that he is doing everything to regulate the decisions in trade disputes in the World Trade
organization (WTO), although he said that unfortunately Russia disregards the WTO.

On May 14, Moscow City Court declared legal the arrest of Russia accounts of Roshen confectionary
factory worth almost 3 billion rubles. Thus, the counterclaim against the ruling of Tver court was turned
down.

In late March Tverskoi Court of Moscow as a part of a civil claim initiated by Uniconf holding against
Russian enterprises of Roshen Corporation, arrested the accounts of the company in Russia.

and to invest in the construction of a new factory. The sum arrested amounts to 2.8 billion rubles,"
Roshen said on march 21.
Roshen Corporation includes confectionery factories in Kyiv, Kremenchuk and Vinnytsia, the dairy
producer Bershadmoloko. It also runs confectionary facilities in Klaipeda (Lithuania), Lipetsk (Russia), and
Bonbonetti Choco (Hungary). In February 2014, the corporation shut down its factory in Mariupol,
explaining the closure of the factory by the pressure of tax agencies and a ban on supply of Roshen
products made in Ukraine to Russia.

The corporation manufactures up to 200 types of confectionery products, including chocolate and jelly
sweets, caramel, chocolate, biscuits, waffles, and cakes. It produces 450,000 tonnes of products a year.

In all, the Siberian Federal District has seen 4,495 forest fires on an area of 652,800 hectares since the
beginning of this wildfire season.

Meanwhile, rain in the majority of districts of the Trans-Baikal territory has helped put out nearly all forest
fires there.

"Only two fires are left in two districts of the Trans-Baikal territory, their total area is 13 hectares," the
regional forestry service told Interfax.

The Federal Forestry Agency reported eight forest fires on 12,500 hectares on Thursday.

The territorial hydro-meteorological service said the cyclone would not go away until Saturday and the
weather would be warm and shiny on Sunday.

In all, the Trans-Baikal territory has seen 747 fires on 395,300 hectares since the beginning of this wildfire
season. There were 288 fires on 47,300 hectares a year ago.

ASTANA. May 15 (Interfax-Kazakhstan) - Eighty falcons, brought from the United Arab Emirates (the
UAE), were released on Thursday into the wild in Mangistau region.

Page229of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Falcons are released into the wild every spring. Target scientific research has been conducted for this
purpose, several comfort areas for falcon habitat and breeding have been selected worldwide after
summing it up. In our country this is East-Kazakhstan and Mangistau regions, where required fodder
reserve and appropriate landscape are available: knolls and the steppe," Kazakhstan's Environmental
Protection and Water Resources Ministry said in a press release.

The falcon release into the wild was carried out as part of the UAE government program aimed at
protecting this species and creating conditions for increasing falcon populations in the wild.

The birds were kept for an adaptation course lasting several weeks in order to get used to local climate
and barren space and over which they were intensively fed and inspected on a daily basis - wireless
devices were installed on the falcons before their release to track the bird's migration, the ministry said.

Twenty peregrin falcons will be released on May 16 in Mangistau region and nineteen saker falcons from
the UAE will be released on May 17 in East Kazakhstan region, according to the ministry. Over 340
falcons were released into the wild in 2009-2013 in East Kazakhstan region in the framework of
cooperation between Kazakhstan and the UAE, the press release said.

SIMFEROPOL. May 20 (Interfax) – There were moves this week to address the situation on the Crimean
peninsula regarding water supplies, most notably the decision to direct water from the Biyuk-Karasu river
and two reservoirs in the Piedmont region to the North Crimean Canal, earlier emptied when Ukraine cut
supplies following the region's accession to Russia. Experts believe the region will not acquire a
permanent water supply of its own until at least 2018 and that such a project will cost billions of rubles to
implement. In the meantime, there have been calls for the region to move away from irrigation
water-intensive crops such as rice and soy. Russia's Federal Agency for Subsoil Use Rosnedra said
explored reserves of underground potable water in Crimea show that yield could exceed 1 million cubic
meters per day, enough to meet drinking water needs and even problems with irrigation, in principle.

North Crimean Canal

The North Crimean Canal, which emptied out following Ukraine's decision to stop Dnieper water supplies
to Crimea, is being supplied with water from the Biyuk-Karasu river and two reservoirs in the Piedmont
region of Crimea, the press office of the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology public council
said on Friday.

According to the information of Minister of Natural Resources and Ecology Sergei Donskoy, water
supplies to North Crimean Canal were resumed on May 12.

"It has become possible thanks to high speed of infrastructure construction necessary to connect the river
and canal. It was started in late April and was completed in very early May. The total cost of the work
amounted to 5.5 million rubles," Donskoy said.

Water is entering the North Crimean Canal along the Biyuk-Karasu river from the Tayganskoye and
Belgorodskoye reservoirs, which are in the river bed, the minister said.
The Tayganskoye reservoir has accumulated around 30 million cubic meters of water, which could be
used to supply the eastern regions of Crimea, which had received Dnieper water from North Crimean
Canal, Crimean First Deputy Prime minister Rustam Temirgaliyev has said.

According to the information of the public council under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology,
preparatory works are currently being held at the Feodosiyskoye reservoir, to which water from North
Crimean Canal will come, and water supplies from the canal to reservoir will begin on May 23.

At the same time, work to transfer water from the Salgir River, the largest on the peninsula, to the North
Crimean Canal is continuing.

Steady water supply
Crimea will acquire a permanent water supply system no earlier than in 2018, Environmental Design
Institute head Vladimir Slobodyan said.

"A profound study of the region's micro-geology and its subsoil water reserves will be necessary for
implementing the water supply strategy. Considering all factors, we can see that permanent water supply
can be achieved in 2018-2019," he said at a press conference dedicated to water supply in Crimea on
Tuesday.

It is possible to complete engineering and geological survey and process the obtained data before the end
of 2014, Slobodyan said.

Page230of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.It will take at least two years to draw up the Crimean water supply project and will cost several billions of
rubles, he said.

Meanwhile, experts said Crimea should cut water consumption for irrigation purposes through a farming
scheme change.

"It is necessary to stop cultivating water-intensive crops: rice, soy and corn. These crops will have to be
abandoned and traditional crops of the Crimean region should be sown instead," full member of the
Russian Geographic Society Sergei Golubchikov said.

Underground reserves

Russian deputy Natural Resources minister and head of Rosnedra Valery Pak and the Crimean prime
minister have signed an agreement on the transfer of certain authority in the use of subsoil resources to
the Crimean authorities.

A similar agreement was compiled for Sevastopol and this will be signed in the near future, Rosnedra said
on its website.
Explored reserves of underground potable water in Crimea show that yield can exceed 1 million cubic
meters per day, Rosnedra said. The peninsula has sufficient underground reserves of drinking water and
even problems with irrigation can, in principle, be resolved by collecting snow and rainwater. There are
sufficient resources of fresh underground drinking water for the population of Crimea.

Because Crimea's water supply has mainly been supplied via the North Crimean Canal from Ukrainian
territory, not all water wells have been utilized. Some of the mothballed deposits are already being put into
operation and drilling rigs have been installed at wells.

Scientists are looking at realistic projects to improve Crimean water supply in the near future. Among
these is a project to supply water from the central part of the peninsula, which has sufficient supplies, to
waterless areas, such as Kerch and Chernomorsk. A water pipe could be laid along the bed of the North
Crimean Canal. Another possibility is being considered for the Kerch section where local underground
water may be desalinated.

Rosnedra organizations - the All-Russian Research Institute of Hydrogeology and Engineering Institute
(VSEGINGEO) and Hydrospecgeology will take part in resolving water supply issues. VSEGINGEO
reckons one way to address the water supply issue is to build a geofiltration and geo-migration model of
underground water in Crimea, which would help keep track of changes and formulate forecasts for the
future.

Artesian water

Pipeline battalion units of the Western Military District logistics brigade earlier assembled a five-kilometer
pipeline and started the delivery of artesian drinking water to the town of Stary Krym.

"The pipeline supplies about 2,000 cubic meters of water daily," says a report posted by the Russian
Defense Ministry press service and information department and seen by Interfax-AVN on Wednesday.

"Extensions are being built from the pipeline to other towns and populated areas," it said. "In all, the
peninsula will have over 125 kilometers of trunk pipelines with the daily capacity exceeding 9,000 cubic
meters."

Ukraine significantly reduced the water supply to Crimea by the North Crimean Canal in early April. The
water supply came to a complete halt later on.

The irrigation and water supply North Crimean Canal was built in 1961-1971 to water drought-ridden
areas of the Kherson and Crimean regions with Dnieper River water taken from the Kakhovka water
reservoir.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu assigned the logistics units to deliver freshwater to southeastern
Crimea in early May.

TASHKENT. May 19 (Interfax) - A resolution from Uzbek President Islam Karimov on measures to further
improve the management and financial situation of agricultural engineering companies envisages the
creation of an agricultural engineering holding company (Uzagroprommashholding).

The press published the resolution on May 17.

Page231of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.This measure aims to further improve the management of agricultural engineering companies, to increase
their efficiency and profitability and to implement a unified technical policy in the industry that will be
geared toward upgrading production and ensuring the production of modern, high-performance equipment
and machinery that are competitive on the home and foreign markets.
The resolution sets out the key tasks and directions of the new holding company.

Uzagroprommashholding will perform market research of the domestic and foreign markets, coordinate
production and supplies of different products for agriculture, increase the competitiveness of the
equipment produced and expand the range and volume of exports.

There will be a unified technological and investment policy with the aim of creating new and upgrading
existing production through the use of modern energy and metal conserving technology. Cooperation
between companies within the holding and other companies will be developed and a unified service policy
in the maintenance of agricultural equipment adhered to.

The resolution envisages a focus on the production of tractors, trailers and cotton harvesters at the newly
formed OJSC Tashkent Agricultural Equipment Plant. Another newly formed company - OJSC
Chirchiksky Agricultural Equipment Plant will produce mounted and trailer equipment.

A government task force has two months to organize the establishment of Uzagroprommashholding,
including compilation of founding documents and government registration, approval of the holding
company's charter and putting together an executive team.

The Cabinet of Ministers also has a two-month terms to develop and approve a program of further
improvements in the system for service maintenance of agricultural equipment in 2014-2016.

GORKI. May 19 (Interfax) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Khloponin has received new powers
as part of the "reconfiguration of job duties" among senior government officials.

"Due to the change of Khloponin's status I have decided to hand over part of the powers to coordinate
several activities, in particular, natural resources and nature management. Now these issues will be taken
up by Aleksandr Gennadyevich (Khloponin)," Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting
with his deputies on Monday.

Khloponin will be in charge of the issues concerning "the relevant watchdogs," Medvedev said.

"In addition, I would like Aleksandr Gennadyevich to focus on complex spheres such as alcohol product
regulation - a difficult and quite criminal sphere that requires special, increased attention," Medvedev said.

Khloponin is in charge of inter-ethnic relations, he added.

Khloponin will remain in charge of coordinating the work of the Ministry for North Caucasus Development,
he said.

"The territorial set of issues associated with the development of our North Caucasus will also remain
within your powers," Medvedev told Khloponin.

ASTANA. May 19 (Interfax) - Fitch Ratings has affirmed KazAgroFinance's (KAF) Long-term Issuer
Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB-' and removed them from Rating Watch Negative (RWN).

A Stable Outlook has been assigned.

Fitch also affirmed short-term foreign currency IDR at 'F3' and removed from RWN, It also affirmed
National Long-term rating: affirmed at 'AA(kaz)' and removed from RWN, Stable Outlook.

The removal of the RWN on KAF mirrors that on its parent KazAgro National Managing Holding JSC
(KazAgro, BBB/Stable, see 'Fitch Affirms KazAgro at 'BBB'; off RWN; Outlook Stable).

Page233of250©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."KAF's IDRs, National Long-term and Support Ratings factor in the likelihood of support the bank may
receive, if needed, from Kazakh authorities (through KazAgro). This is based on the track record of capital
injections, the low cost of potential support, KAF's status as a material subsidiary of KazAgro and the
significant risks of reputational and market access damage in case of KAF's default," according to the
statement.

At the same time, the current two-notch differential between the KAF's foreign currency IDR and that of
the Kazakh sovereign reflects " less prominent policy role as a development institution and lesser
importance for the country's economy and financial system relative to other government-owned
institutions in Kazakhstan, and the company's indirect government ownership, which may in some
scenarios impact the timeliness of support," according to Fitch.

"KAF's vulnerable asset quality and growth plans also mean that its leverage may over time increase
significantly from the current low level," said Fitch.

Fitch may downgrade KAF's ratings if the agency believes that support propensity in respect to KAF has
weakened, for example, if the company's financial profile deteriorates considerably as a result of asset
quality deterioration or increased leverage without support being made available.

KazAgroFinance, founded in 1999 by Kazakhstan government, provides leasing and credit services in the
agricultural sector using public funds, borrowed from foreign financial institutions as well as its own
monetary resources. KazAgroFinance is part of JSC National Managing Holding KazAgro.

ASTANA. May 15 (Interfax) - Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) in Q1 2014 earned a net profit of
