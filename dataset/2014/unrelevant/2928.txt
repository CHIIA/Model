Pork producers in Perth County could take a financial hit from the Russian ban on Canadian agricultural
products announced Thursday, but it won't be the first time the industry has faced challenges from
abroad.

Or the last.

"We've had these situations before," said Sebringville-area farmer Doug Ahrens, a local director with
Ontario Pork. "It's Russia. It seems to be the way it goes."
Just last year, Russia and China threatened to ban the import of frozen pork products from Canadian and
U.S. processing plants over the use of ractopamine, a feed additive used to promote lean muscle.

In 2009, Russia imposed a ban on live pigs and uncooked pork from Ontario in response to the H1N1
scare.

"It's the good old world of global economy," said Ahrens Friday with a sigh.
The most recent Russian ban on agricultural imports applies to meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, and milk
and other dairy products from Canada, the U.S., the European Union, Australia and Norway, and comes
as a reaction to Western sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.

Ahrens said the year-long ban will almost certainly have some impact on producers in hog-rich
southwestern Ontario, including those in Perth County.

"We'll likely see a little bit of a price decline," he said, adding that it's too early to predict just how
significant a hit producers will take because of Russia's move.

Any negative effect will likely be tempered somewhat by the fact that pork supplies are a bit tight right now
in North America, noted Ahrens.
Still, Russia is a significant market for Canadian pork producers, worth as much as $500 million in 2012,
he added.
The U.S., Japan and China remain the top three markets, but there is "quite a swath" of countries across
the globe that buy Canadian pork, said Ahrens, and that will also help cushion the blow of Russia's ban.

A joint statement issued Thursday by Ontario Agriculture Minister Jeff Leal and International Trade
Minister Michael Chan said the province is firm in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty, and is also
standing behind the province's producers.

"While Ontario's agricultural exports to Russia are small compared to our overall agri-food exports, we
have reached out to the Ontario pork sector, which accounts for the majority of our exports to Russia, to
better understand how this will impact business," they said.

representing about 7% of the Canadian total.

"Ontario's agri-food sector, in particular our pork industry, is resilient," the ministers said. "Farmers
overcome challenges each and every day, all the while producing quality products that are exported to
countries around the world."

They pointed out that risk management programs are in place to help producers deal with any income
declines resulting from "market events."
