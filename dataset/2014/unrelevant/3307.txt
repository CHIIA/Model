CHINA and Australia have struck a major trade deal to remove tariffs from 95pc of Australian goods
in return for more investment opportunities for Chinese companies.
The deal will see China will open its borders to billions of pounds of Australian dairy, meat, seafood
and wine. In return, Chinese companies will be able to buy Australian firms worth up to A$1.08bn
(£600m) without coming under government scrutiny.

Last year, Australia exported A$52.65bn of iron ore, A$9.08bn of coal and A$8.07bn of gold to China.
But now it is trying to expand from a "mining boom" to a "dining boom".
In particular, Australian dairy farmers will get lucrative access to China's baby formula market, where
parents have shunned local brands following a toxic milk scandal in 2008.
The announcement was made during a state visit by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, after the G20
summit. Mr Xi noted that 200,000 Chinese study in Australia and China gets more than half of its
iron ore from Australian mines.
Mr Xi also gave a rare speech to the Australian parliament, in which he vowed that China would not
use force to achieve its strategic goals and promised cooperation over maritime boundaries. "China
has settled land boundary issues with 12 of its 14 neighbours through friendly consultation. And we
will continue to work in this direction."
President Barack Obama earlier warned over spats in the East and South China Seas, saying:
"Disputes over territory – remote islands and rocky shoals – threaten to spiral into confrontation."
