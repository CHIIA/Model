Australia's Alara Resources has increased its stake in its joint-venture Khnaiguiyah zinc-copper
project in Saudi Arabia with United Arabian Mining Company to 60% from 50% previously, and will
now take control of the project's development, Alara said on March 14.

Production at Khnaiguiyah — Alara's flagship project, located some 200 km west of Riyadh — is
scheduled to start in 2016 by which time zinc prices are expected to have strengthened significantly,
the company has said previously.

The mine will have a throughput of 2 million mt/year, with zinc concentrate output capacity peaking at
90,000 mt/year and copper concentrate capacity peaking at 6,250 mt/year.
Alara has said it expects production to be sold to customers in China and India.

Operating costs — including treatment and refining charges — to produce zinc at the project are
expected to be 50 cents/lb.

Alara expects preliminary construction work at the site to begin over the next few weeks, the
company said.
