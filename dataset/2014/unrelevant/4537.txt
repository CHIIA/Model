MINING PALADIN shares have rallied after the miner announced it would sell a major stake in its
flagship mine to China Uranium Corporation for $US190 million ($A217.2 million).
The company revealed yesterday it had struck a deal to sell the quarter stake in the Langer Heinrich
mine, in Namibia.

The sale will be largely used to pay down debt as the uranium price hovers around record lows.

Paladin shares jumped following the announcement yesterday, closing 0.9 per cent higher at 56.5c.
The Perth-based uranium producer had been looking for a buyer for a minority stake in the mine to
improve its balance sheet following a $40 million loss in the September quarter.
Paladin said the deal with China Uranium, which is owned by the China National Nuclear
Corporation, would allow the corporation to buy its pro-rata share of product at the prevailing market
spot price.
China National has agreed to pay a $US20 million non-refundable deposit. Completion of the deal
is subject to Chinese regulatory approvals, including approval by the National Development and
Reform Commission, which is expected to be obtained by midyear.
Paladin managing director John Borshoff said the company had conducted a wide-ranging sale
process.“The significant cash injection from this minority interest sale will largely be applied to debt
reduction, which the board considers an essential step during a time of unprecedented low uranium
prices,’’ Mr Borshoff said.
