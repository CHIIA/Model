BHP Billiton Ltd. is in talks with Jinchuan Group Co. Ltd. and Glencore Plc, with the two companies touted
as front-runners for the potential buyout of the company's Nickel West operations, The Australian
Financial Review reported Aug. 27.
Jinchuan, China's largest nickel refiner, looks to have its eye on the smelter, while commodities trader
Glencore is likely to be more interested in the refinery, the report said.

Environmental liabilities worth up to A$2 billion have been flagged as a potential hurdle in the sale of
Nickel West; however, both Jinchuan and Glencore have balance sheets that could easily support the
liability, according to the AFR.
Nickel West has reportedly been valued at around US$340 million by most analysts, but the size of the
environmental liabilities has UBS placing the asset's value at negative A$800 million.

The operation failed to make the cut to be included in BHP Billiton's planned new global metals and
mining company that will house the heavyweight's aluminum, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.
CEO Andrew Mackenzie told reporters during the company's earnings call earlier in August that Nickel
West is not a good fit for either BHP Billiton or the new company.

"We think that the best outcome for Nickel West is for that business to be owned by an operation that is
much more committed to the nickel business, and we continue with the process and talking with buyers at
the moment to see how we might actually sell that business, either in full or in part."
According to Mackenzie, Nickel West is not appropriate for the new spinout company because of the
asset's maturity and complexity.

First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Mick Davis' X2 Resources Ltd. and Trafigura Beheer BV are also said to
have shown potential interest in the Nickel West operations.
