The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close a touch lower today.

Markets closed lower in Europe and the UK last night. The US market closed mixed.

On the NYSE where 3244 issues traded there were 1,102 issues higher ,2,030 down and 112 unchanged.
On Naasdaq where 2789 issues traded there were 760 issues higher, 1,921 down and 108 unchanged.
Metals were mixed in a narrow range, crude fell, gold was sharply lower. The $A is at 93.74US c, up 1US
c since last evening.

"Support is at 5500, resistance at 5525 and then at 5535... close down 5 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "There were quite big ranges on both the S&P and Dow
last night - the S&P had an 18 point range, the Dow nearly 120 points. With volatility still there it could
cause some sort of correction in the future.
"Gold continued to fall last night. It's broken the $1300 level that previously had provided good support.
The next support is now $1280. The chart there still looks pretty bearish, but it is more than likely to see
some good support at $1280.

"The $A/$US saw a quite interesting move yesterday after the RBA Minutes. That chart is also quite
interesting - for four consecutive days it has tested and closed below the 20 day moving average. There is
not much volatility in the $A at the moment. I would not be surprised to see it head back to 93US c and
possibly break down to 92US c over the coming week. There are early signs of a short term downtrend
there.

"The German market resumed its downtrend after a bit of a relief rally. It looks a bit precarious now - I
would expect it to test the 9600 level.

"The S&P had quite a volatile night. Intra day it did test the 20 day moving average but found support
there. It also tested the 1180 level which has proven to be resistance in the past. Resistance did not break
but also support held - volatility is increasing there. We would really want to see 1967 hold for the S&P
over coming days.

"Our market started strong but then got sold into. There was a lot of profit taking around the 5530 level.

"What I have noticed is the appetite for shorting banks, especially CBA has increased. It is testing a
triangle formation that is forming on the CBA chart.

"Back to the XJO, 5535 seems to be a level for traders to take profits, but we still had a good close back
above 5500 which is a critical level for us to hold.

"If we break it we could see 5450 pretty quickly.

Page214of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."For today support is at 5500, resistance at 5525 and then at 5535.

"I will call us down 5 points. We will probably see a bit of a rally early on but it will likely get sold into".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 0.1 to 5511.3 last evening.

July 16. Good morning.

Fed Reserve chief Janet Yellen says economy still weak, some stocks overstretched

The US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in her semi-annual reprot to Congress reiterated the Fed's
intention to keep interest rates at historic lows for awhile longer. She said prices for stocks, real estate and
high grade corporate bonds remain in line with historic norms, but valuations in some markets, such as
low rated corporate debt appear stretched.

In a prepared report she singled out social media and biotech stocks as being substantially stretched.
She added while prices of real estate, equities and corporate bonds have risen appreciably and valuation
metrics have increased, they remain generally in line with historical norms," she said.

In terms of the US economy overall, Ms Yellen said that she saw "continuing slack" in the US jobs market
and warned of long-term unemployment that remained at historic highs.

She also said that gains in the housing market had been disappointing, and that despite
better-than-expected jobs growth as of late, wages remained stagnant.

*Largest lithium deal in the world signed last night

Bloomberg reports surging demand for high-performance batteries triggered the largest-ever deal for
lithium, the lightweight metal that’s a key component of the power systems in smartphones, electric cars
and cordless screwdrivers.
Albemarle Corp. (ALB) agreed yesterday to pay $6.2 billion in cash and stock for Princeton, New
Jersey-based Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC), the biggest producer of lithium and the largest deal in
lithium in the world so far.

Consumption of lithium doubled in the decade through 2012, and is growing even faster now. Albemarle
expects demand to increase as much as three times faster than the global economy, with consumers
demanding more mobile devices and electric vehicles becoming more common.

Changes in substantials reported July 14 and 15 to be posted very shortly.

development bank and emergency fund.

* Iraq's parliament has elected Salim al-Jabouri as speaker, breaking weeks of political deadlock amid a
jihadist-led Sunni rebellion in the north and west.

The main Sunni Arab bloc in the Council of Representatives had nominated the moderate Islamist for the
position.

Despite the progress, it is not clear that politicians will be able to move speedily to the next steps of
selecting a president and a prime minister.

Earlier, government forces launched an offensive to retake the city of Tikrit.

The defence ministry said troops had begun their assault at dawn against militants led by the Islamic State
in Iraq and the Levant (Isis).

The initial fighting focused around the southern Shishin district of Saddam Hussein's home city, officers
told the Reuters news agency.
