25 September 2014, 3.40 pm CEST

Nyrstar NV ("Nyrstar" or the "Company") announced today that, further to the subscription for eventually
83.43% of the total number of 170,022,544 new shares (the "Shares") offered pursuant to its rights
offering in the aggregate amount of €251,633,365.12 (the "Rights Offering" and, together with the Scrips
Offering referred to below, the "Offering"), an additional 16.57% of the new Shares are committed to be
subscribed following the completion of the offering of scrips (the "Scrips Offering"). 

Roland Junck, Chief Executive Officer of Nyrstar, said: "I am pleased to announce that, after the
completion of the offering of €350 million of 8 1/2% Senior Notes due 2019, the second step of our
comprehensive strategic refinancing has been successfully completed. This allows Nyrstar to continue
with the implementation of its stated strategy to capture the maximum value inherent in mineral resources
and concurrently to enhance the Company's financial position and financial flexibility."

The new Shares were offered with non-statutory preference rights (the "Rights") at a ratio of 1 new Share
for 1 Right (the "Ratio"), at a subscription price of €1.48 per new Share (the "Subscription Price"). The
28,166,673 Rights that were not exercised by 4.00 p.m. CET on 23 September 2014 were converted into
an equal number of scrips (the "Scrips").  The Scrips Offering took place on 25 September 2014. The
price achieved per Scrip was €0.62, which corresponds to a price per Share of €2.10. Purchasers of
Scrips have the obligation to subscribe for 1 new Share, at a subscription price of €1.48 per Share, for
every Scrip they purchase. As a result, 100% of the Offering has been committed to be subscribed for,
and the Underwriters (as defined below) will not take up any new Shares. Goldman Sachs International is
acting as Sole Global Coordinator. Goldman Sachs International and KBC Securities NV are acting as
Joint Bookrunners and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and RBC Europe Limited
(together with the Joint Bookrunners) are acting as Underwriters of the Offering.

The payment of the subscriptions with Rights and Scrips is expected to take place on or around 30
September 2014. Delivery of the new Shares will take place on or around 30 September 2014. The net
proceeds of the sale of the Scrips to which holders of unexercised Rights are entitled amount to €0.62
per coupon no. 7. The payment of this amount is expected to occur as of 30 September 2014.

A prospectus has been approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority on 10
September 2014 (the "Prospectus") and is available in English, Dutch and French. Subject to certain
