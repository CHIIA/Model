The pair revealed on Tuesday they had entered a merger implementation deed which will see Horizon
shareholders receive 0.724 Roc shares for each Horizon share they hold.This will result in Roc
shareholders holding about 42% of the newly merged company and Horizon shareholders owning about
58%.In a joint press release, Roc and Horizon said the proposed merger was backed by the boards of
both companies, subject to an independent expert verifying the merger is in the best interest of Horizon
shareholders.The proposed merger is also conditional on the completion of Horizon’s farm-out of a 40%
stake in its upstream Papua New Guinea assets to Japan’s Osaka Gas.The deal covers lock PRL 4
which contains the Stanley field, Block PRL 21 hosting the Elevala and Ketu fields, and exploration block
PPL 259 plus options to PPLs 372, 373 and 430.The deal cleared its final hurdle earlier this month when
Horizon was given the go-ahead to progress its Stanley gas condensate development in PNG’s Western
Province.Tuesday’s announcement confirmed market speculation last week that the two companies were
looking to merge after they both halted trading in their shares.If the merger goes ahead, the newly formed
entity will hold proven plus probable reserves of 36.9 million barrels of oil equivalent and best estimate
contingent resources of 120.7 million boe across assets in China, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand."The merger allows all shareholders to retain exposure to the
attractive assets of each company, whilst providing greater diversification, scale and a stronger platform
from which to continue to deliver future shareholder returns,” Horizon chairman Fraser Ainsworth
said.“After undertaking detailed due diligence on the assets and prospects of each company, the merger
terms reflect our boards' mutual judgment that the relative market valuations are the appropriate basis to
ensure both groups of shareholders have the appropriate level of equity ownership in the merged
group.”The board of the merged company will comprise of three current non-executive directors from Roc
and four non-executive directors from Horizon.Current Horizon chief executive Brent Emmett will serve as
the chief executive and managing director of the new company, while Roc chief executive Alan Linn will
continue with the merged group as the president of Roc Oil Malaysia until April next year.Ainsworth will
be appointed as non-executive director of the merged group, while Roc chairman Mike Harding will
become chairman.Horizon plans to hold a shareholding meeting in July this year and the merger
implementation is expected to take place in August.Roc appointed JB North & Company as financial
adviser and Herbert Smith Freehills as legal adviser tothe transaction, while Horizon appointed UBS as
financial adviser and King & Wood Mallesons as legal adviser.
