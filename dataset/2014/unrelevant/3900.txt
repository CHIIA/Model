Current Environment

Sector Overview

The Asia-Pacific mobile market remained the fastest growing globally over the last six months, with the
number of connections more than double those of any other region. The Asia Pacific accounted for half
the number of mobile subscribers globally and remained one of the world's fastest growing mobile
markets, according to the GSMA. According to its ?Mobile Economy Asia Pacific 2014?, the majority of
Asia-Pacific mobile subscribers were concentrated in four major markets: China, India, Japan and
Indonesia. The region incorporates a diverse range of markets, from highly advanced 4G digital pioneers,
such as Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, to developing markets, such as India, where
operators focused on building-out networks to rural areas and offering affordable mobile broadband
services.
Google (NASDAQ : GOOG) announced its intention in August to boost internet speed with China Mobile
(HKSE: 0941), China Telecom (HKSE: 0728) and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel ) (SES :
Z74) with an investment of US$300 million in an underwater cable system, Faster, with a capacity of 60
terabits per second. Faster, with a ten-million-times faster connection speed than a cable modem, will
boost internet speed, a significant tool for the faster growth of Google in connecting several billion citizens
in Asia and other parts of the world. Google said it hopes to begin installing the cable system late in 2014,
and start operations in the second quarter of 2016.

children, the KizON, designed for preschool and primary school pupils, which allows parents to keep track
of their children's whereabouts. One Step Direct Call enables parents to communicate with their children
easily, and provides information on their location throughout the day. The device, which utilizes GPS and
Wi-Fi, providing real-time location information, made its public debut in South Korea on July 10, and will be
introduced in North America and Europe before December 2014.

South Korea's Ministry of Education , Science and Technology (MEST) announced plans in January to
invest KRW1.6 trillion (US$1.6 billion) to develop 5G technology that will be 1,000 times faster than
current 4G LTE. MEST will prioritize developing new, key features for 5G, and upgrading social networking
services, estimating that projected sales for related industries using the 5G infrastructure could reach up to
KRW331 trillion (US$0.33 trillion) between 2020 and 2026. The ministry wants to implement the plan in
cooperation with operators such as SK Telecom Co (KSE: 017670), Samsung Electronics (KSE: 005930)
and LG, which own a huge portion of the worldwide smartphone market.

India's Reliance Communications Ltd (BSE: RCOM) meanwhile pushed ahead with plans to invest in LTE
broadcast technology to boost its video offerings. It is currently deploying 4G LTE services on both
TD-LTE and FD-LTE technology, and said its 4G services would be available in 2015.

Sector Performance
In 2013, the mobile industry contributed US$864 billion to The Asia-Pacific's gross domestic product
(GDP), directly supported 3.7 million jobs and contributed US$82 billion to public funding. In the first half
of 2014, most Asia-Pacific telecoms sectors enjoyed moderate growth and, thanks to investment by local
operators, smartphone penetration continued to grow. There was a rise in the average share price of most
major players between January and June 2014.

the region's GDP and supporting more than 6.1 million jobs. The growth will be supported by US$730
billion capital investment in new infrastructure by regional mobile operators.

Leading Companies

NTT DoCoMo Inc

On March 31, NTT DoCoMo (TSE: 9437) launched an outbound LTE roaming service for users travelling
in eight countries and regions, including the mainland USA and Hawaii, Hong Kong and France, allowing
its customers to roam on ultra-high-speed LTE mobile networks overseas with existing flat-rate data
roaming plans. NTT plans to continue to expand its global LTE roaming coverage, teaming up with
additional overseas partners.
In April, the company introduced new billing plan ?Kake-hodai & Pake-aeru? and, on June 1, two new
discount services for users of its 3G FOMATM and LTE XiTM mobile networks. The new billing plan
enables all Kake-hodai subscribers to make nationwide voice calls for a flat monthly rate and allows
customers to set and share monthly data quotas with family members and corporate users based on the

Page24of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.type of mobile devices they are using. In addition, its new Zutto discount provides savings on a graduated
basis for subscribers of at least six years standing, while its U25 Ouen plan offers discounts for
budget-minded customers aged 25 or younger.
China Mobile
China Mobile, the world's largest mobile operator by number of subscribers, sold 120 million TD
handsets (including TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE) through all distribution channels in the first half of 2014. The
increase in sales was due to the accelerated migration of customers from 2G to 3G and 4G networks. By
the end of 2014, the company will accelerate network construction to achieve continuous coverage in
almost all major and county-level cities, and effective network coverage in key villages and towns. In
January, China Mobile announced seven new data packages for 4G services ahead of the official launch
of Apple Inc 's (NASDAQ : AAPL) iPhone. Effective February 1, the cheapest monthly package is RMB40
(US$6.43) for 400 megabytes, and the most expensive costs RMB280 (US$45.02) for a 10-gigabyte
package. On January 17, China Mobile and Apple launched iPhones using its 4G TD-LTE technology.

Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel )
To cater to the growing needs from enterprises in the Greater China region, SingTel expanded its data
hosting capabilities in Hong Kong with the launch of Tier III data center at the Hong Kong Science and
Technology Park in Sai Kung. The data center is connected to SingTel 's large fiber and cable network,
which totals 14 data centers, allowing customers to enjoy a consistent level of service quality throughout
the entire network. The Tseung Kwan O Data Centre offers Greater China enterprises a secure,
world-class co-location data hosting services.

Since July 27, 2014, SingTel 's Indonesian customers in Singapore can use their mobile phones to
transfer money to the bank accounts of family and friends in their homeland through its mRemit service.
Funds can be remitted to more than 80 Indonesian banks, including Bank Danamon, Bank Negara
Indonesia and Bank Mandiri , and recipients can access the funds within three minutes of a successful
transaction.

LG Electronics

LG, a leader in consumer electronics and mobile communications, plans to continue its global rollout of G3
and to introduce more mass tier products in second half 2014, including variations of the LG G3, such as
the recently announced G3 Beat, and additional L Series models. At the end of June, LG and Samsung
launched smartphones supporting wireless charging technology, with charging modules produced by
affiliates Samsung Electro-Mechanics and LG Innotek .

In December 2013, LG launched its first Google Play Edition tablet, the LG G Pad 8.3, which uses the
latest Android operating system, Android 4.4 KitKat. The new device combines KitKat's full-screen
immersive mode and LG's 1920 x 1200 WUXGA Full HD IPS display. LG argues its already close working
relationship with Google would be strengthened by their collaboration on Google 's first Android Open
Source Project (AOSP) tablet.

Mergers and Acquisitions

Most Asia-Pacific telecoms sectors continued to be strong in the first half of 2014, with companies seeking
new growth areas to counter more intense competition, with the larger and more powerful telcos better
positioned to acquire other companies. For example Bharti Airtel (BSE: 532454), India's largest mobile
operator by subscriber base, announced plans in February to acquire Khaitan family-owned Loop Mobile
Ltd for Rs7 billion (US$0.12 billion). In June, Bharti signed a definitive agreement with Loop Mobile to
acquire the latter's operations in Mumbai. Through the deal, Bharti will get Loop's three million
subscribers, about 400 telecom towers and optic fibre and electronic equipment on which Loop's network
currently runs, enabling Bharti to surpass Mumbai market leader Vodafone India Ltd in customer numbers.
The transaction adds Loop's 2G-enabled network, supported by more than 2,500 cell sites, to Bharti's 2G
and 3G networks supported by more than 4,000 cell sites in the Mumbai circle. In December 2013,
Japan's Softbank Mobile Corp (TSE: 9434) paid US$1.26 billion for privately owned US mobile device
distributor Brightstar Corp . The deal strengthens SoftBank's purchasing scale for mobile devices and
further increases its competitiveness in Japan and the US. Acquisitions such as these show how
Asia-Pacific companies are developing next generation mobile services and are constantly looking for
technologies to give them an edge in providing more engaging and advanced smartphone apps.

Industry Profile

Industry Size and Value

Page25of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.CDMA, or code division for mobile communications, is a widely used mobile standard throughout the
Asia-Pacific, with the CDMA Development Group estimating the region continues to lead the world in
numbers of subscribers, revenue and service creation. High-growth markets such as China and India
raised the global number of subscribers to more than 600 million. By the end of January 2013, the world's
largest CDMA operator China Telecom 's CDMA users made up 22% of the global total. India remained
the second largest CDMA market, with more than 208.68 million subscribers at the end of February 2013.

er spending on information technology to RMB3.2 trillion (US$0.51 trillion) by 2015 at a rate of 20% each
year.

The broadband market in Australia continued to expand throughout first half 2013, with the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reporting that in June 2013, there were 12,408,000 internet subscribers in
Australia, up 30% from 9,569,000 in June 2010. They use the internet mostly for downloading TV shows,
online gaming, working from home, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The number of subscribers
with advertised internet access speeds of 24Mbps or greater grew by 9% to 1,785,000 in the three months
ended June 30, from 1,645,000 in December 2012.
As of July 2013, there were 464 million mobile internet users in China, while South Korea had 23 million
4G subscribers in second quarter 2013. Australia's 4G penetration rate was 6.76% as of June 2013, while
Singapore's was 22.9%. The Asia-Pacific had 895 million active mobile broadband subscriptions in 2013,
a 43% increase from 625 million in 2012. China Mobile estimates around 42% of its capital expenditure
budget in 2013 was allocated to its mobile network, of which 52%, RMB41.5 billion (US$6.67 billion),
was channelled to TD-LTE technology.

Sector Investment
The Chinese Government plans to spend RMB2 trillion (US$0.32 trillion) to enhance its broadband
infrastructure by 2020 to put almost the entire population online. It aims to boost fixed-line and wireless
connectivity throughout China, and the investment could benefit global network equipment makers such
as Ericsson (NASDAQ : ERIC) and Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE : ALU), as well as homegrown players such as
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd (SHE: 002502) and ZTE Corp (HKSE: 0763).

The Ministry of Information and Industry wants the 3G and 4G networks covering cities and villages to be
deployed at the same time. By 2015, the Government aims to boost the average broadband speed in
cities to 20 Mbps, and to 4 Mbps in rural China, where internet penetration is very low. The plan is
expected to increase the number of 3G and LTE users to 1.2 billion by 2020, four times the current figure.
On July 23, 2014, KDDI Corp (TSE: 9433) announced that it would spend Y24 billion (US$0.24 billion) to
construct Telehouse London Docklands North Two (North Two), a large-scale data center with a total floor
area of 23,000 square meters located in the Docklands area of London, UK. The center will increase the
total floor space of all facilities, including the four existing data centers (North, East, West, and Metro), to
73,000 square meters. It will bring the number of sites to 43 in 24 cities in 13 regions around the world,
with a total floor space of 365,000 square meters.

CIB (EPA : ACA), while Softbank Mobile and Softbank Corp (TSE: 9984) will act as guarantors.

Research and Development
In August 2014, South Korea's LG Uplus (KSE: 032640) and China's Huawei established a research
facility to test technology with potential applications in 5G networks. The Seoul-based Mobile Innovation
Centre (MIC) will also enable LG Uplus to try out Huawei's latest LTE-Advanced carrier aggregation kit,
small cells and network quality solutions. The MIC will provide LG Uplus and Huawei with an increased
competitive advantage in the ICT market, and Huawei is committed to industry cooperation and to bring
the world's most advanced mobile broadband services to more people worldwide. The 5G research center
will allow the companies to focus on small cells, FDD/TDD convergence, gigabyte data transmission and
ultra-wideband, low-latency technology that has the potential to enable remote driving.

In November 2013, Japan's mobile carrier NTT DoCoMo began to install its latest indoor multi-band base
stations and antennae compatible with the 1.5 and 1.7 GHz frequency bands for extra-high-speed LTE
network service. The network, with a maximum downlink of 150 Mbps, is currently available in parts of
Tokyo, Kanagawa, Aichi, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures. The new base station and antenna are
compatible with 3G/W-CDMA, 4G/LTE and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) carrier aggregation technologies, and
are the same size as the current single band antennae, which can fit into limited indoor spaces. By March
2016, NTT DoCoMo plans to launch its LTE-A service, which can support maximum downlink speeds of
225 Mbps.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

Page26of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.South Korea's telco watchdog the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) found that the country's
mobile operators have broken subsidy rules again. An investigation between May 26 and June 13 found
that the average subsidy offered by SK Telecom , KT Corp and LG Uplus totalled KRW616,000, (US$616)
far exceeding the legal limit of KRW270,000 (US$270).
The KCC imposed fines totalling KRW58.41 billion (US$0.06 billion), of which market leader SK Telecom
will pay KRW37.1 billion (US$0.04 billion), KT Corp KRW10.71 billion (US$0.01 billion), and smallest
player LG Uplus KRW10.55 billion (US$0.01 billion). SK Telecom and LG Uplus served one-week sales
bans after a separate KCC investigation found that they had violated subsidy rules in January and
February 2014. LG Uplus was not allowed to sign up new customers from August 27 to September 2,
while SK Telecom was banned from September 11 to September 17.

To avoid the operators breaking the same rules again, the Government, in May, passed the Device
Distribution Act, which aims to make operators' sales techniques more transparent, to curb illegal
subsidies once and for all, and to impose tougher sanctions if rules are breached. Under the new laws,
which come into effect in October, the KCC will set a benchmark device subsidy based on the factory cost
of a handset, and operators will be restricted to offering subsidies within 15% of that level. The
Government found that sales bans and fines are not sufficient to prevent illegal subsidies as operators
have been caught breaking the same rules several times.

mobile web consumption is likely to continue to grow, driven by rising smartphone penetration.

Market Trends & Outlook

The Rising Mobile Addiction

As the number of people using smartphones increases rapidly so does mobile addiction, with Flurry, a
mobile analytics firm, defining a mobile addict as a user who launches a mobile app or opens a mobile
process more than 60 times a day. Smartphone owners across five markets - the US, Brazil, China, South
Africa and Indonesia - are now more likely to be using social messaging applications such as Wechat,
KakaoTalk and Line on a daily basis rather than making voice calls, sending texts and emailing.
New York-based media monitoring firm Nielson Media Research Inc estimates Singapore and Hong
Kong had two of the world's highest smartphone penetration rates. Global information services company

Page27of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Experian (ISE: EXPN) estimates Singaporeans spend an average 38 minutes a session on Facebook ,
almost twice as long as Americans. Some hospitals sch as the Singapore General Hospital have found
that more people are reporting ?text neck? or ?iNeck? pain, due to constantly lowering their heads to look
at their smartphones.
By 2017 China will likely account for almost half of all Asia-Pacific smartphone shipments and nearly a
quarter of global shipments and, in February 2014, had an estimated 300 internet centers to tackle rising
smartphone addiction. However, growing mobile addiction is good news for mobile developers, as the
more people use smartphones, the higher the demand for content, applications, and functionality on
mobile devices.

How Much Faster is 5G?

Fifth-generation (5G) service demand in the Asia-Pacific is growing as smartphone users seek higher
internet speeds. A 5G service can download an 800 MB file in one second, compared with 40 seconds
using 4G technology. According to the Telecommunications Standards Development Society of India,
Indians do not need high internet speed to control their air conditioners, fridges or microwaves, but they
need it to watch a live cricket match without latency. With streaming speeds 40 times faster than the
current best technology, they could watch live cricket matches on 5G mobile phones wherever they are.

While India's 5G networks are scheduled to start in 2021, South Korea, the world's most enthusiastic
adaptor of mobile technology, plans to roll out its 5G network in 2017, with full availability by 2020,
following US$1.5 billion in investment. The US, Japan, and the EU are also testing 5G technology, but
South Korea's investment and commitment dwarfs their efforts. South Korea's Ministry of Engineering,
Science and Technology forecasts private companies to spend more than US$300 billion on 5G
infrastructure and technology over the coming decade to take 5G worldwide. The Government hopes to
implement the plan with investment and cooperation from operators such as SK Telecom and Korea
Telecom as well as handset makers such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics .

Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo plans to work with mobile vendors Alcatel-Lucent , Ericsson, Fujitsu Ltd
(TSE6702), NEC Corp (TSE: 6701), Nokia (HEX: NOK), and Samsung on its test run of 5G technologies
across a range of frequencies. NTT announced plans in 2013 to deploy 5G commercially by 2020 with
speeds up to 10Gbps, compared with today's LTE networks which peak at 100Mbps to 150Mbps. The
company will begin indoor trials before December 2014 at its R&D center in Yokosuka in Kanagawa
prefecture, ahead of outdoor field trials scheduled for 2015, sharing its research with other industry players
to help with 5G standardization from 2016.

Samsung will test its technology with NTT in the 28GHz band, while Ericsson will join NTT's outdoor
experiments in the 15GHz band, exploring new antenna technologies supporting Massive Multiple Input
and Multiple Output (MIMO) using the additional antennas to improve throughput. NEC and Fujitsu will join
the trial at the lower end of the higher frequency bands, between 3GHz to 6GHz, with NEC focusing on
?time-domain beam forming? with a large number of antennas for small cells in the 5GHz band. Fujitsu
will work on technology to increase capacity per area using small cells deployed in high density with
remote radio connection. Alcatel-Lucent will use existing frequency bands below 3GHz to support mobile
broadband and M2M applications.
China's Huawei announced plans in November 2013 to invest US$600 million in 5G research over the
next five years, ahead of the expected launch of 5G networks in 2020. The funds will be used for research
into a range of key enabling technologies, including air-interface technology. Huawei said it needs to
resolve several issues before 5G is implemented, such as the availability of spectrum and technological
challenges.

Smartphones to Drive Mobile Gaming Market
has become the world's biggest market, generating almost US$6 billion in revenue per year and 48% of
global revenue. The rising uptake of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has driven mobile
app revenue, which is set to almost double between 2013 and 2015, from US$13.2 billion to US$22
billion. According to Games Industry Media, Western Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific will
remain the most attractive markets for mobile game publishers.
Interactive entertainment companyKing Digital Entertainment (ISE: KING), which created popular games
such as Candy Crush Saga and Pet Rescue Saga, is the largest game developer on Facebook , and
develops games for the web, mobile (iOS and Android). It launched Candy Crush Saga on its own website
in March 2011 and on Facebook in April 2012. Following its success on Facebook , King launched Candy
Crush Saga on mobile in November 2012 and, in January 2013; it became the number one game on
Facebook . In December 2013, King entered the Japanese market with a series of television commercials,

Page28of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.and by December 4, it had become the 23rd most downloaded game in Japan on Android devices and
most downloaded from the App Store.
One in seven Hong Kong citizens plays the game daily, with the number of Hong KongCandy Crush
Saga fans up by 0.3% to 457,000 in September 2014, from 455,500 in July 2014. As of September 2014,
King had eight games available for download on the App Store including Candy Crush, Pet Rescue, Papa
Pear, Farm Heroes, Bubble Witch, Bubble Witch 2, Pyramid Solitaire and Diamond Digger. The company
has 665 employees and in 2013 it spent US$110.5 million on R&D.

Another top downloaded mobile game is Plants vs. Zombies, released by private developer PopCap
Games and publisher Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ : EA) through Facebook in May 2013. Electronic Art
provides games for mobile devices and internet-only games, as well as related functions in North America,
Europe, Asia and Australia. The game was first released on May 5, 2009, and the version for iOS was
released in February 2010, while the Android version was released on May 31, 2011, on the Amazon App
Store.

Wi-Fi Demand Grows

With the continuous rise in smartphone adoption, the demand for Wi-Fi is also growing as checking in or
logging on to various social media has become the daily routine for smartphone users no matter where
they are. Wi-Fi is generally defined as a local area wireless technology that allows electronic devices to
exchange data or connect to the internet using 2.4 GHz UHF and 5 GHz SHF radio waves.
The leading web portal in China, Sina.com, estimates 77.7% of outbound tourists in China say that they
must have access to the internet, while about 64% of them want free Wi-Fi at hotels, airports and
restaurants because they think the fees of their communication carriers are too high. Now, they can also
surf the web through their mobile devices while on buses as Lijiang Gaokuai Passenger Coach Station in
China has installed a free Wi-Fi system on nearly 50 buses to provide internet access for passengers.
Users say that the service has enabled them to stay connected with their friends and family through social
media such as Facebook and WeChat .

EAP-SIM, which started in April 2014. This is part of ongoing efforts by the Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA) to improve the user experience of Wireless@SG, a free public Wi-Fi service
that offers internet access speeds of up to 2Mbps.

The new SIM-card-based login feature offers users an always-on experience by allowing them to connect
automatically to any Wireless@SG hotspot using a supported device with a local SIM card. Singapore's
Minister for Communications and Information claims the pervasive cellular network and presence of Wi-Fi
hotspots have paved the way for service providers to roll out location-based and context-driven services to
consumers and businesses.

Market Outlook

In the second half of 2014, the number of internet subscribers is likely to continue to increase as the
internet has become an integral part of people's daily lives. The demand for spectrum is likely to increase
as more LTE services are rolled out. According to the Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) Council, the Asia-should
have 100 million FTTH homes by December 2014. Mobile app and mobile web consumption is likely to
continue to pick up, driven by rising smartphone penetration. The mobile trend is expected to continue for
the next three years.

Sector Overview
Telstra Corp Ltd (ASX : TLS), Australia's largest telecommunications provider, has signed a A$150 million
(US$150 million) deal with NBN Co Ltd , a government business enterprise, to connect 206,000 homes
and businesses with the government's preferred fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) technology. The agreement,
announced in June 2014, will involve around 1,000 nodes across Queensland and New South Wales. The
construction program is scheduled to run for 12 months, the cost to be covered by federal government
funding to NBN.

Following an investigation into telemarketing calls to numbers on the Do Not Call Register, the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) issued a formal warning to Telco Service Holdings Pty Ltd.
ACMA found that the company engaged call centers to make telemarketing calls promoting its
telecommunications products and services. From August to October 2013, 25 calls were made to numbers

Page29of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.listed on the Register. Under the Do Not Call legislation, businesses are responsible for telemarketing
calls made by outsourced call centers and must oversee the activities of contracted third parties.

On June 16, Telstra 's strong rival Optus announced a partnership with the Victorian Government and
VicTrack to allow Melbourne commuters to call, text, update social networks and browse the internet in the
city's rail tunnels. VicTrack is a Victorian Government enterprise, which owns all railway and tram lines,
associated rail lands and other related rail-related infrastructure in the state of Victoria. The move is an
important first step in delivering mobile coverage to millions of rail commuters in Melbourne, allowing
them to stay connected even underground. The agreement is part of the A$152 million (US$161.48
million) government program to upgrade the state's digital train radio system, but financial details of the
agreement were not disclosed.

Industry Size and Value

The mobile telecommunications industry continues to be an important contributor to Australia's economic
growth, with most people preferring to use mobile phones. The Australian Communications Consumer
Action Network (ACCAN) claims this is partly due to falling cost of mobile phones in the past six years.
ABS data shows the volume of data downloaded via mobile handsets in fourth quarter 2013 was 27,627
terabytes, a 41% increase from 19,636 terabytes in the second quarter. There was a 3% rise in mobile
handset subscriptions from 19.6 million to 20.3 million.

The internet is a necessity for many Australians, who use it to complete everyday tasks and access
information and services that facilitate daily social and economic interactions. In June 2013, there were
12,408,000 Australian internet subscribers, up by 30% from 9,569,000 in June 2010. They use the internet
mostly for downloading TV shows, online gaming, working from home, and VoIP. However, despite the
strong shift toward mobile and the internet, fixed-line phone services have maintained their presence in
the Australian communications environment.

Leading Companies

Telstra Corp Ltd
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, Telstra 's net profit totaled A$4.3 billion (US$4.57 billion), up by
10% from A$3.9 billion (US$4.14 billion) the previous year. Sales revenue rose by 3%, from A$24.3
billion (US$25.82 billion) to A$25.1 billion (US$26.67 billion), thanks to its growing number of mobile
subscribers. Telstra aims to create one of the world's largest Wi-Fi networks by offering Australians access
to two million Wi-Fi hotspots across the nation within five years of launch in early 2015. The plan will
usher in a new Wi-Fi era, which will help meet current data needs and deliver future capacity for the
expected explosion of Wi-Fi traffic.
Telstra announced in July that starting January 2015 it would conduct commercial trials using 20MHz of
the 700MHz spectrum band at six locations around Australia. Telstra also plans to roll out more 4G
700MHz services in a range of cities and regional centres, saying that the spectrum's lower frequency will
give customers better 4G coverage in buildings, lifts and car parks. The addition of new 700MHz spectrum
is a major investment in the future of Australian telecommunications.

Optus
In third quarter 2013, Optus' operating revenue totalled A$2.46 billion (US$2.61 billion), down by 6%
from A$2.62 billion (US$2.78 billion) in the second quarter, but net profit rose by 31% from A$167
million (US$177.42 million) to A$218 million (US$231.60 million), thanks to cost saving initiatives that
reduced operating expenses by A$202 million (US$214.60 million).

In July 2014, Optus launched its superfast 4G service in Darwin, following the previous grant of a licence
for 4G 700MHz spectrum by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), enabling faster
web browsing, downloading and video streaming in the Darwin area. Optus has also enhanced its mobile
coverage in Horsham, Victoria, with a new dedicated tower to expand mobile coverage to the south of
town. Optus argues the new tower has improved reception along major roads such as Henty and Western
Highways, giving local customers a better mobile service.

Policy and Regulatory Environment
In June 2014, the ACMA formally warned Dodo Services Pty Ltd (Dodo) (a private company) over its
compliance with the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code (TCP Code). ACMA discovered
that Dodo failed to send alerts to 5,300 fixed broadband customers about their data use, as required under
the TCP Code, during October and November 2013. The code stipulates that all telco providers must send
use alerts to customers on post-paid broadband internet plans when they have reached 50%, 85%, and
100% of their monthly data allowance.

Page30of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.According to the ACMA, Dodo cooperated with the investigation and has since rectified the issue,
compensating affected customers and capping the excess use charges. The TCP code came into effect in
September 2012, and, as of June 2014, the ACMA had issued 110 formal warnings, ten directions to
comply and one infringement notice.

Market Outlook
By the end of 2015, NBN Co 's fiber penetration will match that of DSL with about three million active
connections to homes and businesses as it continues its rollout across Australia. The telecommunications
industry will continue to grow as Optus expands its 4G network to 200 holiday destinations and regional
locations, starting in January 2015. This will bring 4G coverage to new regional locations as well as
improve indoor 4G reception in metro areas. Thanks to the availability of compatible mobile devices and
Telstra 's new consumer data share packages, the adoption of data services is likely to accelerate.
China and Hong Kong

Sector Overview
China's MIIT awarded China Telecom and China UnicomHong Kong high-speed 4G mobile network test
licences for the Frequency Division Duplex-Long Term Evolution (FDD-LTE) standard in 16 cities. This will
allow the two telcos to compete better with China Mobile, which has been deploying base stations across
the country using the TD-LTE with 4G licenses issued December 2013.
In July, the three players agreed to establish China's first joint network infrastructure company, China
Communications Facilities Services Corp Ltd with registered capital of RMB10 billion (US$1.61 billion),
with China Mobile having a 40% share, China Unicom 29.9% and China Telecom 30.1%. The joint
venture will build telecom towers, base stations and other transmission assets, while building these jointly
could help protect the environment, conserve resources and reduce network construction costs.

with an investment of RMB15 billion (US$2.41 billion). It also plans to strengthen its information
infrastructure in important regions such as the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone (SFTZ) and complete the
coverage of network lines in the 7,000 main business buildings and new-built residential districts.
By December 2014, China Mobile plans to achieve complete coverage in almost all major and
county-level cities as well as effective coverage in key villages and towns in Mainland China. It has built
410,000 4G base stations, providing coverage to more than 300 cities. It also plans to trial voice over LTE
(VoLTE) before year-end as part of its plan to consolidate its first mover advantage in 4G services.
China Unicom Ltd
During the first half of 2014, China Unicom 's revenue rose by 4% to RMB149.57 billion (US$24.05
billion), from RMB144.31 billion (US$23.21 billion) a year earlier, with its profit up 26%, from RMB5.32
billion (US$0.86 billion) to RMB6.69 billion (US$1.08 billion), thanks to the net addition of more 40

Page32of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.million 3G and 4G subscribers in the year to June 30. In April, the company launched 4G services, being
the last among its rivals to enter the expanding Chinese 4G market.
Its mobile subscriber base totalled 295.89 million as of July 30, up by 4% from 284.11 million on January
30. The number of fixed-line local access subscribers declined by 3%, from 88,023,000 to 85,440,000,
while 3G and 4G subscriber numbers rose by 13%, from 126,469,000 to 143,318,000.
China Telecom
The operating revenue of China's third telecommunications company totalled RMB165.97 billion
(US$26.69 billion) in the first half of 2014, up by 5% from RMB157.56 billion (US$25.34 billion) a year
earlier, thanks to increasing numbers of 3G customers. Its net profit rose 12%, from RMB10.23 billion
(US$1.64 billion) to RMB11.44 billion (US$1.84 billion). China Telecom received a TD-LTE license in
December 2013, and plans to launch large-scale 4G mobile services with the FDD-LTE standard, licenses
expected to be issued within the next two years. MIIT has authorized China Telecom to extend trials of its
hybrid TD-LTE/FDD LTE network to 40 cities, including Beijing, Dongguan, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and
Xiamen.

On July 8, Hutchison announced the exclusive introduction of NTT DoCoMo 's popular Japanese
Translator application in Hong Kong, which enables users to communicate with ease in Japanese, even if
they do not know the language. The app, developed by NTT, can translate spoken English, Mandarin and
Korean into written and spoken Japanese, and vice versa, on a mobile handset. Users need only to speak
into their smartphones and the app will automatically translate what they say into Japanese, displaying a
voice-to-text translation on screen and dictating the message audibly.

PCCW Ltd
Hong Kong-based PCCW Ltd 's (HKSE: 0008) first half revenue totalled HK$14.44 billion (US$1.86
billion), up by 13% from HK$12.82 billion (US$1.65 billion) a year earlier, while profit increased by
13.1%, from HK$1.45 billion (US$0.19 billion), to HK$1.64 billion (US$0.21 billion). The increase was
driven by continued demand for data center capacity and timely execution of projects.

In August, PCCW extended its support for Telecoms Sans Frontieres (TSF), the world's leading
telecommunications non-government organization (NGO), with further contributions for the next three
years. Founded in 1998, TSF is a humanitarian-aid, non-governmental organization specialising in
telecommunications in emergency situations for victims of natural disasters and conflicts, and to
humanitarian aid organisations. PCCW was the first Asian telco to support TSF.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

On August 4, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Ludian, Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province, caused 589 deaths
and injured 2,401 people. MIIT announced that the earthquake disabled 61 mobile communication base
stations and services from 16 fixed network access points. China Telecom , China Unicom and China
Mobile sent emergency repair personnel and vehicles to the disaster area. Because damaged roads made
access difficult, it was not known at publication time when full services would be restored.

Market Outlook

Page33of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The number of mobile subscribers in Hong Kong is likely to increase in second half 2014, due to the
strong and fiercely competitive mobile segment. China's telecoms industry is likely to grow as smartphone
penetration rises and the country expects to start commercial use of its homegrown 4G telecoms
technology by the beginning of 2015. China Telecom expects to receive its official licence for a fully
commercial FDD LTE rollout in early 2015.

India

Sector Overview

The number of wireless and wireline subscribers and the number of broadband subscribers picked up over
the last six months as the country's internet usage rose further. As of May 31, 2014, the number of
wireless and wireline subscribers was 938.34 million, up 3% from 915.19 million on December 31, 2013,
while the number of broadband subscribers increased by 18% to 65.33 million, from 55.20 million,
according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

The telecom industry aims to use social media such as Facebook , Twitter and YouTube to connect with
mobile users across the country. The platforms will help the industry engage with the 900 million Indian
mobile users on topics such as technological advances, health and scientific facts, expert views and other
industry issues.

In April 2014, India's fourth biggest mobile phone carrier Reliance Communications Ltd increased tariffs on
discounted and promotional plans by up to 20% for all its pre-paid customers and headline call tariffs to
1.6 paise every second from 1.5 paise. The move was part of its continued efforts to reduce free and
discounted minutes. It should also offset the ever-rising costs of input materials and continue to focus on
increasing the number of profitable or paid minutes on its network.
Top major player Bharti Airtel said in July it had more than 300 million customers for its mobile, fixed line,
digital subscriber line (DSL) and direct to home (DTH) services. As of May 31, 2014, Bharti had a 22.88%
share of the Indian wireless subscriber market, more than 208 million mobile phone subscribers and
3,347,309 wireline users, according to the TRAI.

The TRAI estimates the number of broadband subscribers reached 12.98 million at the end of October
2011, compared with 10.52 million a year earlier. With huge market potential, broadband subscription
numbers are set to continue to grow in the next few years, while the country moves forward with new
technology, especially in convergence.

Leading Companies

Bharti Airtel
Bharti's fourth quarter (ended March 31, 2014) revenue totalled Rs222.19 billion (US$3.71 billion), a
1.3% increase from Rs219.39 billion (US$3.66 billion) in the third quarter (ended December 31, 2013).
Its net income increased by 64.5%, from Rs6.23 billion (US$0.10 billion) to Rs10.25 billion (US$0.17
billion), thanks to less market competition.

Bharti launched its 4G services in Jalandhar in May 2014, enabling its customers to connect to high-speed
home broadband and internet on the move, allowing them to download ten movies in less than 30 minutes

Page34of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.and full holiday photo albums in less than five minutes anywhere, anytime. On February 14, Bharti and
Apple launched India's first 4G on mobile to give customers the 4G experience at 3G prices regardless of
location.

Reliance Communications Ltd

In June, India's fully integrated telecommunications service provider Reliance launched its Next-Gen 3G
services in the Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh-East circles. Reliance
covers more than 80% of India's fast-growing 3G data revenue market as smartphone sales rise. Reliance
has expanded its 3G footprint to 18 circles, consolidating its position as the leading data operator in the
Indian telecom industry.
Its fourth quarter revenue reached Rs56.71 billion (US$0.95 billion), up 5% from Rs54.03 billion
(US$0.90 billion) the previous quarter, while net profit increased by 44% to Rs1.56 billion (US$0.03
billion), from Rs1.08 billion (US$0.02 billion), primarily due to easing competition. On June 9, Reliance
introduced the first-of-its-kind free national roaming offer for post-paid and pre-paid GSM customers,
making all roaming incoming calls free on the RCOM network.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

In July 4, TRAI recommended that no new mobile number portability (MNP) licences be issued. The two
MNP service providers, Syniverse Technologies and MNP Interconnection Telecom, should not be
charged more for extending nationwide MNP. Syniverse provides business and network engineering
services and software for managing and interconnecting voice and data network systems, while MNP
Interconnection Telecom is a joint venture between US-based Telcordia Technologies Inc and Indian
enterprise, DTC Pvt Ltd. The two service providers were given MNP licences in 2009, and TRAI
recommended that the maintenance of their existing entry fees, performance bank guarantee (PBG) and
financial bank guarantees (FBG).

This is a complete U-turn from its September 2013 suggestions on nationwide MNP that the Department
of Telecommunications (DoT) may make necessary changes to the existing MNP service licence to
facilitate inter-service area porting, or full MNP. Trai has asked DoT to give telecom companies six months
to make suitable changes to their networks from the date the full MNP is approved.

Market Outlook

In the first half of 2014, continuous data traffic growth led to investment in additional capacity by telcos to
maintain growth. It is expected that higher adoption of data services, driven by the availability of
compatible mobile devices, affordable data plans and rapidly rising numbers of internet users, will be the
next growth driver. The number of Global System for Mobile (GSM) subscribers in India is likely to
continue to grow, from around 733 million in May 2014 to 780 million in December 2014.

Japan

Sector Overview

Japan's major operator NTT DoCoMo announced in May 2014 it would conduct 5G experimental trials
with six world-leading mobile technology vendors: Alcatel-Lucent , Ericsson, Fujitsu Ltd , NEC Corp ,
Nokia and Samsung Electronics . The trials, to begin in the second half 2014, will examine the potential of
5G mobile technologies to exploit frequency bands above 6GHz and to realize very high system capacity
per unit area.

They will also test new radio technologies' ability to support various applications, including
machine-to-machine (M2M) services. A new-generation cellular system due for commercial deployment
in 2020, 5G will enable ultra-high-speed data transmissions at more than 10Gbps, 1,000 times the
capacity of existing LTE networks, and allow connectivity of massive numbers of devices to support the
ever-expanding market for M2M services.

Internet search services provider Yahoo Japan Corp (TSE: 4689) announced plans to acquire SoftBank's
mobile internet service provider eAccess Ltd for Y324 billion (US$3.21 billion), but changed its mind in
May, saying that it would be better for the two companies to operate independently. SoftBank owns 42.6%
of Yahoo Japan and a 99.68% stake in eAccess but only 33.29% of the voting rights due to regulatory
restrictions. The planned acquisition was part of Yahoo 's expansion strategy in the wireless data and
voice sectors.

JEITA data shows that in the six-month period to May 2014, the total value of electronics for
telecommunications systems exported from Japan to other countries was Y1,295 million (US$12.82
million), up 11% from Y1,170 million (US$11.58 million) in the six-month period to November 2013.
According to telecommunications market research and consulting firm TeleGeography, NTT DoCoMo ,
the first company in Japan to launch LTE services commercially, in December 2010, passed the ten
million subscriber milestone in February 2013. NTT DoCoMo has developed an indoor base station and
antenna, compatible with the 1500MHz, 1700MHz and 2000MHz frequency bands, and started
commercial deployment on November 21, 2013, in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Aichi, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo
prefectures. The technology supports maximum downlink transmission speeds of 150Mbps and is suitable
for long-term evolution (LTE) technology.

Leading Companies

NTT DoCoMo
NTT DoCoMo 's operating revenue was down 3% to Y1,075.30 billion (US$10.65 billion) in second
quarter 2014, down from Y1,113.57 billion (US$11.02 billion) a year earlier. Its net income was down
14% to Y136.4 billion (US$1.35 billion), from Y158 billion (US$1.56 billion), primarily due to the impact
of discount programmes and lower sales of handsets. The number of mobile subscriptions grew by 1.5%
to 63,105,000 as of March 31, 2014, from 62,182,000 on December 31, 2013, while the number of prepaid
subscriptions dropped by 6% to 34,000, from 36,000.

To satisfy consumer demand for high-speed, high-quality voice and data services, NTT DoCoMo launched
its first VoLTE service on June 24. The service, which requires a subscription to extra-high speed network
Xi, enables users to access up to 150 Mbps high-speed LTE data communication during VoLTE voice
calls, and receives Area Mail disaster-information notifications while making VoLTE voice or video calls. Xi
and Area Mail, which are trademark services of NTT, are available only to subscribers in Japan.

KDDI Corp
KDDI 's operating revenue increased by 2%, from Y1,002.42 billion (US$9.92 billion) in second quarter
2013 to Y1,020.55 billion (US$10.10 billion) in the same period in 2014, due to higher mobile
communications revenues in the personal services segment, while net income rose by 67%, from Y68.17
billion (US$0.67 billion) to Y113.51 billion (US$1.12 billion).
In July, KDDI and Sumitomo Corp (TSE: SSUMY) agreed to joint telecommunications operations in
Myanmar with Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). Japan-based Sumitomo is involved in a
variety of social infrastructure projects such as power generation, telecommunications and railways in
countries throughout the world. KDDI and Sumitomo have set up a joint venture, KDDI Summit Global
Myanmar (KSGM), through which they will conduct their business in Myanmar. KDDI aims to bring
Japanese-quality fixed and mobile services to Myanmar and to upgrade the country's telecoms
infrastructure. MPT, formerly known as The Posts and Telecommunications Corp, provides postal,
telegraph, and telephone services throughout Myanmar.

Softbank Mobile Corp

Page36of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Softbank posted net sales of Y1,992.2 billion (US$19.72 billion) in second quarter 2014, up by 126%
from Y881.1 billion (US$8.72 billion) a year earlier. However, net income fell by 59%, from Y269.7
billion (US$2.67 billion) to Y111.3 billion (US$1.10 billion), mainly due to interest repayments on loans
to finance its Sprint Nextel Corpacquisition in 2013. Softbank signed a Y1.98 trillion (US$20 billion) loan
facility with a number of banks to refinance its previous one-year bridge loan for the Sprintacquisition. In
August, Softbank announced that it had dropped its bid to acquire US carrier T-Mobile US for US$40
billion, after regulatory resistance showed no signs of softening despite months of lobbying. US regulators
insisted that they wanted to keep the number of major wireless carriers at four.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

New guidelines for the introduction of disaster-resilient telecommunications networks in Japan aim to
improve emergency response in the event of a major disaster. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications (MIC) in July announced guidelines for the introduction of disaster-resilient
telecommunications networks following from the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The
new measures include telecommunications systems with disaster-resilient features and the capability to
support early recovery from disasters to be part of smart grid deployment.

The new system will enable emergency responders to coordinate action, allowing responders and
members of the public to share and receive information, and to provide early warnings and critical
updates. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami damaged 1.9 million fixed communication lines and 29,000
base stations, and more than 80% of fixed and mobile communications breakdowns were caused by
widespread and prolonged power outages.

Market Outlook

Continuous investment by major players in LTE networks should ensure that Japan's mobile market
continues to grow in the second half 2014. Growth is expected to be driven by the handset market, mainly
in the smartphones segment. Shipments of devices such as PCs, tablets, and smartphones to the highly
developed Japanese telecoms market are expected to pick up significantly over the next six months.

Singapore

Sector Overview

In July 2014, major operator Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel ) (SES : Z74) launched the
world's first commercial 4G service with a 300 Mbps peak connection speed, available on the Huawei

Leading Companies

Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel )

On June 16, 2014, SingTel launched Easy Mobile, Asia's first postpaid mobile service, which allows users
to customise their tariff plans each month to suit their lifestyle needs and budgets. Customers can quickly
and conveniently tweak their voice, SMS and data bundle while on the move via the MySingTel
smartphone app or the Easy Mobile online portal. Easy Mobile uses digital platforms to handle all
transactions and serve customer needs, including post-sales support.
SingTel 's net profit totalled S$881 million (US$704.98 million) in first quarter 2014, a 2% drop from
S$898 million (US$718.58 million) in fourth quarter 2013, while revenue increased by 0.5%, from S$4.13
billion (US$3.30 billion) to S$4.15 billion (US$3.32 billion), mainly due to a growing mobile customer
base and higher take-up of data services.

StarHub Ltd
StarHub's operating revenue increased by 1%, from S$571.4 million (US$457.23 million) in first quarter
2014 to S$576.4 million (US$461.24 million) in the second quarter, while net income grew by 12%, from
S$84.2 million (US$67.38 million) to S$94.3 million (US$75.46 million), thanks to its growing customer
base. In May, StarHub launched its innovative dual-network home broadband solution that maximises
wireless broadband coverage and speed. StarHub's 500Mbps fibre home broadband plan includes
100Mbps cable home broadband subscription and two complimentary premium wireless networking
devices, giving customers greater broadband connectivity throughout the home.

StarHub announced in June an extended trial for its rich communications services (RCS) app, expecting to
officially launch the product before December 2014. RCS was developed by the GSM Association, a
group of more than 800 mobile operators and related companies in more than 200 countries. StarHub
started trials in May for the app that will allow users to share video and photos, make voice calls and send
text messages.

MobileOne Ltd (M1)
M1's operating revenue totalled S$479.8 million (US$383.94 million) in the first half of 2014, down by 2%
from S$487.5 million (US$390.10 million) a year earlier, but net profit rose by 8%, from S$80.2 million
(US$64.18 million) to S$86.7 million (US$69.38 million), thanks to growth in its post-paid mobile and
fixed customer base, and by higher mobile data revenue.

In May 2014, M1 launched a new service, which allows customers using Windows Phones to pay for apps
on their M1 bills. The service offers several features to prevent accidental or fraudulent purchases,
including the option to require a Microsoft Wallet PIN number to confirm a purchase. Most Windows
Phone devices have the option to charge purchases to the customer's M1 bill as the default payment
method, unless the user chooses alternative payment options.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

From January 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) Singapore requires anyone
sending promotion or marketing messages to a Singapore phone number to first check whether that
number is listed in the new national Do Not Call (DNC) Registry. Organizations or individuals are required
to set up an account with the DNC Registry and submit lists of telephone numbers for checking. DNC
provisions under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) prohibit organisations from sending
marketing messages (in the form of voice calls, text or fax messages) to Singapore telephone numbers,
including mobile, fixed-line, residential and business numbers, on the DNC Registry.

The registry comes under new PDPA rules, the rest of which took effect on July 2, since when
organizations that check their marketing list with DNC Registry can rely on the results returned for up to 30
days. Between June 1 to July 1, 2014 (both dates inclusive), all results received during this transition

Page38of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.period were valid until July 31, 2014. Breaches of the new legislation could result in fines of up to S$1
million (US$0.80 million).

Market Outlook
more than half of the island by the end of October 2014 and nationwide coverage is expected by the end
March 2015.

South Korea

Sector Overview

In South Korea, subsidies have long been a common telco strategy to make smartphones more affordable
to attract customers. Regulators have used fines, business suspensions and stern warnings to make
mobile carriers end subsidies, but to no avail. However, in March 2014, three major South Korean carriers,
SK Telecom Co , KT Corp and LG Uplus , agreed to end illegal subsidies to stabilize the local market. The
regulator also ordered SK Telecom and LG Uplus to suspend their mobile business for seven and 14
days, respectively, and fined all three operators KRW30.4 billion (US$0.03 billion) won for previously
offering illegal subsidies.

In April, LG Uplus announced the nation's first unlimited mobile service package, followed by
announcements of similar services by SK Telecom and KT Corp . LG Uplus ' LTE 80 and LTE 85 plans
offer unlimited LTE data use, and unlimited voice calls and messaging for KRW80,000 (US$80). The
package includes services such as U+HDTV, U+Professional Baseball and Ticket Planet. SK Telecom ,
the world's first provider to offer a LTE-Advanced network, in 2013, will introduce three LTE data plans
providing customers with unlimited LTE data use, voice calls, and text messages.

In June, South Korea announced that it is collaborating with the European Commission (EC) on a global
definition of 5G and in 5G research, to meet the need for more internet speed. South Korea's Samsung
will handle global marketing to consumers worldwide. The move will streamline the global standardization
of 5G tech and allow companies to share research, aiming to make South Korea and the EC leaders in 5G
technology.

Industry Size and Value
In 2008, South Korea announced that it would invest KRW60 billion (US$0.06 billion) in 4G and 5G
technology development, aiming to have the biggest mobile phone market share by 2012. Thanks to
substantial investment in R&D, and the collaboration of the public and private sectors, smartphone uptake
has significantly increased since 2011. A high-speed internet network makes Wi-Fi widely available, even
in underground trains, making South Korea the leading force in telecommunications.

South Korea became a world leader in distribution and use of near field communication (NFC) technology
in mobile devices in 2012, with KT and SK Telecom selling more than three million NFC-enabled phones
that allow customers to use their phones to pay transit fares and conduct other business at NFC terminals.

South Koreans were early tech adopters and remain the most tech-savvy consumers, particularly
receptive to new technologies, and mobile penetration exceeded 110% in 2013, driven by the popularity of
smartphones. In 2009, the Government announced an ultra-broadband convergence network (UBcN) plan
to establish an information and communications environment. The plan aimed at 1Gbs speeds on fixed
lines or 10Mbs on wireless by the end of 2013 by upgrading the UBcN to a 46 million-subscriber network
with speeds of 1Gbps.

Leading Companies

SK Telecom Co
SK Telecom 's operating revenue totalled KRW4,201.9 billion (US$4.20 billion) in first quarter 2014,
down 2% from KRW4,294.8 billion (US$4.29 billion) a year earlier. Its net income totalled KRW267.3
billion (US$0.27 billion), a 9% decrease from KRW293.7 billion (US$0.29 billion), primarily due to a
temporary rise in marketing expenses. SK Telecom had 18,816,000 smartphone subscribers as of March
31, 2014, up by 3% from 18,286,000 in the previous quarter, while the number of LTE subscribers
increased by 10%, from 13,487,000 to 14,773,000.

In June 2014, SK Telecom launched a 225Mbps LTE-Advanced service, making it the first among 300
telcos in 107 countries with commercialized LTE to use the technology on smartphones. It offers speeds of
up to 225Mbps, enabling customers to download a 1GB movie in 37 seconds. Customers will not be
charged extra for the service as SK Telecom aims to expand the market for diverse convergence services
based on faster data communications.

Page39of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.KT Corp
KT Corp made a net loss of KRW41 billion (US$0.04 billion) in first quarter 2014, compared with a loss
of KRW542.5 billion (US$0.54 billion) in the previous quarter, while operating revenue declined by 6%
from KRW6,214.5 billion (US$6.21 billion) to KRW5,846.1 billion (US$5.85 billion). The decrease was
mainly due to business suspension orders from telecom authorities in the first quarter.

In June, KT announced plans to sell KT Capital Co Ltd and KT Rental Co Ltd to focus on its information
and communications business, hoping to increase competitiveness and growth. On February 24, it
announced collaboration with Radisys Corp (NASDAQ : RSYS) to deliver Intel ?-based small cell solutions
across its LTE WARP+ network, allowing customers to benefit from the increased capacity and coverage
that small cells bring to the network. US-based Radisys is a market leader in wireless infrastructure
solutions for telecom, aerospace and defence applications.

LG Uplus

South Korea's third largest mobile carrier LG Uplus 's revenue for first quarter 2014 declined by 6% to
KRW2,780.4 billion (US$2.78 billion), from KRW2,948.0 billion (US$2.95 billion) the previous quarter.
Its net income totalled KRW26.8 billion (US$0.03 billion), down 44% from KRW48.1 billion (US$0.05
billion), mainly due to strong competition in early January and increased marketing costs. As of May 31,
2014, LG had 2,983,759 broadband subscribers and 4,844,409 telephony subscribers.

LG Uplus and Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions
provider, announced the completion of the world's first commercial network field trial of the aggregation of
three different band carriers (3CC CA) on June 9. The aggregation will enable LG to meet higher
throughput demand and efficiently deliver ultra-fast data speeds.

The KCC ordered KT to inform customers about what happened and to allow them to check on a special
website if they had been affected. The KCC also announced, in March 2014, that it was investigating retail
stores selling mobile services, saying that retailers caught selling data can face fines of up to KRW30
million (US$0.03 million). According to the KCC, the investigation has no deadline and every shop will be
investigated.

Market Outlook

In the second half of 2014, deployments of LTE will continue to drive revenue growth, with LTE becoming
the dominant technology in 2015. By the end of 2014, the country should have 38 million LTE
subscribers. Mobile SIM penetration is expected to increase from 117% in 2013 to around 120% by the
end 2014, while smartphone penetration is likely to rise to 60% from 53%. Driven by LTE and fibre
broadband, overall telecoms retail revenue for the region is likely to increase, along with mobile data
revenue, to US$70 billion in December 2014, up 4% from US$67.3 billion in December 2013.
