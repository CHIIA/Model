Apple buyout Apple is orchestrating a $3.2 billion ($3.7 billion) acquisition of Beats Electronics. If the
deal is completed, it would be the largest purchase in Apple's history. Chinese inflation eases China's
inflation eased in April, giving the government more leeway to stimulate the slowing economy. The rise
in politically sensitive food prices eased to 2.3 per cent from the previous month's 4.1 per cent. Beijing
launched a mini-stimulus in March based on higher spending on building railways and other public
works.
Wind the answer Trustpower is looking to its Australian wind farm investments to restore earnings
momentum after a sluggish result from its New Zealand electricity assets pulled full year net earnings
down by 6.7 per cent. Most to blame for the decreased earnings were lower electricity sales by volume,
lower wholesale electricity power prices and the impact of the strong New Zealand dollar on Australian
earnings.

News Corp slides

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is confident advertisers will return to its Australian newspapers, despite a
21 per cent slide in revenue. Revenue from the local newspaper business fell by US$103 million
($119.2 million) in the three months to March 31, compared to the same period a year ago.

Aussie dollar uncertain

The path of the Australian dollar is a source of uncertainty for the Reserve Australia Bank. It expects a
lower exchange rate, which would boost economic growth by improving competitiveness, but give the
economy an inflationary impulse through higher import prices. Just how quickly the mining boom winds
down, and how the rest of the economy responds to low interest rates, are key uncertainties, it said.
