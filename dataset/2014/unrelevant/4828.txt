(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, August 29 (Fitch)
Fitch Ratings, Singapore/Sydney, 29 August 2014: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Australia-based Fortescue
Metals Group Limited's (Fortescue) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and its senior unsecured rating
at 'BB+'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable. The agency has also affirmed the company's senior
unsecured and senior secured debt, issued through FMG Resources (August 2006) Pty Ltd, at 'BB+' and
'BBB-', respectively. Fortescue's operating and financial profiles closely mirror that of an investment-grade
rated company. In particular, Fortescue is the fourth-largest iron ore producer in the world, and it has a
low-cost base, which results in strong profit margins. The completion of the company's expansion project
in March 2014 increased the company's processing capacity to 155 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and
helped strengthen its cost position further.

Fitch also expects the company to reduce its FFO adjusted gross leverage (leverage) to below 2x. Fitch's
expectations are based on Fortescue repaying a further USD2.5bn of debt over the next 18-24 months to
achieve its publicly stated 40% gearing (measured by debt/(debt and equity)) and 62% Fe (cost and
freight) price - a benchmark price for iron ore - remaining at or above USD90 per dry metric tonne (dmt).
Fortescue would need to demonstrate a long-term commitment to maintaining a capital structure that is in
line with a 'BBB' category rating and a reduced risk appetite before Fitch would consider positive rating
action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Higher Output, Lower Costs: Fortescue successfully produced ore at an
annualised rate of 155mtpa in the fourth quarter of the financial year ended 30 June 2014 (FY14),
including a higher 160mtpa rate in the month of June 2014. This compared with 124.2 million tonnes that
were shipped in FY14. The company's C1 costs (cash costs) reduced 23% to USD34/wet metric tonne
(wmt) from a year earlier, driven by lower stripping costs at Solomon, an improved product strategy, a 54%
increase in output that improved economies of scale, as well as a lower Australian dollar-US dollar
exchange rate. Strong Profits Drive Deleveraging: Fortescue's EBITDA (as defined by Fitch) rose 68% in
FY14 to USD5.6bn, with EBITDA margin increasing to 48% from 41%. The agency expects Fortescue's
EBITDA margin to remain at around 42%-46% over the medium term, provided the 62% Fe price doesn't
fall below USD90/dmt on a sustained basis (for more information, see "Updating Fitch's Mid-Cycle
Commodity Price Assumptions", dated 28 July 2014, on www.fitchratings.com). The company repaid
USD3.1bn of debt in FY14 and has committed to repay a further USD500m in October 2014. Leverage is
likely to reach around 2.1x in FY15 after this repayment and amid Fitch's expectation that iron ore prices
would weaken from the previous year's levels. This compares with 1.8x in FY14 when iron ore prices
improved and 4.0x in FY13. Leverage could fall further to around 1.8x by FYE15 if the company calls an
additional USD2bn of its outstanding notes. Strong Liquidity, Flexible Structure: Fortescue had cash
reserves of USD2.4bn at end-June 2014, while its earliest mandatory debt repayment of USD1bn falls due
only in 2017. Furthermore, Fitch expects Fortescue to generate strong post-dividend free cash flow, as the
company's capex will fall to maintenance levels over the medium term. Fortescue has considerable
flexibility around its debt structure and repayments because its secured credit facility, which accounts for
over 50% of FY14 debt, is repayable at the company's discretion. Furthermore, each tranche of its senior
unsecured notes, which account for the remainder of its debt, can be called early. Lack of Diversification:
Fortescue has limited business diversification compared with its higher rated international peers. It has
only one product, iron ore, which it sells predominantly in the Chinese market. Secured Credit Facility:
The rating on the secured credit facility is notched up one level from Fortescue's 'BB+' IDR to reflect the
additional provision of quality collateral, including mining tenements. This uplift for a 'BB+' rated company
is consistent with Fitch's "Recovery Ratings and Notching Criteria for Non-Financial Corporate Issuers"
criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions
