SYDNEY—Goodman Fielder Ltd. rejected a 1.27 billion Australian dollar (US$1.18 billion) foreign
takeover offer that some of its shareholders believe has every chance of nudging higher.
Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. and Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. pledged to continue pursuing
the Australian breads-and-spreads maker—which Monday dismissed their joint proposal saying it
sought to exploit a period of short-term financial instability.

Goodman Fielder manufactures some of Australia's most recognizable food brands including Meadow
Lea margarine, Praise mayonnaise and Wonder White bread. Wilmar has been touted as a potential
buyer ever since it took a 10% stake in Goodman Fielder two years ago.
Wilmar and First Pacific conditionally offered A$0.65 a share to acquire the Sydney-based food
manufacturer, which ended trading on Thursday before a public holiday at A$0.55. Earlier this month,
Goodman Fielder issued a stern profit warning amid growing competition from supermarket
own-brands and a rise in wholesale New Zealand milk prices.

"The Wilmar bid appears opportunistic given the recent profit downgrades have largely been driven by
one-off factors we think will reverse," said Paul Skamvougeras, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at
Perpetual Ltd., which owns 12% of Goodman Fielder. "We're encouraging the company to continue a
dialogue."

Goodman Fielder's shares leapt as much as 19% in Sydney trading to A$0.655 a share, as investors
bet that a higher bid was likely. Despite Monday's jump, the stock remains about 15% lower than
where it traded a year ago.

Goodman Fielder recently warned of worsening trading conditions in both Australia and New Zealand.
In its profit warning, the company said earnings before interest and tax in the year through June
would likely be 10%-15% below an analyst consensus of A$180 million. Earlier, it had estimated
earnings would be broadly in line with the A$185.6 million year-earlier figure.

Goodman Fielder's revenue in Australia has been squeezed by the major supermarket
chains—Woolworths Ltd. and Wesfarmers Ltd.-owned Coles—becoming more aggressive on pricing
with their own-label bread and other staples. In response, Goodman Fielder has had to spend more
on promoting its own brands.

Wilmar and First Pacific described their proposal as "compelling," citing the 27% premium on the
volume-weighted average of its shares since the profit warning. It also "compares favorably with
recent relevant comparable transactions," the companies said in a joint statement.
First Pacific and Wilmar said they would look to hold further talks with the board aimed at conducting
due diligence and working up a binding proposal for shareholders. Goodman Fielder said its board
would be constructive in considering any further proposal.

A$0.75, but raised concern over Wilmar's wherewithal to lift the bid substantially from the current offer.
Goodman Fielder has sold several businesses considered noncore over the past year and a half as it
seeks to strengthen its finances by paying down debt. It recently sold its New Zealand
meats-and-pizza businesses to Mommas Frozen Products Ltd., and its biscuits division to Green's
Food Holdings. It has also looked to shave costs by closing down one of its meat-processing facilities.
Goodman Fielder said on Monday it was planning to save an extra A$25 million largely through job
cuts to be made in the three months through June, while also reviewing its New Zealand dairy
business.
