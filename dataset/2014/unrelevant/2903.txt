ONE of Victoria’s largest and most productive farming operations is expected to sell for more than
$20 million.

New Zealander Allan McCracken — who is one of a syndicate of owners — said the landmark
Labertouche Farm was going on to the market, eight years after the group purchased it.

The 363ha farm, in a high rainfall region of Gippsland, has been running 1050 dairy cows and raising
280,000 broiler chickens every two months. The area has an average annual rainfall around
1000-1100 mm.

Allan said the two enterprises complemented each other well. “We bought it because it is an iconic
property and situated in an excellent location in a very high rainfall area, under the Baw Baw ranges,”
he said.

The litter from the chickens has been used as fertiliser for the property’s pastures.
Allan said the other major synergy was that the dairy farm provided a great “biosecurity land bank” or
buffer to any neighbouring properties, thereby reducing the risk of diseases coming on to the farm.
Allan said the group decided to sell because various members were considering other opportunities.

And, there was now a great degree of interest in agriculture in Australia, he said.

“The industry is growing and there is more and more interest, so it is a good time to put it on the
market and see who is interested.” Allan said there had already been strong interest shown n
Labertouche from both Australian and international people.
“The free trade agreement with China is very exciting and bodes well for the next decade of farming
in Australia,” he said.

“The Australian dollar has been high, making it hard for exporters, but it has now come back; so these
two things combined are very positive.” Since buying the property, Allan said continual improvements
had been made. The property is to be sold on a walk-in-walk-out basis.

The land sits on seven titles, with five residences.
The major poultry and dairy infrastructure includes a 60-bale rotary cow shed and six-tunnel
sheet-ventilated poultry sheds, plus a permanent water supply.

Labertouche Farm has strict biosecurity guidelines and inspection is by appointment only.
