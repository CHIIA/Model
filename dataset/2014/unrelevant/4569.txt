Overnight Markets Update

TD

------------------------

US Treasuries rallied overnight following weaker-than-expected US retail sales data, with moves
particularly pronounced in the belly and long end of the curve. The curve flattened with the 2-year bond
yield easing 2bps to 0.38% and the 10-year bond yield declining 5bps to 2.61%.

Australian bond futures also rallied across the curve but underperformed US Treasuries at the long end.
The implied 3-year yield declined 4bps to 2.85% and the implied 10-year yield fell 4bps to 3.80%.

US equities were little changed overnight. The S&P 500 advanced in early trade briefly breaching 1,900
for the first time, before retreating later in the session to finished unchanged at 1,897. The Dow Jones
rose a marginal 0.1% to 16,715, while the Nasdaq eased 0.3% to 4,130.

European equities rose slightly on the back of solid corporate earnings results. The German DAX gained
0.5% to 9,754, the Euro Stoxx 50 closed 0.1% higher at 3,212 and the FTSE 100 increased 0.3% to
6,873.

Australian SPI futures rose 0.1% to 5,492.

In currency markets, the USD managed to maintain its recent gains despite weaker-than-expected
economic data driving US yields lower. Gains were focused against the EUR following weaker ZEW
expectations data there, and reports that the German Bundesbank stood ready to support the ECB in
embarking on an unconventional policy path. That said, the USD held up strongly across the board, with
JPY also unable to regain strength.
The AUD also failed to rally against the USD but retraced the small losses seen after the soft Chinese
activity data yesterday. Last night's Commonwealth Budget had little impact on the AUD as many major
measures had been pre-announced and policy expectations had already adjusted.

Indicative trading levels: AUD/USD 0.9357, AUD/EUR 0.6828, AUD/GBP 0.5561, AUD/NZD 1.0851,
AUD/JPY 95.69, AUD/CNY 5.8280, EUR/USD 1.3703, GBP/USD 1.6826, USD/JPY 102.27.
Oil prices rose overnight. WTI futures reached a two-week high, rising 1.2% to USD101.87 per barrel on
forecasts of falling US crude inventories as production increases. Brent futures gained 0.8% to
USD109.35 per barrel.
The spot gold price fell 0.1% to USD1,293.5 per ounce.
Base metals prices declined overnight. Copper (-0.6%) fell for the first time in four sessions following
disappointing economic data released yesterday for China. Aluminium (-0.3%), nickel (-1.4%), lead
(-0.5%) and zinc (-0.9%) also declined. Meanwhile, thermal coal futures gained 0.1% to USD78.5 per
tonne and spot iron ore closed 0.3% higher at USD103.0 per tonne.

oil (+0.5%), canola (+2.8%) and cocoa (+1.3%) all rose, while wheat (-0.4%) and cotton (-0.4%) declined.

Key drivers

------------

Global equities edged higher overnight in sight of record highs despite some softer economic data
releases.

Indeed, the S&P 500 touched above 1,900 for the first time but did not hold this level into the close, while
key European equity indices reached six-year highs.
However, US governmentbonds rallied strongly across the curve, following weaker-than-expected US
retail sales data. Australian bond futures followed suit, rallying around 4bps across the curve to reverse an
initial sell off earlier in the session after the Australian Budget was not as hard hitting as expected in the
near term (see below). There were also rumours last night the Bundesbank would support the ECB in a
package of stimulus measures, raising speculation of policy action at the central bank's next meeting in
June. * In the United States, the key economic release was April retail sales data which disappointed.
Headline retail sales rose 0.1% m/m (mkt: +0.4% m/m), with retail spending for the 'control' group - which
feeds directly into GDP - falling 0.1% m/m.

ANZ's international economists' view is this could suggest some hesitancy in household spending as Q2
gets under way and is illustrative of the patchy nature of the recovery. Despite this, there were upward
revisions for March, with the upward trend in underlying sales remaining intact. * In Europe, the ZEW
survey for the euro area fell to 55.2 in May from 61.2. The steady decline in ZEW expectations suggests
that our key euro area lead indicators have peaked in level terms and could gradually consolidate and
step down through 2014. It is worth noting that the situation in Ukraine and Russia may have exaggerated
the fall in expectations in May. * In China, monthly economic data for April disappointed. Retail sales rose
11.9% y/y (mkt: +12.2% y/y), fixed asset investment increased 17.3% y/y (mkt: +17.7% y/y), and industrial
production growth was 8.7% y/y (mkt: +8.9% y/y). ANZ's China economists believe that if this trend were
to be extended into May and June, China's Q2 GDP growth could remain below 7.5% y/y. As a result,
their view is that it is time for the People's Bank to support the economy by cutting Reserve Requirement
Ratios (RRRs). * In Australia yesterday, the Government unveiled a mild tightening of fiscal policy in the
2014-15 Budget (with a deficit of AUD30bn forecast for 20114-15) and it set the ball rolling on its
long-term aspiration of returning the Budget balance to surplus of at least 1% of GDP within a decade.

Most of the savings announced in the Budget will impact beyond the next election due in 2016 with the
biggest changes to impact beyond the four-year estimate period.

The additional near-term tightening of fiscal policy contained in the Budget will be quite modest, and had
already been broadly factored into our growth forecasts, but will increase from 2015-16.
This Budget will be a mild headwind for the recovery in the non-mining economy that is now getting under
way. While estimating the overall effect on the economy from fiscal policy is very uncertain, we expect it to
have a modest drag on growth, on average, of roughly .25-.5ppts per annum.

The biggest changes in this Budget are around the structure of government payments and receipts with a
reduction in welfare, health and education spending as well as the first steps in reforming retirement
income arrangements. Many of the biggest Budget savings in the medium to long term are from shedding
spending commitments in health and education to the State governments, opening the way to major
reforms of the taxing and spending mix within the Federation. * In an interesting first gauge of the likely
impact on consumers from the Budget, the ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index fell a further
2.4% in the week ending 11 May.

Confidence declined almost 11% over the past three weeks when various policy leaks began receiving
significant media attention.
Also released yesterday, momentum in housing finance continued to softened in March, falling 1.0% m/m
(ANZ: -1.5% m/m; mkt: +1.0% m/m). However, finance remains only marginally below last month's peak
and 18.3% higher than year-ago levels.

The Northern Territory's 2014-15 budget also showed an improvement with a balanced budget expected
from next financial year due to improved expectations of revenues, especially the GST. The budget
projects a general government operating surplus of AUD63m in 2014-15, from an expected deficit of
AUD208m at the mid-year update in December last year.

Page272of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The surplus is expected to improve to AUD99m in 2015-16 (from a previous forecast of a AUD94m
deficit). A small surplus of AUD69m is expected in 2016-17 and a AUD1m surplus is projected for
2017-18.

Today, there are no key data releases for Australia.
