2341 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australia has lifted the last of its sanctions on Fiji following successful
democratic elections last month, says Julie Bishop, Australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a
statement ahead of a visit to Fiji. "I look forward to meeting Prime Minister Bainimarama and other
members of Fiji's Cabinet and Parliament and to reaffirming Australia's undertaking to building a more
dynamic, mutually beneficial relations with Fiji." Ms. Bishops adds Australia has also invited Fiji to join a
program that would allow its people to visit Australia to undertake seasonal work. Furthermore, it has
committed A$16 million to a four-year initiative to support economic governance and public-sector
linkages in Fiji and A$8.8 million to a private-sector-development initiative to support Fiji's tourism and
horticulture sectors. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2331 GMT [Dow Jones]--Currency markets were happy to take profit on U.S. dollar longs, despite
strength the U.S. 3Q GDP overnight, says ANZ in a strategy note. The strength in growth was attributed
to rising U.S. defence spending thus looked-through by markets. The trend for U.S. dollar remains
relatively strong, but currency markets are running well ahead of bond and equity markets, ANZ adds.
Expect U.S. data to continue to support USD ahead of the weekend. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

2328 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY may wobble in midmorning on flows related to commercial trade
settlement ahead of the end-of-month book closing, but then get a boost on hopes for more-aggressive
investment approach by the GPIF, says a Japanese bank senior dealer. "Basically, the JPY will likely
weaken against its major rivals," says the dealer. Nikkei reports GPIF will likely increase the portion
allotted to foreign bonds and stocks to a combined 40%, higher than about 30% previously expected. A
shift in the GPIF's assets toward more foreign assets could help support a higher USD/JPY. The pair is
now at 109.37. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones]--The composition of ANZ Banking's (ANZ.AU) full-year result was broadly in line
with expectations, but with earnings and the dividend modestly beating the market's forecasts it should
be well received, Credit Suisse suggests. In the opening minutes of trading, ANZ's shares are up 0.7% at
A$33.48, in line with its peers. The brokerage says in the plus column, ANZ's equity Tier 1 capital ratio
improved strongly and there was a sizable improvement in asset quality, but on the other side there was
a further decline in ANZ's international & institutional banking margin and negative sequential "jaws,"
industry speak for the difference between income and costs. It has an outperform stance and
A$37.50/share target. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones] National Australia Bank's (NAB.AU) accelerated efforts to exit underperforming
assets prompt Bell Potter to lift its target to A$37.40/share from A$36.50, with a buy recommendation
maintained. It notes the target isn't demanding for a "turnaround" stock and 12.2 times expected FY16
earnings and 1.6 times book value. NAB's FY14 cash profit was in line with the bank's earlier guidance,
held back as expected by A$1.5 billion in U.K. charges and write-downs. NAB is up 0.7% at A$34.87.

2310 GMT [Dow Jones]--Investors are likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to AMP's (AMP.AU)
planned acquisition of a stake in China Life Pensions Co., UBS says. The brokerage says it was
somewhat surprised by the deal, given AMP's Asian expansion has so far been targeted toward
investment management via AMP Capital. UBS says it accepts AMP's comments that this is a relatively
small investment and the risk of further capital drawdowns appears low. But Australian insurers have to

time frames in China. AMP has agreed to buy a 19.99% stake in CLPC, the largest pension firm in
China by assets under management. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2308 GMT [Dow Jones]--Two key drivers of tradables inflation in Australia have been moving recently.
The Australian dollar has fallen 6% since early September, while prices of Brent and WTI are down over
20% since the June highs, and Tapis crude is down over 30%. Ben Jarman, economist at JPMorgan said
the oil price plunge is bigger than the Aussie dollar fall in an absolute sense, though empirical rules of
thumb would suggest that the two influences should have roughly offsetting effects on inflation. Jarman
said the netting out of the two effects is inflation negative and the RBA could revise lower its forecasts at
a quarterly statement on Friday. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

2305 GMT [Dow Jones]--Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AU) has secured a significant premium from Coca-Cola
(KO) for a 29.4% stake in its Indonesian business, says UBS. But that begs the question: If it is such a
good deal, why did Coca-Cola Amatil not go it alone and debt-fund capex? Coke is paying US$500
million for its stake in Coca-Cola Amatil's Indonesian business. That implies an enterprise value of
A$1.6 billion for the combined Indonesia and Papua New Guinea division versus UBS's valuation of
A$1.26 billion. The challenge now is that Coke will want increased volume and market share, while
Coca-Cola Amatil needs improved earnings and return on capital. That's not easy given rising wages and
transport costs, and the depreciating Indonesian rupiah. "Frankly, (it) raises the prospect in our minds
that Indonesia might be worth more to someone else than is currently being recognised in the Coca-Cola
Amatil share price," UBS says. UBS rates Coca-Cola Amatil at neutral with a A$9.20/share price target.
CCL last traded at A$9.07. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
2301 GMT [Dow Jones] The New Zealand Debt Management Office has appointed its joint lead
managers of the syndicate as it works toward the launch of the a new 2035 inflation-linked bond later this
year. It says New Zealand branch of Deutsche Bank AG, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., the
Australian branch of UBS AG and Westpac Banking Corp. would be the joint lead managers of the
launch. The office adds it plans to issue by way of syndication up to NZ$1.5 billion of the new 20-year
bond "subject to market conditions." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2257 GMT [Dow Jones]--Google Inc. (GOOGL) is facing more pressure to pay publishers in Europe
when the Internet giant shows summaries of stories in its news search results. Spain's parliament
approved new intellectual property laws that allow news publishers to charge aggregators like Google
each time they display news content in search results, starting Jan. 1, according to the Associated Press.
Google told the AP it was disappointed with the outcome. There's a similar law in Germany and earlier
this month Google said it would stop posting snippets from several large German newspapers, rather
than pay for the right to post them. (alistair.barr@wsj.com)

2255 GMT [Dow Jones]--Food makers Kraft (KRFT) and Kellogg (K) are turning their attention from
cash-strapped consumers to a bigger problem: The rapidly changing tastes of consumers that is causing
grocery sales to shift to more fresh and prepared foods from canned and packaged food. "Views on
health and wellness are evolving, and that's impacting the business more than economic pressure,"
Kellogg Chief Executive John Bryant said in an interview on Thursday. Sales at Kellogg's most important
segment, U.S. morning foods, fell 4.8% to $841 million, while U.S. snacks sales fell 4.2% to $849
million. (annie.gasparro@wsj.com)

[Dow Jones] 22:50 GMT UBS lifts its 12-month target price on Freightways (FRE.NZ) to NZ$5.80 from
NZ$5.30 but retains its neutral rating. It notes its 1Q result was positive and "shows the strong operating
leverage FRE can exhibit, with adjusted revenue increasing 10% for both Express Packaging and
Information Management." UBS also lifted its growth assumptions for the remainder of FY15 for
Freightways. It now expects Ebitda to reach NZ$96.5 million versus a prior view of NZ$90.3 million and
says net profit will increase to NZ$50.9 million versus its prior forecast of NZ$46.5 million.
