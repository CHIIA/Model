The pursuit of higher yields for commercial property is driving Asian investment into Australia
with Far East Organisation yesterday adding a second Perth property to its portfolio.
The Aspen Group has agreed to sell the 17-storey Septimus Roe Square to Far East for $91
million in a deal expected to settle later this year.

Together with the $205 million purchase of Harbour Town in West Perth in October and office
towers in Sydney, the Singaporean property company has invested almost $700 million in
Australia in the past six months.
The Septimus Roe sale was negotiated by Colliers International’s Ian Mickle and Knight Frank
managing director John Corbett.
Mr Corbett said property wealth created in Singapore, China and Malaysia was substantial and
higher yields and the weaker Australian dollar was attracting Asian buyers.

“The yield for Septimus Roe was close to 10 per cent . . . more attractive investment than
Singapore, where yields are around 4 per cent,” he said.

Aspen chief executive Clem Salwin said it would cut debt.
