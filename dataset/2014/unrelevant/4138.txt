Australian coal producer Yancoal Wednesday posted a net loss of A$192.7 million ($179 million) for
January-June, narrowing from a net loss of A$522.7 million in the same period a year earlier, but
warned it expected oversupply to continue to keep seaborne coal prices weak.
The miner, considered a bellwether for the Australian coal industry, attributed the loss to an overly
strong Australian dollar and a prolonged downturn in seaborne coal prices in H1, but noted the loss had
narrowed from a year earlier after it improved the operational performance of its mines and
implemented a new regional reporting structure.

"We are maximizing yields via product optimization and responding to new marketing opportunities for
Yancoal's existing blending strategies," company CEO Reinhold Schmidt said in a half-year financial
report to the Australian Securities Exchange.
Yancoal's equity share of saleable production from its mines rose 4% year on year to 7.9 million mt in
H1, of which 4.2 million mt was thermal coal and 3.7 million mt coking coal.
The company's coal operations in the state of New South Wales -- Austar, Ashton, Moolarben,
Gloucester and Donaldson -- produced 8.4 million mt of saleable coal in H1, while its Yarrabee and
50%-owned Middlemount operations in neighboring Queensland produced 3.1 million mt. The
company did not provide year-on-year comparative data in the report.

Yancoal said it was now sharing rail and port facilities to reduce contract overhangs and associated
costs and increasing blending opportunities to optimize its product mix.
The company confirmed its production target for the 2014 calendar year at 16.5 million-17 million mt.
Revenue from Yancoal's coal sales fell 9% in H1 to A$654.5 million from A$718.3 million in the same
period a year earlier.

Oversupply to prompt mergers
The company said it expected oversupply would continue to weaken prices in the seaborne coal
market in the coming year and could result in mergers in the global coal industry.

"Current pricing versus cost of production challenges are expected to drive further consolidation within
the market, specifically among smaller operators, in the year ahead, and may provide some new
marketing opportunities as Yancoal continues to maximize its existing blending strategies," the
company said in the report.

Yancoal said its priorities for fiscal 2014-15 were to progress the expansion of its flagship Moolarben
thermal coal mine, as well as its Stratford and Ashton mines in New South Wales.
Yancoal's 78% shareholder, Chinese miner Yanzhou Coal, scrapped plans in March to acquire the
remaining 22% of shares it did not already own.
