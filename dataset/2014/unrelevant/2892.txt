Moody's Investors Service says that Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. Ltd's letter of debt support to Yancoal
Australia Ltd (unrated) , if approved by shareholders, is credit negative but has no immediate impact on
Yanzhou Coal's Ba2 corporate family rating and negative outlook.
On 9th November, Yanzhou Coal announced its proposal to subscribe to around USD1.8 billion of
convertible hybrid bonds to be issued by its 78%-owned subsidiary, Yancoal Australia. Yancoal Australia
plans to issue a total amount of USD2.3 billion under its proposed rights offer, with the remaining
USD507 million to be offered to its minority shareholders -- Noble Group (Baa3 stable) (13.2%) and
public shareholders (8.8%).

"If Noble and other shareholder's subscribe to the convertible bonds, it will boost Yancoal Australia's
liquidity but also modestly increase Yanzhou Coal's gross debt leverage," says Simon Wong, a Moody's
Vice President and Senior Credit Officer/Manager.
Yancoal Australia plans to use the proceeds of the convertible bonds to repay its USD1.8 billion
shareholder loan to Yanzhou Coal. It will use the remaining proceeds to fund its existing operations and
future growth.

"The proposed letter of debt support to Yancoal Australia is credit negative, as it could substantially
reduce Yanzhou Coal's liquidity. However, its rating and the negative outlook already incorporate the
possibility of such financial support," adds Wong.
Yanzhou Coal also proposed to provide a 10 year debt facility of up to AUD1.4 billion (about USD1.2
billion) to Yancoal Australia for the purpose of general corporate funding. Under the letter of debt
support, Yanzhou Coal also proposes to provide additional financial support to fund the interest on the
convertible hybrid bonds over a five-year period up to an amount of AUD807 million (about USD694
million).
As of end-September Yanzhou Coal's had a cash balance of USD4 billion, including term deposits. Its
cash balance would be reduced substantially if the facilities are fully drawn.
The subscription and letter of debt support are subject to approval from Yanzhou Coal's shareholders at
the next extraordinary general meeting of shareholders. The subscription letter and the letter of support
will be dispatched to the shareholders on or before 26 November 2014.

The negative outlook continues to reflect the ongoing operating losses and financial risks from Yanzhou
Coal's ongoing expansion in Australia. Resolution of the weak credit metrics of Yancoal Australia has
been hampered by the slow pace of ramp-up in production, due to soft demand and weak coal prices.
Downward rating pressure could emerge if Yanzhou Coal (1) fails to reduce its debt leverage; (2) fails to
turn around its Australian operations; (3) experiences a material disruption in its operations due to
non-compliance with mining regulations; or (4) experiences persistent negative free cash flows and its
liquidity weakens.

Indicators for downward rating pressure include its cash balance falling below 5% of total assets; adjusted
net debt/EBITDA continuously exceeding 5.5x; or EBIT/ interest below 2.0x.

50%, this could also be negative for Yanzhou Coal's ratings.
The principal methodology used in this rating was Global Mining Industry published in August 2014.
