0102 GMT [Dow Jones] Some Chinese media reported late Monday that the People's Bank of China
has ordered major banks to loosen mortgage policies, and the market may interpret this as another
pre-emptive move by the central government to prevent the housing market from further decline. Banks
are reportedly looking into allowing more people to qualify as first-time home buyers, thereby enjoying
lower down payment requirements, according to a report from the 21st Century Business Herald. Banks
are now considering allowing home buyers who purchase their second homes to be considered first time
home buyers as long as the previous mortgage loan is fully paid. "The actual impact of this rule change is
uncertain, as historically many second home purchases were treated as first homes," says Credit Suisse
analyst Jinsong Du. This could raise hope that there may be more central government support if the
housing market does not recover. (esther.fung@wsj.com)

0053 GMT [Dow Jones] Activity levels on Australia's main securities exchange have been softer in the
early part of fiscal 2015 despite the continued surge in raised capital, ASX (ASX.AU) CEO Elmer Funke
Kupper says. Low and stable domestic interest rates as well as low levels of market volatility have kept
activity levels subdued, he tells the bourse's annual general meeting. Still, he says A$10.1 billion has
been raised in the first two months of the fiscal year, up 11% on last year, with 23 IPOs compared with
12 a year ago. Total cash market average daily value traded was A$3.9 billion, in line with last year, he
adds. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

0052 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian equities are down for a second day running as worries over the pace
of economic growth in China, the country's biggest trading partner, weigh on the currency and prices for
iron ore and other commodities. The S&P/ASX 200 is down 0.3% at 5347.1 in early trading, with the
materials subindex 1.1% lower. Iron-ore producers continue their fall after the steelmaking ingredient fell
to a fresh five-year low below US$80/ton, with BHP Billiton (BHP.AU) down 1.7%, Rio Tinto (RIO.AU)
1.2% lower and Fortescue (FMG.AU) off 2.2%. The big banks also are adding to the previous day's fall,
with Westpac Banking (WBC.AU) 0.7% lower and Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AU) off 0.2%. Market
focus is on today's HSBC Flash Manufacturing PMI for China, with ANZ Bank forecasting a decline to
49.8 in September, which would mark a return to contraction territory for the first time since May.

0051 GMT [Dow Jones] The Reserve Bank of Australia's wish to achieve a weaker local currency to
assist economic recovery is becoming more of a reality with the Australian dollar breaking below
US$0.8900 overnight, says Tom Williams, senior currency strategist at GoMarkets. Commodity markets
began to slide following comments from China's finance minister which suggested that his government

0048 GMT [Dow Jones] The New Zealand dollar slipped to a three-day low of 88.09 against the yen
Tuesday, extending Monday's retreat from a two-month high of 89.03, as concerns over China's
economy crimped investors' risk appetite. The Kiwi's fall came ahead of the release of the HSBC flash
China September manufacturing PMI data due at 0145 GMT. Many analysts expect the PMI to fall below
50, signaling contraction. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the NZD/JPY daily price chart is tilting
negative as a bearish outside-day-range pattern was completed Monday, and the slow stochastic
measure has turned bearish at overbought levels. Further downside in the NZD/JPY cross may
encounter support at the 55-day moving average, now at 0.8751 and roughly coinciding with the uptrend
line that runs from the Aug. 8 swing low of 85.71. Spot NZD/JPY is at 88.11 versus 88.37 late Monday.

0036 GMT [Dow Jones] Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota is full of suggestions for how
to enhance the central bank's communications, which have become increasingly important to monetary
policy with official interest rates at effectively zero since December 2008. One way to be more
transparent, he says, would be "to describe more clearly how the mandated goals of maximum
employment and price stability are linked with financial stability considerations." Does this mean a three
dimensional dot plot is on the way? (pedro.dacosta@wsj.com)

2359 GMT [Dow Jones] Front-month Nymex November crude is likely to trade with risks skewed to the
downside near-term after settling down 78 cents Monday at $90.87/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis
shows. The daily continuation chart is tilting negative as the slow stochastic measure is bearish, the
positive MACD histogram bars are contracting, while the five and 15-day moving averages are falling.
Support is at $90.41 (Monday's low); a breach would target $90.11 (May 1, 2013 reaction low), then the
psychological $90.00 line, $87.55 (April 22, 2013 low) and $85.61 (April 18, 2013 swing low). But a rise
above $91.92 (Monday's high) would temper the negative near-term view, exposing the upside to $93.22
(Friday's high), then to the middle 20-day Bollinger Band (now at $93.34), $94.82 (Thursday's high),
$95.06 (Wednesday's high) and $95.19 (Sept. 16 reaction high). November crude is up 12 cents at
$90.99/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2355 GMT [Dow Jones] New Zealand's rural sentiment is at its lowest level since September 2012, with
37% of farmers having a negative outlook of the rural economy in the next 12 months, compared with
24% with that view in the previous survey, according to the latest quarterly Rabobank Rural Confidence
Survey. "Falling dairy commodity prices are the overwhelming factor at play here. At the time of the
survey being taken, the global DairyTrade auction prices fell 6%, taking them down 45% from their
February peak," says Rabobank New Zealand CEO Ben Russell. The latest survey found almost half of
dairy farmers surveyed--47%--expect the performance of their own farm business to worsen in the
coming 12 months, up from 30% in the previous quarter. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter:

7:29 pm ET [Dow Jones] If Allergan (AGN) lands Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) it would make it harder
for Valeant (VRX) to buy AGN. But expect more fireworks. For one, bet Bill Ackman would likely keep
fighting AGN's board of directors and attempt to remove a majority at December meeting. Plus,
Ackman's lawyers have hinted in open court they may sue to stop any alternative AGN deal, or a delay to
allow a vote. A majority of shareholders at Darden sought a vote on DRI's sale of Red Lobster and when
DRI ignored, activist launched fight for entire board and sale had enflamed tensions.

2237 GMT [Dow Jones]--A cloud has cleared over Bank of Queensland (BOQ.AU) after the bank settled
proceedings brought against it by the securities regulator and a class action on behalf of borrowers
advised by Storm Financial, J.P. Morgan says. It notes it follows similar moves by BOQ's peers in late
2012 and early 2013. The brokerage views the roughly A$22.1 million from the settlement as immaterial
from a capital perspective, and the bank has said it won't have a bearing on its fiscal 2014 final dividend.

traded at A$12.06. (robb.stewart@wsj.com)

18:27 EDT - With the long-end of the Australian bond market on track for its worst month since June
2013, JPMorgan remains underweight bond-sensitive sectors of the equity market including telecoms,
utilities and real estate investment trusts, says Paul Brunker, Australian equity strategist. "The latter may
also be unsettled by the recent volatility of the Aussie dollar," he says, adding trusts may additionally
have less support from retail investors thanks to a lack of franking credits. (robb.stewart@wsj.com;

17:48 EDT - Mexico's antitrust authority hopes to be closely involved with the development of the new
airport hub in Mexico City, says Alejandra Palacios, head of the country's competition commission.
Depending on how the slots and fuel are sold, the new airport could make Mexican air travel more
competitive, she says. Mexico's current air hub, the Benito Juarez airport, is operating near full capacity,
pushing up the cost of airfare. The new facility is expected to cost at least $9.2B and take several years
to build. (amy.guthrie@wsj.com)
