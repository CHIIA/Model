OVERSEAS INVESTORS LIKELY TO HAVE PLAYED THEIR PART

Our market closed barely lower - or in the positive if the ex div effect of three major banks today is
excluded - with the budget by and larger well regarded by the business community but with mixed feelings
at best by private citizens. Offshore buying is likely to have played a part, given the strong rise in the
dollar.

"Ceiling will be 5520, floor will be 5460. Close at 5483, down 15.2 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "the Sextant Report" said, "Our market looks set to open relatively flat with
the local futures contract up 1 point.

"Index leadership was bearish again overnight in the US with both the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000
closing lower.

The latter was down more than one percent. US regional banks also essentially erased the prior days
gains. These bearish tells are consistent with moderate downside risk over the next one to two weeks.

"In terms of our market, I have no idea how it will respond to the budget. From a technical viewpoint
however, yesterdays move should see us likely exceed yesterday's highs before pulling back.

"The ceiling will be 5520. The floor will be 5460. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5483, down 15.2 points'.
