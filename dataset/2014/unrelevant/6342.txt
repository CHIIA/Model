Leigh Seymour, the daughter of Brisbane property baron Kevin Seymour, has sold a Melbourne car
park to a private Chinese investor for a record $40 million.
Ms Seymour acquired the nine-level strata title property at 300 Flinders Street for $28.2 million in
November 2011. Since then, the facility has been reworked under the Seymours' hand. Returns
have increased as the owner replaced the operator, improved the property and signed Secure
Parking on a 10-year lease.

"This is an excellent return on equity. It must rank alongside some of the best property
transactions in the past couple of years," Ms Seymour said.
The sale sets a new price per bay of $69,700, well above the current per-bay rate in Melbourne of
around $50,000.
At that price, the transaction brokered by Savills agents Clinton Baxter and Nick Peden represents
a sharp 6.07 per cent yield.
"Melbourne's [central business district] car park market is an exceptionally tightly held and lucrative
market sector, one that is protected by planning policies aimed at minimising the construction of
additional car bays within the central CBD," Mr Baxter said.

"Car parks are very appealing to local and offshore investors alike because of the relative ease of
management of the asset."
The 574-space above-ground car park sits within Victoria University's city campus building.
The university campus component, also on strata title, was sold to Singapore-based hospitality
player Hotel Grand Central for $48.5 million last year.Car parking jewel

Ms Seymour has become an active investor. Late last year she reclaimed the family's Brisbane
car-parking jewel, the McWhirters car park in the Fortitude Valley, for about $40 million.
For Ms Seymour, the Melbourne car park's development potential was limited by its position as a
strata property within a larger building.
The transaction now allows Ms Seymour to focus on her ambition to redevelop the larger
McWhirters car park. She plans to develop a 20-storey extension above the existing facility, offering
35,000 square metres of office space.
"Fortitude Valley is a growing area. We can add significant value to the site," she said.
The Seymour family also owns the Festival Hall car park in Brisbane and last year made an
unsuccessful attempt to buy the Sydney Opera House car park.

$39.75 million.
With wealth estimated at $580 million by BRW, the family also has a stake in listed company
Ariadne, which owns car parks in joint venture with Secure Parking.

"We've been in car parks since 1972," Kevin Seymour said last year. "We've made a lot of money
out of parking over the past 40 years. They are a great asset class for us. There's no maintenance
or supervision or repairs. It's just a good, solid asset class, which is trouble-free."
