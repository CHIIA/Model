The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close mildly higher today.

Markets rose in Europe, the UK and US last night.

On the NYSE where 3222 issues traded there were 2,466 issues higher ,650 down and 106 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2717 issues traded there were 1,878 issues higher, 760 down and 79 unchanged.
Metals were higher, crude was up a touch, gold was steady. The $A is at 93.76US c, about in line with
last evening.

"Support is now at 5390, next level of resistance 5435 .. I'll call us up 15"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "Nasdaq closed right on its highs last night which is
very encouraging. It has broken through the resistance level at 4055. It is still in downtrend from its high
back on the 7th of March, but if it can break back and close above 4135 over the coming week it's
potentially going to be short term neutral. Its good to see the 4000 level hold after being tested for the last
3 days.
"Copper looks like it was potentially a false break yesterday but we need to see it above $3.05/lb and
finish there for the week. Support is at $3, resistance is at $3.05.
*Gold entered a short term uptrend this week but yesterday's move and last night's move confirmed a
break down. It has broken through the 20 day moving average and is technically heading back towards the
previous support of $1280, then $1250.

*The S&P 500 closed on its highs, breaking back above the 1860 level which was resistance, and also
where the 20 day moving average was sitting with a strong close. It is back in the range where it was all
through late February and March. The picture there is neutral at the moment. Any break out through 1875
and we will see 1890 tested again.

*Our market had a very strong day yesterday, closing pretty much on its highs.

We also broke back above the 20 day moving average and are not far from resistance at 5424. The next
strong test is 5450. We are also back in the uptrend channel.

"If the US can hold we look to test the next level of 5435, then 5450 and can head back to 5500 if 5450 is
broken. Support is now at 5390.

"For the day given we had a strong day yesterday, some of last night's overseas move has been factored
in. I'll call us up 15 points'. .

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 32.1 points to 5420.3 last evening.

April 17. Good morning.

Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rates at exceptionally low levels for a considerable time. She said
economic growth had slowed over the winter, but that a significant part of the weakness was due to
unusually cold winter weather.

*In the Ukraine, the attempt to take back eastern towns from pro-Russian militants appeared to stall on
Wednesday.

In Donetsk, six armored vehicles sent into the nearby city of Kramatorsk in the morning later showed up
carrying Russian flags in Slaviansk, peacefully surrendering to pro-Russian forces.

Ukraine, the EU, US and Russia are meeting to discuss a political solution today (European time).

EU sets 80% reduction target for use of plastic bags by 2019

Last night Euro MPs voted in favour of strict new targets to reduce plastic bag use.

In the UK a supermarket plastic bag charge will be introduced in 2015.

Every nation in Europe will have to bring in tough new measures to slash the use of plastic bags, after a
key EU vote yesterday.

The decision is a huge boost for conservationists, who have been fighting for years to reduce the huge
volumes of devastating plastic litter harming the environment.

The EU directive, which will pass into law in the coming weeks, also removes blocks to outright bans on
plastic bags for the first time.
Sue Kinsey of the Marine Conservation Society said: 'This is a fantastic result and will lead to the drastic
reduction of single use carrier bags given out throughout Europe.' An estimated 100 billion carrier bags
are used every year in Europe - with 8 billion ending up as litter.
Many of those end up in seas and rivers, killing millions of marine animals.
