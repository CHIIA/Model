On the same day Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying signed a £4 million (HK$50 million) deal as part of
his former company’s £77.5 million sale to listed Australian engineering firm UGL, a second offer
arrived to buy the company that exceeded UGL’s bid by about £90 million.
The sudden sale of Leung’s former company DTZ to UGL shocked British investors, Stephen
Webster, shareholder and ex-director of DTZ, told the South China Morning Post.

“As shareholders, we felt there were a number of other options that should have been considered but
obviously were not,” said Webster, who left DTZ in 2009, two years before UGL’s acquisition of the
firm.
Webster told the Post yesterday that the DTZ board and its administrator at the time, Ernst & Young,
should have explored a management buyout, corporate restructure, or a sale to a higher bidder. The
revelation of the second bid – purportedly from China – is likely to raise questions about Leung’s
conduct in 2011 during his final days as a DTZ director, and in particular, whether he gave impartial
advice on the merits of the second offer, given that he stood to gain HK$50 million if the UGL sale
went through.

UGL eventually bought London-listed DTZ for £77.5 million in a deal that wiped out both shareholders
and unsecured creditors, and required British-taxpayer-backed bank RBS to take a 30 per cent loss
on a £110 million loan to the troubled real estate consultancy.
Leung has faced fresh calls to resign from his role as Hong Kong’s leader since Fairfax Media last
week revealed the secret HK$50 million deal between him and UGL, which included an additional
agreement for him to serve as an adviser to UGL “from time to time”.

Leung has said this was a resignation arrangement for him and a standard business practice of
non-competition deals. But politicians and some lawyers have said he should not have agreed to
provide paid service to a commercial entity while serving as the city’s chief executive.

According to an Ernst & Young report, now filed at Companies House in London, a “confidential
bidder” had on December 2 offered to inject £48.8 million in new equity into DTZ, and to refinance
existing loans in exchange for a 50.1 per cent stake in the firm. The deal was valued at 18 pence per
share.
As a board member and chairman of DTZ’s lucrative Asia-Pacific operations, Leung held 8.6 million
shares in April 2011, according to DTZ’s annual report, valuing his stake at £1.54 million if the second
offer was successful.

Leung would not say if he welcomed the new suitor. In an email response to the Post, Leung’s office
said “the decision to sell DTZ was a decision made by DTZ board of directors”.

decided there was “insufficient time” given DTZ’s “cash flow position” and “lack of further funding”
from RBS.
The bidder was reported in the Chinese press to be Tianjin Innovation Financial Investment
Company, although the Post has been unable to reach it for confirmation. The firm is a Chinese
state-owned enterprise set up in 2008 to take charge of the planning and development of a new
financial district in Tianjin city, according to the company’s website.
A 2012 report by mainland newspaper China Business News quoted a source as saying the firm
“was unfairly treated” and that it could not remit money overseas at the time because of the mainland
policy of foreign exchange control.
On November 24, 2011, Leung announced his resignation from DTZ’s board to stand as a candidate
in Hong Kong’s chief executive election. His resignation took effect on December 4.

On December 2, Leung signed an agreement with UGL stipulating that he would receive £4 million in
two instalments in 2012 and last year should the UGL bid prove successful. UGL and Leung said the
money was to prevent him from forming or joining a rival firm within two years.

The city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Australian Federal Police are
evaluating the need to investigate the matter after receiving complaints from politicians.

Local lawmaker Kenneth Leung, who filed a complaint with Britain’s Listing Authority asking it to check
if DTZ and Leung had complied with listing and corporate directorship rules, said it “went against
common sense” that DTZ would pass up the rival bid, which offered more money and a “better future”
for its employees.
