TOURISM Australia is targeting China’s most affluent travel seekers with a holiday that “money
can’t buy”.

Well, it can, but it’ll set you back $70,000 per person.

The 22-day tour takes in every state and territory, showcasing Uluru, Gold Coast beaches and
Kangaroo Island plus top restaurants such as Quay in Sydney, Darwin’s Evoo and Attica in
Melbourne.
International business class flights, luxury lodgings and exclusive wine tastings are also included
in the price.
China is now Australia’s most valuable tourism market, overtaking the UK last year, to be worth
$5.3 billion.
That figure is expected to grow to $13 billion by 2020.
Although just 30 packages will be sold to underline its exclusivity, Tourism Australia managing
director John O’Sullivan said it was about “making headlines”. “What we’re really seeking to do is
create a buzz, a sense of excitement,” he said.
