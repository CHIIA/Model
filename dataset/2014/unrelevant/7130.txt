Indicative bids for the NSW Government's Delta Coastal plants were submitted this week with at
least four potential acquirers set to be sent through to the next round.

Japan's Marubeni and ASX-listed ERM Power, the under-bidders for Macquarie Generation , which
was bought by AGL Energy for $1.5 billion last month, are believed to involved in the process.

It is understood Origin Energy and a Chinese company, thought to be Shenhua Energy, have
also lobbed in a first-round offer.

The government hopes to sell Delta Coastal, which includes the Vales Point and Colongra
generators, for up to $800 million.

While Delta produces a fraction of MacGen's supply, the plants, located on NSW's central coast,
are often tapped into when the state's electricity supply becomes stretched.
In the MacGen sale process, the main under-bidder to AGL, ERM Power, was ruled out as an
acquirer by the then NSW Treasurer Mike Baird, who said its offer was too low.
Meanwhile, Lumo Energy's auction has attracted interest from renewable firmPacific Hydro and
private equity-owned Alinta Energy as well as Origin Energy , Snowy Hydro's Red Energy, and
M2 Telecommunications .

Up to half a dozen prospective buyers will attend management presentations and site visits in
Melbourne through July and August with owner Infratil Energy hoping to close out a deal by the
end of September.
Lumo, which analysts have valued at between $420 million and $570 million, is making about
$60 million this year with a significant uptick expected in earnings over the next two to three years.
