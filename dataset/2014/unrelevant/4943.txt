Markets were sharply weaker in Europe and the UK partly on Crimea concerns, partly on the small solar
power company in China being allowed to default, with metals worried on South Africa's having passed
amendments to its Minerals & Mining Act.

US markets closed mixed.

On the NYSE where 3208 issues traded there were 1,331 issues higher, 1,796 down and 81 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2705 issues traded there were 1,277 issues higher , 1,325 down and 103 unchanged.
Metals were sharply lower, crude rose, gold weakened. The $A is at 90.66US c, down 20 points from last
evening.

*Commodities and share markets in Europe were weaker across the board as investors and speculators
alike went for cash instead, media reports commented.

*Standoff in the Ukraine

Russia has said if Crimea wanted to join the 83 Subjects (States) under its rule it would be very welcome.
It had been separated out of Russia in 1954. Ukraine has ruled the referendum for March 16 is illegal.
*Russia has said Ukraine must pay off almost $2 billion owed for natural gas today, or supplies may be
cut. The last time Russia cut oil supplies to Ukraine was in 2009 which caused considerable hardship in
Europe since the pipelines go through the Ukraine.

Meanwhile the paralympic games have opened in great style in Sochi, with Ukrainians and Russians also
competing.

*Alarm bells ring on South Africa's amended minerals law - more below.

March 8. Good morning.

*While a search of the South African government websites has not so far yielded information on the latest
changes on the Mining Law, the Financial Times in London reports that on Friday South Africa approved
amendments to its Mineral Development Act which gives far reaching implications to petroleum and coal
miners in South Africa (more below in Other News).
*The Financial Times commented, "Anglo American currently sells thermal coal for just $17 a tonne in
South Africa against $74 to export markets and iron ore for $62 a tonne against $115 internationally".

*Our note: apart from highly negative implications for Australian companies in South Africa, should the
new laws be enforced at their ultimate levels, China companies with operations there could be affected.

Overseas eco news

In US eco news, 175,000 new jobs were added in February vs 151,000 new jobs expected and vs
129,000 new jobs in January.

*The unemployment rate, obtained separately from a survey of households, rose to 6.7% from 6.6%, said
to relate mostly to bad weather.

*Hourly earnings rose 9c or 0.4% on average to 424.31 last month, the biggest gain since last June.
*Consumer borrowing in the US rose $13.7 billion in January following a revised 415.9 billion rise in
December, smaller than initially reported, the Fed Reserve reported. Credit card purchases fell by $225.6
million in January after a $3.1 billion gain a month earlier.
Non revolving credit rose by $13.9 billion after rising $12.8 billion the month before.

*US gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualised rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013, down
from an initial estimate of 3.2%, the Commerce Department reported.

The revision is down to weaker than expected consumer spending.

Severe winter weather in the US is expected to slow growth further in the current quarter.

The Commerce Department initially predicted consumer spending had expanded by 3.3%, but spending
is now estimated to have grown at a 2.6% annual rate.

Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US economic activity.

Bad winter weather has cut into vehicle sales, among other purchases.

Despite the revised GDP estimate, US growth should be regarded as strong, the financial information
firm Markit said.

"The details of the report suggest that investment is growing at an increased rate and underlying demand
continued to expand at a reassuringly robust rate, given the headwinds during the closing months of
2013," said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson.

For all of 2013, the economy grew at 1.9%.
The US trade deficit widened to $39.1 billion in January from a revised $39 billion in December, the
Commerce Department reported.

*In Europe, German Industrial Production rose 0.8% in January after a 0.1% rise in December, revised up
from a 0.6% fall reported earlier.

*In Ireland industrial production rose 0.9% in January from December after a 2.2% fall in December.

"Mineweb" in Johannesburg last night carried the following report,

Author: Ayanda Mdluli

Posted: Friday , 07 Mar 2014
" According to Lizel Oberholzer, director and head of oil and gas at pan-African corporate law firm
Bowman Gilfillan, “Some of the most significant changes to the Bill were rushed through this week,
including provisions for state participation in petroleum licences,” she said in a statement.

Oberholzer noted that earlier versions of the Bill entitled the State to a free carried interest of 20% and a
further participation interest of 30% with the total state interest capped at 50%.

“The version that was approved yesterday removed the reference to a 30% participation interest as well
as the limit of 50%, effectively giving the State the right to take over an existing petroleum operation,” she
explained.

While previously the State was obligated to pay “a fair market value” for any participation interest that it
acquired, it now only needs to pay “an agreed price” which would present major problems in the future as
the Bill does not make any provision for a situation where price cannot be agreed upon”.

The Bill also introduces the notion of ‘production sharing agreements’, a system employed in other
countries with mature upstream industries. However, South Africa currently implements a tax royalty
system in the minerals and petroleum sector and it is unclear how this system will be combined with a
production sharing regime,” she said.

James Lorimer, shadow minister for mineral resources at the Democratic Alliance (The country's official
opposition in government) referred to the bill as a 'crony enrichment bill', because of the power to
designate mining licence beneficiaries it will provide the Minister.
Also, the state will be entitled to take over 100% of oil and gas companies, 20% for free and the other
80% at a forced, 'fire sale' price; which will allow the Minister to rule the sector by making regulations
which can easily be changed at short notice, he said (our italics)

Page196of270©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has used its majority muscle to override any opposition to
amendments of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, effectively opening the door for
the nationalisation of the oil and gas sector.
The act will effectively govern South Africa’s entire mineral resources sector, including the nascent oil
and gas sector that aims to explore for and extract shale gas in the Karoo.

On Thursday, Parliament’s mineral resources committee finalised its clause-by-clause deliberations on
the bill in a meeting characterised by sniping between ANC and Democratic Alliance MPs.

The votes on contested clauses were always eight to two in the ANC’s favour.

The most contentious of the clauses was introduced by the ANC on Wednesday evening and concerned
the state’s participation in oil and gas production.

While the DA bitterly opposed the changes, saying they would smother investment in the sector, the ANC
overrode its concerns by claiming that the changes were based on the ideology of those who voted for
them.

The two clauses fall under section 86 of the draft law.

The first clause gives the state, through a designated organ of state, the right to a 20% free carried
interest on all new exploration and production rights of oil and gas.

The second clause now says that in addition to the free carry interest, the state is "entitled" to a further
participation of up to 80%.
Currently the clause imposes a ceiling on the state for an additional acquisition of 30% of the venture.
The oil and gas sector has opposed strongly the proposed free carry interest and the 30% ceiling. A
number of oil and gas sector company representatives left Thursday’s meeting in a sullen mood and
refused to comment, only indicating they would prepare a statement on the matter.
Webber Wentzel law firm partner Peter Leon said that while the bill had been improved considerably,
especially in terms of the beneficiation issue, he found the oil and gas provisions troubling.

"Those provisions are clearly undesirable and will have a negative effect on the sector," he said.

On Friday, the committee will finalise its report on the bill for the National Assembly and it may be
debated next week, which will be the last parliamentary session ahead of the May 7 national and
provincial elections.
