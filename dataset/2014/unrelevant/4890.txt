Our market was buffetted by profit downgrades from Kathmandu and Sims Metals while the takeover of
Country Road had little impact apart from being very good news for Solly Lew with his lucrative trading
ploy - and a handful of remaining Country Road shareholders.

*An observation!

Gerald Stanley, a Fibonacci chartist says that interestingly, over the last five trading days the market has
traded in copybook fashion re. Fibonacci theory.

After the astonishing 85.5 point rise on Thursday June 19, the market fell 61% last Friday or 52.8 points
(perfect score would have been down 48.7 points) rose 32.7 points or 61% yesterday (perfect score would
have been up 33.8 points) and closed down 61% or 20.2 points today (perfect score would have been
20.5 points).

His conclusion: Nothing is really happening on the market.

(i.e. books have closed for the year, as "Bernborough" says.).

"I'll call us up marginally, about 7 points'

"Bernborough" said, "I expect the market to trade quietly, I'll call us up marginally, about 7 points.
Everyone's very happy to hold the market together where it is, they are happy with bonuses etc and are
happy to keep it bubbling slightly higher. Most instos have ruled off their books.

"We'll start afresh next week".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 33.8 points to 5453.3 last evening.

The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index reveals consumer confidence has improved a further
2.4 per cent over the past week, bringing the total improvement in confidence to 6 per cent over the past
four weeks, and staving off the risk of "contagion" into business confidence.

But consumer confidence still remains 10 per cent lower than at the end of April, when the federal budget
and the findings of the federal government's commission of audit findings were released.

The May consumer confidence reading of 105.7 points is still below the long term monthly average (based
on readings since 1990) of 113.7 points.

US EPA wins most of its greenhouse gas curb plans in U.S. Supreme Court ruling

Reuters reports on Monday the US Supreme Court on a 7-2 vote, the court rejected an industry-backed
argument that most emitting facilities should not be regulated for greenhouse gases under one particular
air pollution program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

But industry could claim a partial win because the court ruled on a 5-4 vote that some facilities the
government had wanted to regulate will be exempted. Some landfills, pulp and paper facilities, electronics
manufacturing plants, chemical production plants and beverage producers are among the small industrial
sources likely to be exempted, an EPA spokesman said.
Energy efficiency, waste mgt, transport could add $2.6 tr a year to global GDP

Page51of295©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.A report by the World Bank with philanthropic group ClimateWorks Foundaton has found the benefits of
policies to cut emissions from transport, industrial and building sectors as well as from waste and cooking
fuels in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the US, China and the EU could see global output rise $2.6 trillion a
year, or 2.2 percent, by 2030, Reuters reported.
*It found a shift to low-carbon transport and improved energy efficiency in factories, buildings and
appliances could increase global growth in gross domestic product (GDP) by an extra $1.8 trillion, or 1.5
percent, a year by 2030.

*If financing and technology investment increased, global GDP could grow by an additional $2.6 trillion, or
2.2 percent, a year by 2030, the World Bank said.

*Climate policies could also avert at least 94,000 premature deaths a year from pollution-related diseases
by 2030, improve crop productivity and prevent around 8.5 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases being
emitted - the same as taking around 2 billion cars off the road.
*For example, if China deployed 70 million low-carbon cook stoves, it could avoid around 1 million
premature deaths from pollution and reap almost $11 billion in economic benefits, the report showed.

To speed up action on climate change, United Nations' Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has invited heads
of state, governments, businesses and civil society to a climate summit on September 23 in New York.
