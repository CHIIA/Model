South Korean steelmaker Posco said its status in the $7 billion West Pilbara iron ore project would be
unaffected by China's Baosteel acquiring Aquila Resources, which owns 50% of the Western Australia
project. "Our official stance is that even if there is a stake change in ownership it will have no effect on
our role in the project," a Seoul-based Posco spokesman said.
Posco owns 49% of AMCI, which holds the 50% balance of West Pilbara, giving the Korean company a
near 25% stake in the project. In early May, Shanghai-based Baosteel – in conjunction with Queensland
freight haulage company Aurizon – tabled a $1.3 billion takeover bid for Aquila, which the Perth-based
junior miner is still mulling.

The Posco spokesman said the steelmaker had "no intention" of changing its status in the project, which
entitles it to up to 10 million mt/year of iron ore offtake when production eventually starts. "But if you
ask the same question of Baosteel and the other companies they may give you another perspective," he
said.

AMCI was unavailable for comment and Aquila is not commenting on the proposed takeover from
Baosteel and Aurizon.
Posco paid $162 million for half of AMCI in 2010, and has repeatedly said its intention is to become
50% self-sufficient in iron ore within the next few years. It also owns 12.5% of the Roy Hilliron ore
project in Western Australia which is likely to begin producing in late 2015 or early 2016.
Baosteel currently owns 20% of Aquila but if it is successful in its bid to acquire all of the company it
would in principle be entitled to half the proposed 30 million mt/year of iron ore that West Pilbara could
eventually produce. The project has been mothballed over the past 18 months or so as Aquila and AMCI
have been unable to agree on a development budget.

Perth-based Morgans analyst James Wilson said the deal under its current structure of A$3.40 ($3.20)
per Aquila share would be a good one for Baosteel, as "even at a 30% premium they're really buying
these tons quite cheap given how much has already been spent [on the project]."
