Developers Mirvac, Leighton Properties and Urban Growth are proposing a 28-storey tower in the
shape of an ellipse, as part of a $150 million residential project at the heart of Sydney's Green
Square.

Operating under the name The Green Square Consortium, the developers on Monday revealed
plans for two towers with 310 apartments, to book-end a bustling public plaza with shops, cafes
and a sunken library.

Plans submitted to the City of Sydney Council seek approval for a 28-storey tower in the shape of
an ellipse, with 246 apartments. Next door, the group plans a 10-storey mixed-use building with 64
apartments.

Designed by FJMT Architecture from a short list of five, both buildings have ground-floor retail
spaces.

There will be two basement levels underground, with 180 car parks and 370 bicycle spaces.
Located on a former council depot site on the corner of Bourke Street and Dunning Avenue, the
site represents one of the first developments in the 13.47 hectare Green Square Town Centre
urban renewal precinct.
The Town Centre sits next to Green Square railway station, and will form the residential and retail
centre of the larger 287 Green Square area.

An idea first raised in 1995, the Town Centre will house more than 6800 residents and 8600
workers, in addition to an aquatic centre and a sports park.

The Green Square Consortium will develop 40 per cent of the land in the Town Centre precinct,
while other developers – including Meriton, Crown Group, Lateral Corporation and China-backed
group Bridgehill Projects – will also embark on developments.
Meriton could build as many as 250 apartments at 84-92 Epsom Road, a site it purchased for
$47.5 million March.

The plans of other developers are more advanced.
Private developer Crown is awaiting approval on a 346-apartment development at the John Newell
site, which neighbour's the Green Square Consortium's Bourke Street lot.
Designed by architect Koichi Takada, the apartment building will also have 5000 square metres of
retail space and 311 car spaces.

Bridgehill Projects and Lateral Corporation are also in planning.

including roads and drainage, in addition to innovative features including a stormwater recycling
plant.
