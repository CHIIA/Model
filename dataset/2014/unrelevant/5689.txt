Sydney - Tuesday - October 28: (RWE Australian Business News) - World precious metals against spot
sellng prices on Asian markets.
Precious metals were firmer this after gold ends slightly lower; focus turns to FOMC, reports Kitco news.

In Asia, gold rose $3.70 to $1220.80 oz, while silver added 3c to $17.24 oz and platinum gained $2.00 to
$12591 oz while palladium improved $1.00 to $788.00 oz

Asian stocks fell, with the regional index retreating from a two-week high before the Federal Reserve
meets on whether to end its bond-buying program. The dollar held losses versus major peers while crude
oil extended its drop.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.2 percent by 9:53 a.m. in Tokyo, falling from its highest close since
Oct. 9 as Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.5 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were
little changed after the gauge’s 0.2 percent decline.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was steady after dropping 0.2 percent yesterday amid losses against
the euro and yen. Australian 10-year bonds climbed. Oil in New York and London fell for a third day
before a U.S. supplies report.
China posts industrial-company profit data today, while in the U.S., durable goods and consumer
confidence figures are due, with Fed officials on track to announce the end of the bank’s stimulatory
asset purchases tomorrow.
The Bank of Japan may moderate its language on inflation in a report this week amid the slump in oil
prices, said people familiar with the deliberations, asking not to be named as the talks were private.

By contrast global metal prices quoted in New York and London at week's end were:

COMMODITIES ...Commodities slumped to a five-year low led by gasoline and agriculture products
grown in Brazil on speculation a slump in the country’s currency will fuel exports. The Bloomberg
Commodity Index dropped 0.6 percent at 1:56 p.m. in London after falling to the lowest since July 2009.
Raw sugar futures fell 1.6 percent and soybeans dropped 0.4 percent. Brazil is the biggest exporter of
both commodities.

COMEX METALS... spot gold is presently $1,1228.59 oz. The Oct futures contract fell $2.50 to
$1,229.10 oz. Dec contract lost $2.50 to $1229.30 oz, Dec silver eased $0.02 to $17.161 oz. Oct
platinum regained $3.80 to $1255.20 oz while Dec copper rose $2.30 to 306.30c lb in NY.

ANZ COMMODITIES ...(Oct28) Bulk markets were mixed. Iron ore prices fell 1.2% to USD79.50/tonne,
despite Chinese January 2015 rebar futures firming over 1%. Southern hemisphere thermal coal prices

plants have increased purchases on cooler weather in northern China and the risk that domestic
producers will raise prices. Policy to curb China’s domestic coal supply may lead to shortages ahead of
year end, with some expecting November prices to rise by as much as USD4.90/tonne.
Metal markets were also mixed, with copper and aluminium the two key markets to rise. Copper prices
were supported by news of planned strike action in Peru’s largest copper mine and rumours China’s
State Reserve Board has resumed buying copper. Workers at Peru’s Antamina plan to strike indefinitely
from 10th November, halting total output of around 30,000 tonnes per month.

Agricultural markets were mixed, with sugar lower but corn and soybean prices higher. A weaker
Brazilian real is dragging sugar prices lower. Soybean prices are up by 6% in the last week as dry
weather and the optimal planting time in Brazil’s Mato Grosso passes.

***
OIL...Nov contract eased $0.01 to $81.00 barrel, with a high of $81.29 and a low of $79.44 bsrrel. The
Dec contract fell $0.10 to $80.70 barrel with a high of $80.98and low of $79.20 barrel. Brent Oct ICE
shed $0.70 to $85.43 barrel with a high of $86.25 and low of $84.55 barrel. Tapis price rose $0.10 to
$88.82 barrel in Singapore/Malaysia.

***
Crude oil markets fell modestly, as the market continues to see a build in US commercial crude oil
stocks. Another rise this week in US crude oil stocks would follow two weeks of already large gains.
Pre-polling suggests the market is positioned for a fall in US distillate stocks, as improving seasonal
demand helps to drawdown product inventory.

Hedge funds pared back their biggest bullish coffee bet since 2008 as rains brought relief to
drought-stricken growing areas in Brazil, the world's biggest producer and exporter. Money managers cut
their net-long position in arabica coffee for the first time in four weeks. Futures in New York fell 9.1pc last
week, the most since May.
