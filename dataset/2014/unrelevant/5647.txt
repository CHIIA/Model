NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--September 24, 2014

OpenLink Financial LLC (OpenLink), the global leader in Transaction Lifecycle Management (TLM)
software, has been named ETRM Software House of the Year in the 2014 Energy Risk Asia Awards.
The designation honors OpenLink’s prowess in providing energy trading and risk management (ETRM)
systems and strong presence and growth in Asian markets.

During the first half of 2014, Asian customers reiterated their commitment to OpenLink by expanding the
scope of its commodity/energy trading and risk management (C/ETRM) installations. OpenLink is
experiencing significant growth in Asia and has substantially increased its customer base in the last 18
months. New deals include a Hong Kong-based petroleum company and a Malaysia-based oil firm. In
addition, as part of a strategic push into the Asian markets, OpenLink has further cemented alliances
with key regional third party firms.

OpenLink has earned a global reputation and has a proven track record of providing true, cross-market,
integrated solutions. Its C/ETRM products offer multi-commodity, multi-currency, and multi-units of
measure functionality in a real-time software application complemented by market-leading front to back
office capabilities, risk management and logistics on a single platform.
OpenLink’s Endur and RightAngle solutions serve the energy and commodity trading and risk
management needs of many firms engaged in financial and physical trading, and physical movement
and management of commodities including base and precious metals.
“For OpenLink, this prestigious award is validation of the company’s broad acceptance in Asia as a
market leader,” said Craig Bennett, Managing Director, OpenLink. “Our client base is continuing to grow
and our offerings continue to generate interest across the region’s regulated and unregulated energy
markets.”

OpenLink’s commitment to regulatory compliance leadership was also underscored.

“OpenLink has been expanding its presence in Asia over recent years and broadening its offering up and
down the commodity supply chain,” said Mark Pengelly, Editor of Energy Risk. “The firm is also doing
an excellent job at responding to the growing and more onerous ETRM needs imposed on Asia’s energy
traders by regulation.”
The Energy Risk Asia Awards recognize excellence across the Asian commodity and energy markets,
with a particular focus on client service. The awards are run by Energy Risk, the leading global title on
commodity trading and risk management, which is now in its 20th year. Entries for the awards are judged
by Energy Risk’s experienced editorial staff, with input from external industry sources.
