Melbourne developer and BRW Young Rich lister Tim Gurner is closing in on a major residential
development site in north Brisbane for about $33 million.
The 46,000 square metre site at 95 and 117 Mina Parade, Alderley, is owned by Abacus
Property Group and was valued between $10 million and $30 million at June 2014.

Abacus originally bought the site in 2007 for $13.8 million. The 23,000 sq m of warehouse, houses
various tenants with a weighted average lease expiry of 2.1 years.
The Alderley site is about six kilometres from the Brisbane city centre.
"Future plans envisage residential development and tenants are currently on short-term leases,"
Abacus said in its annual property compendium.
It is understood CBRE's Mike Walsh and Peter Court introduced the purchaser, but they declined
to comment on the sensitive deal.
Mr Gurner is in China and was unavailable. He has taken on Brisbane property developers by
launching a $600 million, luxury, high-rise project in Fortitude Valley.

The first stage of his Fortitude Valley development, known as the Flatiron, has 340 apartments.

Two other towers are included in the development.
It is not known what Mr Gurner has planned for the Alderley site which has city views and sits
opposite a railway. Architectural practice BVN has drawn up a concept plan for the site which
appears as a masterplan community with 103 dwellings a hectare.

A raft of major development sites formerly used for industrial purposes have come on to the market
in Brisbane in the last month.
Building materials company Hanson is selling off its major waterfront property in South Brisbane
with market expectations of up to $40 million.

Knight Frank, in conjunction with Colliers, has been appointed to sell Parmalat Australia's riverfront
sites at Montague Road.
The frenzy of activity began after The Australian Financial Review revealed Chinese groupR&F
Properties had contracted to buy Metro Property Development's South Brisbane and Kangaroo
Point sites for as much as $65 million.
An appeal stopping Metro's approved 20-storey residential tower project at the Kangaroo Point
site was dismissed on Wednesday, paving the way for the Chinese deal to go ahead.

self-interested residents," Metro chairman David Devine said. "The decision to appeal the original
approval was misguided and always destined for failure," he said.
