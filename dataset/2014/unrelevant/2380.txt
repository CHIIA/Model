The S&P/ASX200 closed down just 0.3 points to 5445.9 on good volume worth $4.3 billion. There were
519 issues higher and 497 down. The SPI Futures closed down 13 points to 5440 on average volume of
21,958 contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields were steady at 4.06%. The $A is at 90.13US, up about 55
points from last evening.

*The banks contributed 0.1 positive points to the index, insurers contributed 2.3 positive points, resources
contributed 0.6 negative points, property trusts were Neutral, retailers contributed 0.8 negative points,
Telstra contributed 2 negative points.

*At 4pm the Nikkei Dow futures was up 250 points to 15,130 points, Shanghai CSI physical was down
2.03 points to 2051.05, Hang Seng futures was up 97 points to 22,630 points, S&P futures was up 3

Our market is still at the highest level since September 2008 (a few points higher than the 5411.4 points
close on October 28 2013). The gains were stock specific, with no sector a standout while the market as a
whole was buoyed by a much better than expected trade balance surplus and a rise in retail sales.

"High will be 5433. Low will be 5410 .. close at 5431, down 15.2 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the SPI futures contract down 12 points. So long as our market does not trace out a new rally high this
week, the weight of evidence suggests we will witness a decline back to 5180 to 5250 points over the next
few weeks, which would be consistent with seasonal weakness this time of year. A new high today or
tomorrow however jeopardises this thesis.

"While there are a number of red flags casting long shadows over the market, price momentum remains
favourable on a near term basis so we watch with keen interest the next few days.

"The high will be 5453. The low will be 5410. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5431, down 15.2 points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 46 points to 5446.2 last evening.

*PBT: Recent prestigious report vindicates Prana's therapeutic strategy

Prana Biotechnology Ltd advised a landmark study in the current issue of the peer reviewed journal
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (PNAS) whose findings have demonstrated a
dose dependent relationship between copper levels and oligomerisation of Amyloid-B peptide, resulting in
toxicity. Clioquinol, PBT's proof of concept Metal Protein attenuating Compound (MPAC) rescued the
metal induced AB toxicity, a finding consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of Prana's PBT2.

One of the study's authors, Daniel Tardiff is quoted as stating, "Our work in the yeast model shows that
clioquiinol decreases the amount of AB in the cells by 90%. That's a strong decrease, and its dose
dependent. I've tested a lot of compounds before and I've never seen anything as dramatic.

Prana's co-founder and Chief Scientific Adviser, Dr Rudy Tanzi, Professor of Neurology at Harvard
Medical School said the new results in the publication by Prof Susan Lindquist and colleagues at the
Whitehead Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, "this very well crafted body of work from
the Lindquist laboratory points to the intrinsic value of Prana's therapeutic strategy to intercede in the
metal mediated toxicity of target aggregating proteins in neurodegeneration".

where awarded had experienced commencement delays. There are however industry expectations for an
improvement in 2015 driven by a need to replenish coal reserves to meet market demand.

*BIT: BIT 225 HIV/HCV trial patients virus free at six months
Biotron Ltd announced additional interim positive data from a key phase 2 trial of its lead antiviral drug
BIT225, in patients co-infected with HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Analysis of blood samples from patients indicated that all of the HCV genotype 3 patients completing
treatment are virus free at the 24 week (6 month) time point.

This extends previous data that showed patients with undetectable virus levels at 12 weeks.

Response to treatment at this time point is generally a good indication of final outcome at 48 weeks.
Preliminary data from patients who have completed 48 weeks of treatment indicate that they remain virus
free at this key time point.

Managing director Dr Michelle Miller said in the report, "This 24 week data further validates the efficacy of
BIT225 as a potential new therapy for HCV and in particular for this difficult to treat group of HIV/HCV
co-infected patients who typically have more serious HCV infection and lower response rates to treatment
with existing standard therapies.

In vitro assays have shown that BIT225 has pan-genotypic activity, apart from the genotype 1 variant of
the virus, the most common in Western populations, the data extended the company's clinical data
portfolio to include genotype 3, endemic in south-east Asia.

Regeneus Ltd announced a paper describing safety and early efficacy data for its Kvax cancer vaccine
has been published in Cancer Immunology Research, the peer reviewed journal published by the
American Association for Cancer Research.

personalised vaccine. The vaccine stimulates the patient's immune system to see the cancer cells as
foreign and helps prevent further growth of the tumour and development of new tumours.
