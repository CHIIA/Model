Australian shares broke a three-day losing streak to move higher as investors shrugged off news that
unemployment had hit a 10-year high and some worse-than-forecast Chinese trade data.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each added 0.2 per cent,
on Thursday to 5464.4 points and 5454.3 points respectively. Local shares were bumpy in early trade
after opening higher having followed a positive offshore lead.

United States equities closed modestly higher on Wednesday night following the release of minutes
from the June meeting of the Federal Reserve that detailed plans to finish tapering its program of
quantitative easing in October, provided the US economic recovery stays on track.
Clime Asset Management director John Abernethy highlighted the risks to global equity markets
outlined last week in a report from the Bank of International Settlements, known as the central
banker's bank. "There is a threat to financial stability as ultra-low interest rates promote debt
accumulation and risk-taking," Mr Abernethy said.
But many global equity investors remain optimistic that the bull run in US equities that has led the
rise across global markets can continue.

"If earnings pick up in the second half of 2014, as we anticipate, stocks will likely be able to grow into
current valuations and build on gains," Loomis Sayles senior equity strategist Richard Skaggs said.

Fidelity Worldwide Investment global chief investment officer equities Dominic Rossi conceded that
excess in the IPO market and corporate deal activity may be early warning signs of mature equity
markets, but said despite the risks of a short-term correction his medium-term outlook remains
bullish.

"I believe volatility can stay low for a sustained period, much like it did in the late 1990s, and feel the
strength and duration of the economic resurgence will surprise many," Mr Rossi said.

The local market dipped into negative territory on Thursday following the release of Australian Bureau
of Statistics data that showed the unemployment rate rose to 6 per cent last month. The result was
worse than consensus expectations for a smaller rise in joblessness to 5.9 per cent.

On a more positive note the participation rate was up slightly.
In China, National Bureau of Statistics showed the trade balance of the world's second largest
economy posted $US31.6 billion in June, missing consensus predictions for $US36.95 billion.
Imports and exports both rose..Jakarta buoyant on election

In Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index jumped 2 per cent to a 13-month high, while the rupiah
surged after Jakarta governor Joko Widodo cited exit polls to claim victory in the presidential election.

Tinto added 0.4 per cent to $62.41, after the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, edged up 0.1
per cent to $US96.60 a tonne. Junior iron ore miner Atlas Iron dropped 5.3 per cent to 62¢, despite
reporting record production in the June quarter that beat its guidance.

The big four banks were mixed. Commonwealth Bank of Australia edged up 0.1 per cent to $80.85 as
Standard & Poor's reiterated the bank's credit rating is unaffected by the scandal over its financial
planning practices. Westpac Banking Corporation lost 0.3 per cent to $33.75, ANZ Banking Group
edged down 0.1 per cent to $33.16, and National Australia Bank added 0.4 per cent to $33.39.
Banking and insurance companySuncorp Group dropped 0.4 per cent to $13.57 as Morgan Stanley
downgraded its recommendation to "underweight". Australia's biggest insurer QBE Insurance Group
lost 0.7 per cent to $11.27.
