Jokin Joe's First budget Surprise!! After a misplaced bullish start, the market sank into a stupor as await
the biggest Federal Budget since 2013.More leaks today on the number of public servants that will be
selling their holiday homes in Jervis Bay and I expect the ones that are left to be somewhat alarmed at the
escalation in job losses. Way push alert now! We had a financial sector that sprinted out of the blocks
helping the market to a high of 5480 before they realised that they were all alone and without support and
cup off in no man's land. In the end we closed down 12 points at 5448 after a low of 5432.Volume was
woeful at around $2.6 bn even an old and saggy super model wouldn't have got out of bed today. I know I
shouldn't have either. It was pretty much small losses across the board with BHP Billiton Limited (A$37.16,
-0.5%) suffering the most. Banks were mildly negative but everyone is waiting for Jokin Joe.

Gold and other resource stocks were weaker with Kingsgate Consolidated Limited (A$0.84, -4.5%) at
ridiculous levels. Oh how the mighty have fallen. In the industrials Flight Centre Travel Group Limited
(A$51.00, +1.2%) took off as did REA Group Ltd (A$46.78, +2.2%) but gamblers were down on their luck
with Crown Resorts Limited (A$15.74, -0.5%) easing, Donaco International Limited (A$1.065, -2.3%) also
falling as did Tatts Group Limited (A$3.01, -0.7%) and TAH. IT stocks eased too with Carsales.Com
Limited (A$10.41, -0.5%), NEA and Melbourne IT Limited (A$1.385, -4.5%) the worse of the bunch.
#XRO# rallied though taking their cue from US tech stocks. Healthcare stocks were mixed ResMed Inc.
(A$5.40, +0.9%) and Primary Health Care Limited (A$4.67, +1.5%) better as were Unilife Corporation
(A$0.58, +6.4%) but Cochlear Limited (A$59.10, unch) and Sonic Healthcare Limited (A$17.82, -0.4%) the
hedgehog eased slightly. Retailers were also easier as JB Hi-Fi Limited (A$19.30, -0.9%),David Jones
Limited (A$3.94, -0.3%) and Myer Holdings Limited (A$2.11, -0.9%) look forward to a confidence sapping
budget in the making. On the podium wearing the pink jersey were Skilled Group Limited (A$2.89,
+7.0%),Sirius Resources NL (A$3.10, +6.9%),McMillan Shakespeare Limited (A$11.00, +6.0%),G8
Education Limited (A$4.47, +5.9%),Air New Zealand Limited (A$2.03, +3.8%),Sirtex Medical Limited
(A$16.70, +3.1%) and AWE Limited (A$1.655, +2.8%) with DTM a winner in the mid-caps. Spinning off
and walking back to the pits today were Arrium Limited (A$1.06, -4.1%),Cardno Limited (A$6.89,
-3.1%),Syrah Resources Limited (A$3.60, -3.5%),Bluescope Steel Limited (A$6.10, -2.6%),Seven West
Media Limited (A$1.785, -2.7%),Atlas Iron Limited (A$0.815, -3.0%) and Select Harvests Limited (A$5.42,
-12.7%) and MCS in the smalls. Asian stocks were weaker with the exception of Chinese shares which
surged after government comments suggesting a "new normal" and the government moving to support
equities as they will relax limits on foreign investment in listed companies and expand quotas for capital
flow. Tokyo was unchanged but HK and Shanghai up 2%.The Aussie dollar 93.63 Digital tulips $464 and
good old fashioned gold $12.88. Stocks and Stories Incitec Pivot Limited (A$2.85, +1.1%) lifted its first
half profit 7 per cent thanks to strong growth from one of its ammonium nitrates plants and reduced
costs.The company made a net profit of $115.7 million for the six months to March 31, up from $107.9
million a year ago. Hurting the big miners today was news that a strike at Port Headland is moving a step
closer as some tugboat workers aligned to the Maritime Union of Australia took a major step toward
industrial action today with a vote to strike. However nothing will happen before a meeting with Fair work
on May 20th. Bad news for Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (A$4.72, -1.9%) and BHP Billiton Limited
(A$37.16, -0.5%) but RIO Tinto Limited (A$61.00, +0.1%) uses their own facilities at Cape Lambert so not
quite so exposed. G8 Education Limited (A$4.47, +5.9%) rallied hard today on news of their debt raising of
$150 million to help finance the acquisition of more centres. The offer, which was priced in Singapore
dollars, raised $SGD175 million ($150 million), at a 4.75 per cent per annum coupon for a three year
term, maturing in May 2017.It is as easy as ABC really. National Australia Bank Limited (A$34.18, -0.6%)
joined the herd today with its estimate of no more rate cuts. They also up their GDP forecast modestly and

Page72of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.now expects GDP growth at 2.9 per cent in 2013/14 (was 2.7 per cent) and 3.1 per cent in 2014/15 (was
3.0 per cent). Things didn't go better with Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (A$9.13, -0.2%) for the architect of
their alcoholic beverages strategy, John Murphy, who lost his job as part of an organisational restructure
by new group managing director Alison Watkins. Another day another bid as Dart Energy Limited (A$0.16,
+28.0%) has been approached by UK group IGas with an all shares offer worth around 19cents.
Tomorrow's News Today Another one bites the dust as Newcastle MP Tim Owen has become the latest
state Liberal to fall on his sword over revelations that donations from developers were illegally channelled
into his 2011 election campaign. Call ours a crisis Joe....this is a crisis...Japan's national debt totalled a
record-high &yen;1.02 quadrillion as of the end of March, up &yen;33.36 trillion from a year earlier, the
Finance Ministry said. The UK now has more billionaires per capita than anywhere else at
104!!Combined total of $300bn in assets etc. Of course rarely do they pay any tax which is why they have
become billionaires in the first place. I was amazed to see that the founder of a real estate agency is now
worth over 1 billion pounds! And still in the UK, Shale gas could be fuelling British homes for the first time
by late 2015( I always thought it was Readybrek that fuelled homes), under plans from fracking firm
Cuadrilla. The company is preparing to submit planning applications by the end of this month to frack at
two sites in Lancashire next year. Few tips if you are inside trading. Don't make too many flash purchases.
Don't brag on twitter or use linkedin to your mate at the ABS and don't deal on a platform that makes your
big trades look like the proverbial dogs things. I reckon it would be pretty hard to work out what the Aussie
dollar is going to do even if you had the numbers beforehand. It's a lottery! It is all about the budget and
tomorrow night we will get to see the razor gangs work. We know so much already but sure to be one or
two surprises but Sir Humphrey would be proud of his PM's "Courageous" decisions. I suspect the rest of
us will be less than impressed. Why not put GST up while you are at it Joe? That is all.
