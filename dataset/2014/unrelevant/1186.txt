SYDNEY, Aug 14 (Reuters) - More wealthy Chinese are moving their money out of China to invest in
Australia's property market as a corruption crackdown in the world's second biggest economy gathers
momentum, property consultants and lawyers said.

They said their clients had told them they had legitimate funds to invest but were concerned about
being caught up in an investigation, which in China often delves into the affairs of dozens of associates
of the main target, and losing that wealth.
"What we see at the moment is that there are more Chinese who would likely send more money out of
the country so they don't get caught up in this crackdown," David Green-Morgan, global capital markets
research director at real estate services firmJones Lang LaSalle (JLL), told Reuters.
It's one of the most visible signs of the fear being caused in China by President Xi Jinping 's
18-month-old drive against the pervasive graft that he says threatens the Communist Party 's survival,
a fear that is even causing some officials to take their own lives.

Beijing's campaign has particularly targeted so-called "naked officials", the term for state employees
whose spouses or children live overseas. Those officials are generally suspected by the party of using
such connections to illegally move assets.
Ordinary Chinese citizens can legally transfer only $50,000 overseas each year, but vast sums leak
out of China using a variety of loopholes, such as funnelling money through the Chinese territory of
Hong Kong.
"The restrictions in China are becoming more onerous," Green-Morgan said. "That's triggered an
increase in the amount of money that's looking to move out of China or probably is already outside of
China and is looking to be spent."

SAFE HAVEN
Australian property has long been a popular choice for Chinese money - both legitimate and
illegitimate - but the flow of investment appears to have accelerated of late.
According to Australia's foreign investment review board, China was the No.1 source of foreign capital
investment into Australia's real estate in 2013. It received approvals to invest nearly A$6 billion ($5.58
billion) into the sector, up 41 percent from a year ago.

"They are worried so they are looking for a safe place," said a Sydney-based immigration lawyer, who
is advising on setting up a new fund exclusively for Chinese investors and regularly travels to Beijing
and Shanghai.

"They don't want returns, not necessarily. They want a safe place," he added.

next decade, up from $11.5 billion last year, property agent Savills has forecast.
That will help push Chinese demand in Australian property by 15 percent over the next 12 months,
said Andrew Taylor, co-CEO of Juwai.com, the largest real estate portal that targets Chinese buyers
looking abroad.
Such strong interest is likely to boost Australia's apartment construction, which is set to hit record
levels by 2017 and remain elevated through to 2020, Brokerage CLSA said in a report this month titled
"The Magic Dragon".

FAVOURED DESTINATION
Wealthy Chinese have long been pouring money into real estate in major cities in North America,
Europe and Asia, including New York, London and Sydney.
But some of their favourite markets are becoming less attractive for Chinese investors: A 15 percent
stamp duty introduced for foreign buyers in Hong Kong and Singapore, where cash-rich mainland
Chinese had been blamed for driving up prices, has cooled interest, while Canada recently cancelled
its Immigrant Investor Program, popular with wealthy Chinese.

Australia, in contrast, may ease rules on a visa scheme aimed at luring investment from wealthy
Chinese after complaints that disclosure requirements are too strict, lawyers and migration agents
have said.
Australia is now the second-most favoured destination for Chinese property buyers, behind the United
States but ahead of Canada and Britain, according to Juwai.
Property investment into Australia provides an emigration option to Chinese buyers and can also
establish a base for their children's education in an English-speaking country.

It also offers the kind of robust, independent legal system sought by those looking to shield their assets
from the Chinese authorities.
"A somewhat more disturbing motivation for emigration and shifting capital out of China is that many
are seeking protection of their wealth for both economic and political reasons," CLSA's Andrew
Johnston said, without elaborating.

TIP OF THE ICEBERG
An Australian government inquiry into foreign residential real estate investment policy is due to report
on Oct. 11, but consultants and researchers Reuters spoke to did not expect any rule changes that
could hurt the construction sector.
Existing regulations restrict non-residents to buying only new-build property.
Chinese property developers have been aggressively investing abroad to cater to domestic demand
and to diversify their assets in response to a cooling property market at home.
Hong Kong-listed Wanda Commercial Properties has set up a $1.6 billion fund to invest in Australian
real estate, while China's Greenland Holding sold every apartment in a Sydney project last year
within the first three hours for a total of 2 billion yuan ($325 million).
Century21 and Fairfax Media 's Domain.com, Australian real estate portals, have launched Chinese
language websites, and REA Group recently announced that SouFun, a major real estate online
marketplace in China, would carry Australian listings.
Australian developers are also flying to China to promote their properties.
