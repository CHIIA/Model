FREEDOM Foods has struck a landmark deal with China’s New Hope Group that will see tens of
millions of dollars invested in Australian dairy farms.

Under a memorandum of understanding signed in Canberra yesterday evening, the parties will cooperate
exclusively to develop and implement growth in long-term dairy milk supply through establishment of new
large scale intensive dairy farms in Victoria.

The farms will supply Freedom Foods Group’s UHT operations and other potential processing operations
in Australia including fresh milk.
New Hope has established an investment fund of up to $500 million to be invested in Australian
agriculture and part of these funds, along with funds from the Perich family, will be invested in the new
dairy capacity.
The management of future farm operations will be undertaken by the Perich Group, through a separate
farm management services agreement.
The Perich Group, which is run by billionaires Tony and Ron Perich, runs one of the nation’s biggest
dairies west of Sydney.
The family has a 60 per cent stake in Freedom Foods.

Managing director of Freedom Foods Mr Rory Macleod said in a statement today: “Australia has a unique
advantage in the supply and manufacture of high quality premium agriculture based foods.
“With increasing demand from markets in China and Southeast Asia for high quality, value added
product, Australia, through companies such as Freedom Foods and Perich Group, are well placed to play
an important role in the development of this important supply chain.”
