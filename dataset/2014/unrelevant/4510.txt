BHP Billiton said Friday it would likely spin-off its unwanted assets into a separate company after the
mining giant was unable to find a buyer for its Nickel West operation in Western Australia. The
Melbourne-based company said it would focus on its “four pillars” of iron ore, copper, coal and
petroleum – with potentially a fifth in potash – and demerge its other assets.
BHP had reportedly been seeking around $1 billion for its Nickel West operation, which comprises the
Kwinana refinery, Mt Keith mine, Leinster nickel plant and Kalgoorlie smelter and concentrator. It had
hoped a resurgent nickel price caused by the export ban in Indonesia from January would have helped
attract a buyer.

But after reviewing the company’s portfolio since April this year, the miner decided a “demerger of its
assets is our preferred option.”

In a July 14 research note resent Friday, UBS analysts said Nickel West had been “in decline for a
number of years and could potentially have a $1-2 billion environmental liability” that any purchaser
would have to take on. UBS mentioned Glencore, which operates the nearby Murrin Murrin nickel-cobalt
mine, or Chinese companies as potential buyers.

Nickel prices have increased around 30% since the start of the year, which has seen the share prices of
nickel producers such as Perth-based Western Areas more than double over the period. Indonesia
supplied around 23% of the global nickel market, and Chinese nickel pig iron producers have been
scurrying around seeking other suppliers, notably in the Philippines.
Speaking at the Noosa Mining & Exploration Conference in Queensland last month, KPMG director Matt
Pedley said the Indonesian ban could drive some serious M&A activity among Australian nickel
companies. In a July research note, analysts at ANZ bank said the “supply shock” caused by the
Indonesian ban that “sent nickel prices to a two year high is far from over and is likely to put further
upward pressure on prices over the next few years.”
