NEW YORK--U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday, as the market paused in its recent run to record
highs.

While the S&P 500 has carved out a series of record highs, traders and investment managers say the
market is in a holding pattern until they can get a clearer picture of the U.S. economy's strength.
Meanwhile, they're keeping an eye on developments in Ukraine and the pace of growth in China, but
making little in the way of major new bets.

Stocks traded little changed for most of the session until a late-afternoon swoon took the benchmark
indexes down to the day's lows before they recovered slightly.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 67.43 points, or 0.4%, to end at 16351.25. The Dow was down as
many as 93.51 points in intraday trade.

The S&P 500 index lost 9.54 points, or 0.5%, to 1867.63, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gave up
27.26 points, or 0.6%, to 4307.19.

The S&P 500 has gained 0.4% so far in March, after running up 4.3% in February, and it is hovering
within range of Friday's record closing high of 1878.04. The Dow was 1.4% away from its Dec. 31 record
high of 16576.66.

Tuesday's decline occurred in light volume and wasn't based on any news event, traders said.
Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said there wasn't much going on in the
market to indicate that the afternoon weakness is anything other than just "typical market gyration."

"We're just bouncing around in a range," Mr. Winer said. "We're in this period, where we're waiting to see
what the next big thing is going to be."
Sam Wardwell, investment strategist at Pioneer Investments, which oversees about $230 billion, said
that while the situation in Ukraine remains a downside risk, barring military action by Russia, continued
improvement in the economy should support further gains. He has been telling clients there is no need to
be reducing exposure to stocks at the moment.

"There's no need to take risk off. Do not get defensive now. The market is not imbalanced," Mr. Wardwell
said. "As long as we don't have gunshots [in Ukraine], the market will be pretty calm."

On the economic front, wholesale inventories for January rose 0.6% on the month, topping expectations
of a 0.4% increase. The National Federation of Independent Business's small-business optimism index
for February came in at 91.4, down from 94.1 in January and missing expectations of 93.4.
Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, which has $237 billion in assets under
management, said the market has settled down after a volatile two months and stocks could hold close to
current levels for a few more weeks as investors await further readings on the economy.

have a fairly stable picture. We need new data points to drive the market."

In general, Mr. Memani said clients haven't been moving money in or out of stocks recently, but "they are
just shifting positions" they already own.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note inched lower to 2.767% from 2.784% late Monday.
Gold futures gained 0.4% to settle at $1,346.50 an ounce. Crude-oil futures fell 1.1% to $100.03 a
barrel, after falling 1.4% on Monday.

The dollar lost some ground against the yen while strengthening slightly against the euro.

European markets were mixed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 edging fractionally higher to snap a
three-session losing streak.

Russia's Micex shed 2.3%, and has lost 9.4% so far this month.

Asian markets were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average gained 0.7% after the Bank of Japan
left its highly-stimulative monetary policy unchanged. China's Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%.

In corporate news, Jos. A. Bank Clothiers gained 3.9% after agreeing to be acquired by Men's
Wearhouse for about $1.8 billion, ending a contentious takeover battle between the rival men's suit
retailers. Men's Wearhouse rose nearly 5%.

Dow component McDonald's Corp. rose 3.8% after Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said at a
conference presentation that the company was pushing to stabilize its U.S. operation after four straight
months of falling same-store sales.

General Motors slid 5.2% after the auto maker stepped up an internal investigation, seeking to answer
mounting questions over why it took nearly a decade to recall 1.6 million vehicles for faulty ignitions
linked to 13 deaths.
