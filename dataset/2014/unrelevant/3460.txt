INTRIGUE surrounds Echelon Property Management, a Gold Coast company that a year ago was
touting plans for a 1200-lot subdivision in the central Queensland mining town of Emerald.
The company, which initially had barrister Gary Radcliff heading its upper echelons, last month
canned the project, Highfields.

The Emerald foray reportedly lost more than $1 million for Echelon, which no longer operates from
Bundall’s Corporate Centre.
The company still has a website but a call to a 1300 number brought a response that Echelon no
longer existed and is now called SV Capital.

A former staffer said that was not right and litigation over $3.5 million was brewing as a result of
shareholder disputes.

Early last year, when Mr Radcliff chaired Echelon, his team included chief executive Shane Reynolds
and former Lang Walker staffer Steve McRae.

Echelon boasted that a team of professionals had been enlisted to oversee the First Echelon
Property Fund, a trust that was to be capped at $50 million, and to evaluate potential development
projects.

The chairman of the fund trustee was former city council planning head Ted Shepherd.

Last April Echelon shareholder Mark Minter, a retired NSW police inspector, voiced concerns about
Echelon’s direction, and Mr Radcliff and others departed.
In October, Echelon trumpeted that a Chinese group was to provide $35 million in funding for
Highfields.
The exuberance did not last, with Echelon in early December revealing the contract to buy the
Highfields site for $20 million had been terminated.

It said an 11th-hour offer by Echelon to pay an unconditional $10.3 million within 30 days had been
“steadfastly declined” by the seller.
The company has a paid-up capital of $711,000, with $500,000 of that held by Mr Minter and
$200,000 by Sandra Dunn.

The directors are listed on ASIC as Gold Coast resident Kevin Mcmullan and Sydney businessman
Ian Lazar, who was appointed on January 6.

majority shareholders to “litigate company debt owed to the group in relation to shareholder
disputes”.The big unanswered question is: Who’s footing the bill for the $1 million-plus loss at
Emerald.
