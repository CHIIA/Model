RIO Tinto chief Sam Walsh says the market should not be surprised by factors that have sent iron
ore prices sliding and he is confident Chinese growth will underpin long-term commodities demand.
And the mining boss has sent a message to his Glencore counterpart Ivan Glasenberg: that the
Swiss trader-miner will have to offer more to merge its Hunter Valley coal operations with those of
Rio.

Speaking at the opening of a copper and coal processing centre of excellence in Brisbane
yesterday, Mr Walsh said copper and iron ore prices were being hit by declining Chinese steel
capacity and credit tightening flagged six months ago.

``Some people are surprised, but it was signalled by the government,'' he said. ``They expected
about 80 million tonnes of steel capacity would come off.''
What was important was that Chinese growth would remain strong and that Rio's cash costs of
$US20.70 per tonne were the lowest in the game, he said.
Iron ore prices, which hit a 12-month low of $US104.70 per tonne this week, rose 2.4 per cent to
$US107.40 last night.
``We have seen a recovery in the past couple of days, with iron ore prices strengthening -- where
that ends up, the market will determine,'' Mr Walsh said.
Glencore's Mr Glasenberg last week talked up the potential for a merger of the NSW coal
operations of Rio and Glencore.

``There's a lot to be done where we can get substantial synergies, so we're talking to Rio Tinto, but it
takes time for both sides to assess each other's assets,'' Mr Glasenberg told analysts last week.

``We've been talking to them for a long time. How we'll get and how soon we can reach an
agreement, I don't know, but it's something that clearly makes a lot of economic sense.''

It appears any offer from Glencore is well below Rio's idea of where it should be.
``Our coal operations are long-life quality operations,'' Mr Walsh said.

``If somebody is interested in putting a worthwhile proposal to us, well that's exactly what they should
do.'' Mr Walsh said the looming end-of-March project finance deadline for the Oyu Tolgoi
underground copper and goldmine in Mongolia would not cause Rio to rush an investment
framework through on the stalled expansion.

``We are not about rushing to meet a deadline,'' he said.

Last night, Mr Walsh received the lifetime achievement award from Melbourne University's Faculty of
Business and Economics alumni. The former commerce student, who spent much of his 43-year

life to live and a difference to make.
``I still wake up every morning with a spring in my step, a mischievous glint in the eye which I'm sure
isn't a cataract, and a great passion for what I do. And, while I apologise for the cliche, I can only
confirm it is vital to truly love what you do, and take time to celebrate along the journey,'' Mr Walsh
said.
