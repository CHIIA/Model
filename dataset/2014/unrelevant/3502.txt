RWE (CM) Nesscap Energy Inc Reports Record First Quarter Results for Ultracapacitor Products
Sydney - Tuesday - June 03 (RWE) - Nesscap Energy Inc [TSX VENTURE:NCE], a global leader in
research, development and manufacturing of ultracapacitor products, reported its financial results for the
first quarter ended March 31, 2014.

Revenue for the three-month period increased 66%, to US $5.3 million, compared to $3.2 million in the
same period last year.

The increase in revenue is due to stronger demand from new and existing customers.

Gross profit margin for the quarter improved to 22% compared to 11% in the same quarter last year and
21% for fiscal 2013.
Net loss for the quarter was $0.1 million or $0.001 per share compared to a net loss of $0.6 million or
$0.003 per share in the same period in fiscal 2013.

The improvement in net loss was mainly due to increased sales volumes combined with reduced unit
production costs.
At March 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents equal to $3.7 million and working
capital of $15.9 million.

"Our success in the first quarter was driven by a combination of strong market demand and improved
efficiencies in our factory," said Jim Zuidema, Acting Chief Executive Officer of Nesscap.

"Demand for Nesscap's products has strengthened over the past few quarters and, as a result, we see an
increasing need to invest in production capacity and technology development to expand our share of the
growing market for alternative energy-storage solutions.
The company recently announced that it has engaged Marathon Capital, LLC as exclusive advisor, in
connection with a proposed equity financing, and that I2BF Energy Limited and Arbat Capital Group Ltd
have agreed to participate as lead investors, with a minimum subscription amount of US $10 million.

a bridge financing for up to $2.0 million.
Detailed terms of the loan and financing can be found in the company's March 19, 2014 press release as
well as the fiscal 2013 MD&A Nesscap continues to focus on developing its largest regional markets in
Europe and China while strengthening its overall position as a technology leader in the ultracapacitor
