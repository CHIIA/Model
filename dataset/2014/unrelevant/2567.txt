Students’ highrise to tower in the CBD WORK has begun on Brisbane’s next high rise tower.

Sydney-based Iglu, a specialist developer, operator and owner of purpose-built, off-campus
accommodation, has settled on an $8 million purchase of a 922sq m development site at 65 Mary St.

De Martini Fletcher development manager John Lunney said the two-level office/retail building that
was built 30 years ago had reached the end of its “useful life”.
“We’ve been assessing the site for a while in terms of our own application and we were approached
by the Iglu guys who had done a bit of work on the student accommodation concept and that’s not
something that we delve into,” Mr Lunney said.
“It was assessed to be a better proposition to sell it to them than develop the site on our own.” Iglu,
which is majority owned by Macquarie Capital and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, will build a
23-level 414-bed tower on the site.

Demolition work has begun already and the tower is scheduled to be completed by 2016.
Interland Group-Property Advisors’ Kevin Jenkins, who struck the sale deal, said the property was
sold off-market.
He said because the site has a car parking issue, it was well suited to the student accommodation
sector.

“You have parking restraints for these smaller buildings if you are going to develop them into
residential units,” he said.

Mr Jenkins, who formed Interland 18 months ago with two colleagues, has helped Keith George Pty
Ltd to dispose of over $15 million of property in Milton and co-ordinated the auction of three
properties at Tamborine Mountain.
One of the properties was a 2633sq m site at 20 Walsh St, Milton, which has gone unconditional to a
Chinese group. The property has DA approval for two 20-storey residential towers.Also, Interland
has sold apartments for TDD Pty Ltd (Peninsular) Kangaroo Point in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and,
through an associate in Singapore, will be setting up offices there after a Singapore Real Estate
licence is granted.
