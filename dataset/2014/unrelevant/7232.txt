Finbar and joint-venture partner Perth Upper China Hotel will develop a 32-storey apartment
complex valued at $150 million at 63 Adelaide Terrace.
Perth Upper China Hotel, will pay $15 million for the 3406sqm East Perth site which was owned by
the Perron Group.

In a statement yesterday, Finbar said Perth Upper China Hotel would contribute $20 million to fund
the purchase of the land and provide working capital. Finbar will contribute $10 million towards
working capital, development finance and the redevelopment of the site.
Finbar and Perth Upper China Hotel will share in the profits and Finbar will also earn a management
fee.

According to a preliminary design, the project will have 200 apartments and ground floor
commercial lots. An office and showroom is on the site, which is 150m from Langley Park and
300m from the Perth foreshore and offers future views of the city, the Swan River, Heirisson Island
and the Burswood Peninsula.

Finbar managing director Darren Pateman said the new project would fill a looming shortage in the
company’s apartment pipeline.

“With the exception of our Concerto project, where sales are progressing well and construction will
commence shortly, we have a shortage of new apartments in our project pipeline coming on stream
over the next couple of years in East Perth,” Mr Pateman said.

Design work for the new project has started and it is anticipated a marketing launch will start late in
2015 and construction in 2016.
