Gina Rinehart has followed fellow iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest's lead and expanded her
interest to include cattle farming, reportedly spending $40 million on a half stake in two cattle
stations in the Kimberley.
The purchase was made through Hancock Prospecting, which bought a 50 per cent stake in the
Liveringa and Nerrima cattle stations.

The stations cover around 4,700 square kilometres collectively.
Hancock said it would enter a joint venture with Milne Agrigroup parent company Dowford
Investments to expand and develop the stations' prime beef production facilities.

The deal follows Mr Forrest's Minderoo Group buying the state's largest beef processor, Harvey
Beef, in May.
Minderoo said it would upgrade the Harvey Beef facilities to meet growing demand for beef in China
and other emerging markets.
Mr Forrest has previously stated a desire to open a live cattle export market to China, proposing a
100-year agricultural partnership between China and Australia.
Harvey Beef is the state's only accredited beef exporter to China.
