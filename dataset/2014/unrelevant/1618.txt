A MAINLAND Chinese developer has snapped up a site owned by the Buxton family dynasty for $30.4
million in another sign of a changing of the guard in Melbourne.
Brilliland Group purchased the property, marking is first foray into the Australian property market.
The parcel located at 51-65 Clarke Street in Southbank was sold without any planning permits in place.
However, several other sites along Clarke Street have secured planning permits.

The substantial 1790sq m plot, sold at almost $17,000 a square metre, is home to a low-rise office
building that is leased to tenants on a short-term basis.

The land runs between Hancock and Catherine streets and is located close to Crown Casino and the
popular inner city suburb of South Melbourne.
“The sale is also further evidence of the sustained interest from Chinese developers wanting to secure
development sites in the immediate proximity of the Melbourne CBD, presenting many of the same
benefits as the CBD in terms of amenities and access to transport routes,” said CBRE agent Mark
Wizel, who along with colleagues Josh Rutman and Ed Wright negotiated the sale.The deal comes as
the state government in Victoria prepares for a state election on November 29, where the Labor Party is
expected to win office and possibly shake up planning application procedures in the wake of a host of
controversial approvals by Planning Minister Matthew Guy.
