Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens had to admit milk prices weren’t his area of expertise as a
student quizzed him during a parliamentary hearing in Brisbane last week.

Cheneya Freese, the community captain at Faith Lutheran College in southern Queensland’s Lockyer
Valley, is also the 17-year-old daughter of former dairy farmers.

‘‘No farmer, either in Australia or New Zealand, has been paid $8 to $9 per litre which is the retail
price sold in China after freight,’’ Cheneya said.

‘‘How does a lowering Aussie dollar impact local exports?’’
In reply, Mr Stevens told the student from the Plainland school the Chinese market offered
opportunities for Australian producers.
‘‘I’m not an expert on milk pricing to be honest,’’ he said, before a committee of federal MPs.

Later another student, Melonie Gabrielle, from St Francis College at Crestmead, asked about high
youth unemployment in her home city of Logan, south of Brisbane.

‘‘There are very high levels of youth unemployment in some areas, including ours, in Logan where it’s
currently above 20 per cent,’’ the Year 12 business student said.

‘‘What can you do to channel investment into these areas to improve employment prospects for
young people?’’

Mr Stevens said policy settings needed to stimulate employment.

‘‘We can ask, more broadly, what we do to make it easier for young people to get a job,’’ he said.

Melonie is planning to study to become a special education teacher while Cheneya has her mind set
on becoming a beef cattle producer, following the completion of a degree in agribusiness.

After watching Labor and Liberal MPs, minus an absent Clive Palmer, grill Australia’s most powerful
central banker, only Mitchell Brimblecombe, the 17-year-old school captain at Faith Lutheran College,
expressed an aspiration to become a politician.

‘‘Politics could be something of interest,’’ he said following the hearing.

But after a career in agriculture.
