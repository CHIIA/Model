Tasmanian Pure Foods, a baby and toddler food company, is preparing an initial public offering
worth about $95 million, sources told Street Talk.
Wilson HTM will manage the deal, which involves $30 million of new equity and a $30 million to
$40 million sell-down of existing shares.

Funds raised are earmarked for working capital expenditure and further research and development
of the company's product range.

Launceston-based Tasmanian Pure Foods owns Bellamy's Organic, which produces infant formula,
toddler milk, snacks, cereals and ready-to-eat meals, all made with 100 per cent Australian organic
foods.
It supplies 3000 outlets in Australia, including Coles and Woolworths. The group has a 12 per cent
share of the local formula and baby food market.
The pitch to new investors will include the ability to expand its reach into the lucrative Chinese
market and its emerging middle class, which Tasmanian Pure Foods has already had some success
pursuing with its Bellamy's brand. Bellamy's also exports to Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong,
Vietnam and New Zealand.
Tasmanian Pure Foods' revenue has soared from $3 million in 2007 to $29.5 million in 2013.
On current sales, the 2014 turnover is forecast to be more than $50 million and chief executive
Laura McBain's next target is turnover of $100 million.

The IPO comes amid a flurry of corporate activity in the FMCG industry: Goodman Fielder's suitors
are preparing to sweeten their 65¢ a share offer, while Saputo won a fierce takeover battle for
Warrnambool Cheese & Butter in February.
Private equity firm Anacacia Capital also sold baby food supplier Rafferty's Garden to PZ Cussons
last year.
