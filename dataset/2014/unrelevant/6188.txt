Stockland is sitting on a tempting $90 million consolation profit after being blown off its bid for real
estate companyAustraland Property by Singaporean group Frasers Centrepoint’s surprise $2.6
billion all-cash swoop.
Stockland is considering its next move but, with the company unlikely to match the cash offer, it is
expected to sell its 19.9 per cent stake in Australand into Frasers’ $4.48-a-share bid.

Frasers’ intervention came to light yesterday, with Australand revealing the board had conditionally
endorsed the rival offer and opened its books for four weeks of exclusive due diligence.

Frasers, controlled by Thai beer baron Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, has $10 billion of assets
straddling Singapore, China and Australia, having arrived in Australia about 10 years ago.
In WA, the merged group would combine Frasers’ serviced apartment tower in East Perth with
Australand’s residential developments, including city apartments and land estates such as Port
Coogee and Jindowie in Yanchep.

Frasers’ takeover proposal also includes Australand’s forecast dividend for the June half year of
12.75¢ a share, increasing the value of its offer to $4.6075, as well as a similar pro-rata second-half
payment, which will accrue until the offer becomes unconditional.

Sydney-based Australand’s chairman, Paul Isherwood, said Frasers’ offer represented a superior and
“compelling value outcome” against Stockland’s all-scrip bid, which values Australand at $4.50 a
share.
Frasers described the potential tie-up as a transformational transaction that would “deepen our roots
and accelerate our growth” in a core market offering long-term growth.

Chief executive Lim Ee Seng said it would “catapult Frasers to being one of Australia’s leading real
estate companies with a portfolio of scale and quality”.
“The group chose to enter the Australian market over a decade ago due to favourable fundamentals,
including its transparent regulatory environment, strong corporate governance as well as its deep and
mature property market,” he said.

But while its hospitality business had provided Frasers with “an established platform and good brand
recognition”, real estate “is a business where scale and depth matters”.

Australand has been a target since Singapore’s CapitaLand announced plans last year to quit its 58
per cent stake in the group.

Stockland made its move in March, buying 115.2 million shares at about $3.72 apiece. By accepting
Frasers’ offer, it would realise a quick $88 million profit.
