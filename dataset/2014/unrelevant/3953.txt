Goodman Group's biggest global logistics project is a 128,000-square metre fulfilment centre in
Wroclaw, Poland, being built for online retailing giant Amazon.

The facility, which will take less than a year to build and is due to open this year, could comfortably fit
six Melbourne Cricket Grounds inside, with room to spare.

The scale of the project – the largest logistics facility in Europe – is an indication of the impact of
online retailing on the global industrial development market.

Amazon sells about $US32 billion worth of goods in Europe every year. Every item needs to be
delivered, sorted, stored, picked, packed and distributed to purchasers from hubs like the Wroclaw
site.
A report by global property services group JLL estimated business to consumer e-commerce sales
totalled $US1.2 trillion in 2013, with the sector posting a growth rate of about 15 per cent since 2007
compared with less than 1 per cent for the retail sector as a whole.

According to JLL, Britain is the biggest adopter of online shopping (almost one in 10 sales by value is
completed online) followed by the US, Australia, Germany and France.

"E-commerce represents the latest big driver of change in retail logistics and physical distribution
networks."

Forrester Research estimates total online retail sales in the Asia-Pacific region's largest markets –
China, Japan, South Korea, India and Australia – will grow to $US827 billion by 2018; an increase of
$US430 billion from 2013.

By 2020, there will 346 million online users in the region.

"E-tailing growth is only the tip of the iceberg in Australia," CBRE's head of industrial for Australia and
New Zealand, Matt Haddon, says.
