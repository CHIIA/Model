2249 GMT [Dow Jones] Private equity suitors Pacific Equity Partners and KKR & Co. have opted
against pitching a final bid for SAI Global Ltd. (SAI.AU), yet a number of parties have shown interest in
some of the businesses. That, says J.P. Morgan, is natural given the disparate assets that make up SAI
aren't a neat fit for any one peer. Still, the brokerage notes an offer for the whole company was a much
cleaner transaction and any break up or sale of individual assets needs to consider other factors such
as tax implications and the return profile of the remaining business. As such, J.P. Morgan's price target
on SAI reverts to A$4.40/share ($3.98) from A$5.18. It retains a neutral recommendation.

SAI last traded at A$4.18. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2245 GMT [Dow Jones] A debt restructure looks imminent at Africa-focused mineral-sands miner Base
Resources Ltd. (BSE.AU), which J.P. Morgan says could be a positive catalyst for the stock. The broker
cites comments by Base Resources management that proposed terms for a restructure of the Kwale
Project Finance Facility, which supports its mineral sands project in Kenya, have already been agreed
with all lenders. Under the terms of the restructure, all principal repayments will be deferred by six
months, J.P. Morgan says. The first principal repayment will be deferred to June 2015 and the current
portion of borrowings will be reduced to A$12 million ($10.8 million) from A$50 million. J.P. Morgan
rates Base Resources at overweight, with a A$0.50 ($0.45) price target. BSE last traded at A$0.28.

18:37 ET [DOW JONES} Expect imminent action from the U.S. Treasury Department on inversions. "I'm
hopeful that we're going to be able to take action very, very soon," U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew
said at an event hosted by the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Mr. Lew said he'd met with his
inversion team Tuesday on the actions being prepared and would discuss the plans with them again
while he's in Australia for the G20 finance ministers meeting this weekend. Unless Treasury plans to
announce the actions while the secretary is on the other side of the world, that would put an official
announcement into next week at the earliest. (ian.talley@wsj.com)

18:14 EDT - Nice timing on the temporary reauthorization of the US Export-Import Bank until next June.
On the agenda for its board meeting Thursday is an application for a loan guarantee from a unit of
Brazilian airline Gol for aircraft engine maintenance. Gol previously used just such a guarantee to park
engine work at Delta Air Lines (DAL), an arch-critic of Exim's current practices. Colombia's Avianca, Air
China, Ethiopian Airlines and Virgin Australia among the carriers that have lined up for Exim backing for
jet deals in recent weeks. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

18:10 EDT - The world's most powerful finance minister waded--just barely--into the Scottish
independence question on the eve of the vote, warning that secession could create economic problems.
"We think a strong, united UK is important," US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew says in response to a
question at an event hosted by the UCLA Anderson School of Management. "It's an internal debate
within the UK right now, but obviously there are potentially significant economic ramifications and I think
we're all watching with great interest what happens tomorrow." (ian.talley@wsj.com)
18:08 EDT - Avison Young, a fast growing Canadian commercial real estate services company, has
made another acquisition in the New York City region: Kwartler Associates, a New Jersey-based
property management firm. Mark Rose, Avison Young's chief executive, declined to reveal the price
Avison paid for the family-owned firm that manages about 50 properties with more than 5.1M square

acquisition binge in which Avison Young has paid over $100M for about 30 companies over the past
five years. The Kwartler deal is expected to be announced Thursday. (peter.grant@wsj.com)

18:04 EDT - US Attorney General Eric Holder joins the chorus of public officials calling for individuals to
be held responsible for white-collar crimes, an approach that has recently been scaring compliance
officers. But he also concedes that such prosecutions currently face hurdles and called for potential
changes in the law. "The buck needs to stop somewhere where corporate misconduct is concerned. We
ought to consider this further and modify our laws where appropriate," he says. (rachel.ensign@wsj.com;

18:01 EDT - Stability in the polls is bad for Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's chances of re-election at
this point, Eurasia Group says. Public support for Rousseff has seesawed in recent months, with the
president currently trying to overcome a slight disadvantage in the polls to challenger and current
frontrunner Marina Silva. But polls released this week have shown Rousseff's recovery stalling, which
Eurasia Group says may be the result of her negative campaigning against Silva. "For Rousseff to
remain the favorite, such tightening has to continue to at least a tie--or a slight Rousseff advantage--in
the second round over the next two weeks," Eurasia adds. (paul.kiernan@wsj.com)

17:59 EDT - California's Department of Motor Vehicles issued the first permits this week for testing
autonomous cars on the state's public roads and the process shows how far ahead Google (GOOGL) is
in the race to turn this technology into a commercial product or service. The DMV issued 29 permits at
first and 25 of those went to Google and its fleet of self-driving ToyotaLexus SUVs. The other four went
to Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler AG (DAI.XE), and Volkswagen AG (VOW3.XE), which got two
permits each. (alistair.barr@wsj.com)
17:57 EDT - Asian markets may take a lead from the positive US shares after investors were reassured
by the prospect of low interest rates for awhile longer. In New Zealand, however, "the election is running
things at the moment," says Peter Young, investment advisor at Forsyth Barr. With a general election
slated to take place Saturday in New Zealand "some investors are hedging their bets," he says. He notes
the energy sector, which would be impacted by a change in government, has shed some ground in
recent sessions. The governing National Party is ahead in the polls but will likely have to team up with a
few of the smaller parties to garner enough seats to form a coalition. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com;

17:53 EDT - Alaskans will get a check from their government for $1,884 as a dividend from oil-tax
revenues the state puts into a special fund that invests in stocks, bonds and other assets. More than
640,000 state residents will receive an electronic payment or check starting October 2 for their dividend
from the fund, which is worth more than $51B. The annual dividend has ranged from $331 in 1984 to
$2,069 in 2008, and was $900 in 2013. (cassandra.sweet@wsj.com)

17:50 EDT - Chemicals conglomerate DuPont (DD) traces its roots back to the Thomas Jefferson
administration, and some of its longer-term holders view public pressure from Trian Fund Management
to split the company as a mere blip on the DuPont timeline. Such agitation strikes Robert Gentry,
principal of San Francisco asset manager Stewart & Patten, as "more of a short-term thing" and "not in
the best interests of the shareholders like us who are more long-term oriented." Gentry says his firm has
owned DuPont shares for decades, and while Trian's pitch has yet to move him, he says he does
appreciate the 5% pop in DuPont's share price Wednesday after Trian reveals its campaign.
