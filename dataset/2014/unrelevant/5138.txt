Hong Kong's Longbow Holdings has bought the Octagon in Sydney's Parramatta for about
$83 million.

The asset, at 110 George Street in the heart of the Parramatta central business district, is a
seven-storey office building spread across eight interlinked pods, and was sold on a yield of close to
8.5 per cent.

It was sold by Charter Hall Group's PFA Diversified Property Trust and co-owner Brisbane-based
Westlawn Property Trust. The pair bought the asset in 2007 from Investa Property Group for
$78 million.
Both Charter Hall and Westlawn declined to comment on the sale.
The purchase is Longbow Holdings' second in Australia to date. The Chinese group entered the
market with a $37.9 million play for an office building at 171 Clarence Street in the Sydney CBD
earlier this year.

John McCann and Jon Chomley of Colliers International brokered the deal on behalf of the vendors
while Rick Butler of CBRE negotiated on behalf of Longbow. It was a long-running sales process for
the office property, which was at the cutting edge of office design when completed in 1990.
The Octagon is an A-grade commercial building with a net lettable area of 20,841 square metres
and more than 300 car parks. Its last external valuation was $75 million. Key tenants include Michael
Page and the Police Credit Union.

A-grade stock accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total Parramatta office market and is tightly held.
The vacancy rate in the area is very low at about 0.2 per cent.
