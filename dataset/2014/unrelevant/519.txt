The Karara Project, located 200km east of Geraldton, is a joint venture with Ansteel, one of China’s
largest steel-makers and the country’s biggest iron ore producer.

The project consists of a long-life, magnetite concentrate operation with a smaller-scale supporting
hematite Direct Shipping Ore (‘DSO’) operation.

Production
Karara produced 1.26 million wmt of magnetite concentrate during the September Quarter which is an
increase of 35.5% when compared to the June 2014 Quarter production of 930,000 wmt.

A total of 35 shipments were completed during the September Quarter totalling approximately 2.18
million wmt of combined magnetite concentrate and hematite DSO. Magnetite production quality
averaged 66.2% Fe and 6.9% silica during the Quarter.

As previously advised, some shipments included hematite DSO purchased by KML from third parties to
maximize the use of installed rail and port capacity. During the Quarter, third party hematite DSO
purchases amounted to approximately 1.03 million wmt.

Given the ongoing work to assess and improve the production capacity and performance of the Karara
operation, the Gindalbie Board is not in a position to provide accurate production guidance or forecast
when the Project will achieve positive cash flow. Actual production will continue to be reported on a
quarterly basis.

Remedial Actions and Technical Review

Remedial actions (including upgrade of tailings filters, the temporary wet tailings facility and thickener
optimisation) to enhance capacity of the concentrator circuit, combined with a series of operational
improvements (including feed blending of ore and optimisation of wear liners) to increase throughput of
the crushing circuit, have resulted in a sizable boost in production of magnetite concentrate for the
Quarter (+35.5% above the June 2014 Quarter).

The comprehensive technical review of Karara has continued to assess the design and operation of the
magnetite process plant to maximise plant production. Engineering studies and projects were progressed
during the Quarter and KML will continue to focus on optimising the plant.

Hinge Project

As advised in the June 2014 Quarterly Report, KML proceeded with development of the HIOP after
receiving environmental approval. The HIOP is located 23km north-east of the Karara Project and is
forecast to produce approximately 3.5 million wmt of hematite DSO.

Hematite DSO will be crushed and screened at the HIOP, with material trucked to the existing rail
load-out facility located at Karara. The HIOP is currently being commissioned with first ore expected to be
delivered to the Karara rail head during the December Quarter 2014. During the Quarter KML executed a
contract with MACA Limited for the provision of civil, mining and drill & blast services for the HIOP.

During the September Quarter, environmental and heritage surveys were completed to obtain the
necessary approvals to undertake drilling programs to test several near-mine targets during the
December Quarter 2014.

Funding
During the Quarter, KML executed a binding Facility Agreement with China Development Bank and Bank
of China for a new US$400 million Fixed Term Loan Facility to provide additional working capital.
The date for repayment of KML’s US$130 million term loan facility provided by the Bank of China in
September 2013 was extended by 12 months to September 2015 on similar terms and conditions.
Karara Power Pty Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of KML) completed the sale of the 330kV transmission
line to Western Power. The net sale price was A$82.6 million. KML provided a A$95 million bank
guarantee as security for the long term access rights to the electricity supply network.

GINDALBIE REGIONAL EXPLORATION

Exploration activities during the September Quarter centred on the Windine Well target located
approximately 2.5 kilometres south south-east of the Shine Deposit. Activities included geological
mapping, rock chip sampling, environmental and heritage surveys required to gain the necessary
approvals to undertake a drilling program to test the surface iron-enrichment previously identified.

Work was also undertaken to complete annual statutory technical reporting on tenure, completion of
rehabilitation and environmental and heritage surveys required to undertake focused exploration
programs during 2014-15.

CORPORATE

Financial Report for the Year ended 30 June 2014
Following the completion of a review of the carrying value of the Company’s investment in KML the
Company recorded an impairment loss of A$592.3 million in its annual statutory accounts. The
impairment recognised the lower than forecast production levels at Karara, lower than forecast iron ore
price and higher than anticipated Australian Dollar exchange rate.

Gindalbie released its financial accounts for the year ending 30 June 2014 on 23 September 2014.
