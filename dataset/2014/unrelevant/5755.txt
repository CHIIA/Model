0128 GMT [Dow Jones] Investors should continue to buy shares in PanAust (PNA.AU), even though the
copper-and-gold miner's stock has bounced since it rejected a A$2.30/share offer from China's
Guangdong Rising Assets Management, says UBS analyst Jo Battershill. "In our view, GRAM has been
opportunistic with the timing of its proposal given that its offer price simply covers our net present value
for the existing operations and doesn't ascribe any value for the Frieda River or Inca de Oro assets," he
says. UBS believes the deal with Glencore (GLEN.AU) to buy the Frieda River copper deposit in Papua
New Guinea will be completed in 3Q. At that point, the equity market could begin to include a risk
weighted asset value into the PNA share price. UBS's un-risked valuation is around A$1 billion. UBS
has a A$2.47 price target, above PNA's last trade at A$2.20. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
