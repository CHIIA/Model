CuDeco Ltd. said Oct. 14 that it entered into an agreement with Glencore Plc subsidiary Glencore
International AG for the supply of an initial 20,000 tonnes of primary sulfide ore for toll treatment in the
Ernest Henry mine processing plant, located about 50 kilometers from the company's Rocklands Group
copper project in northwest Queensland.
The trial shipment will evaluate the suitability of Rocklands primary ore for treatment in the processing
plant, and the general handling and processing characteristics in a large-scale processing situation.

Delivery of the ore to the processing site will commence during the current week and the companies may
also consider a long term supply of ore from the Rocklands operations.
Glencore has also agreed to purchase the copper concentrates under an offtake agreement.
In April, CuDeco secured a US$65 million credit facility for its Rocklands Group project from Minsheng
Banking Corp. Ltd. of China, the largest privately owned bank in China.
