Yancoal Australia Ltd. said Nov. 10 that it is undertaking a rights offering of 2.32112 subordinated capital
notes for every 100 of its shares held to raise about US$2.3 billion.
About US$1.8 billion of the proceeds will be used to repay Yancoal's existing senior loans from major
shareholder Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. Ltd., who committed to subscribe for US$1.8 billion of the capital
notes being offered.

The company said the notes will be treated as equity for accounting purposes.
The remaining proceeds will be used to partly fund Yancoal's existing coal operations and future growth.

The distribution rate of the subordinated capital notes will be initially set at 7.00% per annum, but can be
reset to the five-year U.S. dollar midswap rate plus the initial margin per annum every five years for
perpetuity. It is subject to a further 2.50% per annum step up in the 10th year and an incremental 5.00%
per annum step up if a change of control event occurs.

The first distribution payment date is slated in June 2015.
Various terms are conditional upon the offer proceeding. First, the Bank of China and China Construction
Bank will extend the repayment dates of their US$2.6 billion syndicated facility for three years, with the
first repayment under that facility now due until June 2020.
Yanzhou committed to provide up to A$1.4 billion in additional financial support to Yancoal through a
10-year committed funding facility, which will be progressively drawn by Yancoal to fund its cash flow
requirements.

Yanzhou also agreed to provide another 10-year committed funding facility to Yancoal, which it may draw
down, as needed, to pay distributions on the subordinated capital notes for the first five years after the
notes were issued.

Lastly, as long as Yanzhou owns at least 51% of Yancoal, Yanzhou will ensure that Yancoal remains
solvent.

Yancoal expects the offer to close and the subordinated capital notes be issued before Dec. 31.

Deutsche Bank AG's Sydney branch will manage the offer, which will not be underwritten.

The note holders will be able to convert them into shares within 30 years at 10 cents per share if Yancoal
does not redeem the notes.
Parent company Yanzhou Coal Mining recently posted a slide in third-quarter profit due to falling output
at Yancoal Australia.
