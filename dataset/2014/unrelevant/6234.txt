"Support is at 5500, resistance at 5525 and then at 5535... close down 5 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "There were quite big ranges on both the S&P and Dow
last night - the S&P had an 18 point range, the Dow nearly 120 points. With volatility still there it could
cause some sort of correction in the future.
"Gold continued to fall last night. It's broken the $1300 level that previously had provided good support.
The next support is now $1280. The chart there still looks pretty bearish, but it is more than likely to see
some good support at $1280.

"The $A/$US saw a quite interesting move yesterday after the RBA Minutes. That chart is also quite
interesting - for four consecutive days it has tested and closed below the 20 day moving average. There is
not much volatility in the $A at the moment. I would not be surprised to see it head back to 93US c and
possibly break down to 92US c over the coming week. There are early signs of a short term downtrend
there.

Page198of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The German market resumed its downtrend after a bit of a relief rally. It looks a bit precarious now - I
would expect it to test the 9600 level.

"The S&P had quite a volatile night. Intra day it did test the 20 day moving average but found support
there. It also tested the 1180 level which has proven to be resistance in the past. Resistance did not break
but also support held - volatility is increasing there. We would really want to see 1967 hold for the S&P
over coming days.
"Our market started strong but then got sold into. There was a lot of profit taking around the 5530 level.

"What I have noticed is the appetite for shorting banks, especially CBA has increased. It is testing a
triangle formation that is forming on the CBA chart.

"Back to the XJO, 5535 seems to be a level for traders to take profits, but we still had a good close back
above 5500 which is a critical level for us to hold.

"If we break it we could see 5450 pretty quickly.

"For today support is at 5500, resistance at 5525 and then at 5535.
"I will call us down 5 points. We will probably see a bit of a rally early on but it will likely get sold into".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 0.1 to 5511.3 last evening.
