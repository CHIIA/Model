Australia's QGC, a subsidiary of UK-based BG Group, has started up a network of upstream gas
processing facilities which will feed its $20.4 billion Queensland Curtis LNG project off the eastern
Australian port city of Gladstone.

The new facilities will mainly process output from QGC's coalseam gas fields in Queensland's onshore
Surat and Bowen basins.

The seven new facilities comprise six field compression stations feeding gas drawn from hundreds of
CSG wells into the larger Ruby Jo Central processing plant, QGC said Tuesday. The central
processing plant will send the gas to Curtis Island through a 540 km (335 mile) underground pipeline
network.

"This milestone was achieved to schedule and keeps us firmly on track to be the world's first bespoke
project to produce LNG sourced from coal seams, with first LNG production due in the final quarter of
this year," said QGC Managing Director Mitch Ingram.

The new processing facilities are the first to start operating under a contract QGC awarded to
Australian engineering, construction and mining services company Thiess last September for the
construction of 17 field compression stations and four central processing plants at three hubs in the
Surat Basin.
The 8.5 million mt/year Queensland Curtis liquefaction and export facility, being built on Curtis Island
off Gladstone, is targeting first LNG in the fourth quarter of 2014, QGC reiterated.
Under a $1.9 billion deal completed in November 2013 China's state owned China National Offshore
Oil Corporation agreed to increase its equity stake in QCLNG Train 1 to 50% from 10%, to raise its
equity interest in some of BG's Surat Basin reserves and resources from 5% to 25% and the option to
participate as a 25% partner in one of the potential expansion trains at QCLNG.

QCLNG is one of three CSG-based LNG export facilities under construction on Curtis Island, the other
two are led by Australian oil and gas group Santos and US major ConocoPhillips.
Santos is constructing the 7.8 million mt/year two train Gladstone LNG facility. In March the company
said the $18.5 billion project was 80% complete and on track to load its first cargo in 2015. Santos'
partners in GLNG are Malaysia's Petronas (27.5%), French major Total (27.5%) and Korea Gas
Corporation (15%).
ConocoPhillips is building the 9 million mt/year two train Australia Pacific LNG plant, slated for first
output in mid-2015. In late April partner Origin Energy said the A$24.7 billion ($23.3 billion) project
was almost 70% complete. ConocoPhillips and Origin both have 37.5% shares in APLNG with the
remaining 25% held by China's Sinopec.
