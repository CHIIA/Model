2358 GMT [Dow Jones] Upbeat commentary from Cover-More (CVO.AU) bodes well for Flight Centre
(FLT.AU), says Deutsche Bank. At its annual meeting yesterday, Cover-More reported its Australian
travel insurance business has returned to growth after "federal budget related instability" in its fourth
quarter. Cover-More CEO Peter Edwards said sales continued to grow at double-digit rates in the first
quarter with recent currency volatility "not demonstrating any discernible adverse trends". "We believe
that Cover-More's performance should be reasonably well correlated with Flight Centre's booking
volumes," said Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Simotas, noting Flight Centre is Cover-More's largest
distribution partner. "Given Cover-More's heavy reliance on Flight Centre, we take comfort from this
update given it implies that Flight Centre has seen relatively healthy customer volumes," Mr. Simotas
said in a research report. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2318 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY will likely trade in a 106.50-107.50 range in Asia trade, says
Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities. The pair is now at 107.25. The USD was again bought
overnight against the EUR and others, limiting its downside. Japanese importers and others will likely
move to buy the USD for regular settlement for commercial trade, giving support to the USD/JPY. But
investors are staying cautious ahead of the release of the U.S. Treasury's semiannual currency report,
due as early as later Wednesday. The report is sometimes an occasion for the U.S. to scold its
international peers and contains cues for the future of exchange rates. The EUR/USD will likely remain
steady and is tipped in a 1.2600-1.2750 range. It is now at 1.2644. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

2307 GMT [Dow Jones] Nine Entertainment (NEC.AU) enjoyed a strong TV ratings performance in
September, capturing 40.5% of the national audience that month, compared to Seven's (SWM.AU)
38.3% and Ten's (TEN.AU) 21.2%. That's Nine's best ratings performance in the last eight years, says
UBS, which keeps buy recommendation on Nine and Seven, and a sell call on Ten, which is expected on
Thursday to reveal another steep annual loss. The broker still expects a FY15 TV ad market recover to
be weighted to 2H. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2249 GMT [Dow Jones]--J.P. Morgan stays underweight on underwear retailer Pacific Brands (PBG.AU),
and drops its price target to A$0.41 from A$0.49, as the fast-weakening Australian dollar pushes up
import costs and squeezes its margins. Pacific Brands, which also shops shoes and sheets, recently
sold its workwear division, although J.P. Morgan reckons it could have more difficulty selling other assets
as desired due to profit pressures. "We would await a lower share price and/or evidence of Ebit
stabilization before getting more constructive," it says. PBG was last at A$0.445. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
2245 GMT [Dow Jones] Milk price futures, lower volumes on offer and the potential return of Chinese
buyers--who were on holiday at the last auction--"all hint at some price support at this GlobalDairyTrade
auction," says ASB Economist Nathan Penny. Whole milk powder prices fell 10% in the last auction held
Oct. 1 and are down more than 50% since a February peak. The latest GDT auction will take place
overnight Wednesday. New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra has lowered its payout to its farmer
shareholders due to the lower milk price, stripping billions out of the economy. ASB Bank is tipping
Fonterra to pay its 10,500 farmer shareholders NZ$5.30 a kilogram of milk solids in the current season,

line with the latest one given by Fonterra. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

17:07 EDT - North American energy companies have hedged 79% of their aggregate 4Q oil production,
says Citigroup in an analysis of 57 high-yield companies, but just 42% of their output for next year and
17% in 2016. Hedging allows companies to lock in prices ahead of time. If US oil prices average
$80/barrel next year, the companies will make $2.4B on their hedges, Citi says, and they'll make $3.5B if
prices average $75 next year. In comparison, the same 57 companies have hedged 72% of their total
natural-gas production for 4Q, 37% for 2015 and 11% for 2016. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com;

16:53 EDT - A dip in the National Australia Bankbusiness confidence survey in September is still
supporting the NZD/AUD and attempts to move the pair lower have been reversed, says ANZ. Firm says
the main focus is now on Chinese inflation data, with CPI and PPI each expected to moderate. It adds
Chinese credit growth data will also grab attention "given the slowdown in the property market."
NZD/AUD last at 0.8998. ANZ expects the pair to trade in a short-term range of 0.8960 to 0.9040.

16:25 GMT - At the long end of New Zealand yield curve, medium-term risks remained skewed toward
rising yields, says Harbour Asset Management Head of Fixed Interest & Economics Christian Hawkesby.
While the market takes comfort from the U.S. Fed's pledge to keep interest rates near zero, "there is a
danger that long-term interest rates start to pre-empt this move." He adds at the short-end of the NZ yield
curve stability is expected with local economic growth moderating and inflation still well below the target
so it is expected the "the RBNZ has time to reflect and observe the impact of the rise in the OCR to
3.50% and the recent fall in the NZ dollar." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

16:14 EDT - The Canadian dollar appears headed for more weakness, now that the greenback has risen
to the highest level against the loonie since July 2009, and pierced the psychologically important
C$1.1300 resistance level. Traders says that opens up a move for the pair to test C$1.1500. TD
Securities had predicted the pair would get to that level through 1Q 2015, but now says it may come
sooner. "An earlier arrival at that point--and an extension beyond it looks a strong possibility at the
current juncture," TD says. USD/CAD up nearly 1% at 1.1306. (nirmala.menon@wsj.com;

16:04 EDT - Low sugar prices this year and a drop in production in China, the No. 2 sugar consumer
after India, will help fuel an uptick in its imports of the sweetener this year, the USDA says. China's
2014-15 sugar imports will likely reach 3.8M metric tons, 15% higher than the USDA previously forecast.
China may not always get such a sweet deal, though. Raw-sugar futures are up 25% since hitting a 5
1/2-year settlement low of 13.50c/lb last month. (leslie.josephs@wsj.com; @lesliejosephs)

16:01 EDT - The NZD slips overnight, once again taking its cues from its peers, says BNZ Raiko
Shareef. "The NZD has simply traded in line with the AUD over the past 24 hours. The latter has had
mixed fortunes, with some enthusiasm around a bounce in iron ore prices offset by a risk-negative
sentiment globally." NZD/USD last at 0.7833 from 0.7893 late last session. Shareef adds focus is on the
GlobalDairyTrade auction overnight. "Following the last auction's 7.3% fall, another sharp drop would be
an opportunity for NZD bears to re-test the 0.7700 level." Shareef puts initial support at 0.7800 with
resistance at 0.7950. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

14:58 EDT - Now that USD/CAD has broken through year-to-date peak of C$1.1280 and spiked to the
highest level since July 2009, pair is gearing up to test the psychologically important C$1.1300 level.
"The market is going to pay very, very close attention to defending the C$1.13 level," says Bipan Rai,
director of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC World Markets. If that breaks, it would open up the next
key level of C$1.1500, probably in the medium term. The Canadian dollar is taking its cue from the
greenback for now amid lack of domestic data. Canadian inflation data due Friday could be key.
