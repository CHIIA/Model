Cerberus has acquired two portfolios of distressed property loans for £2.3bn as the US private equity
group bets on a strengthened recovery in regional values in the UK and Irish commercial property
markets.
Already one of the biggest buyers of distressed real estate from banks seeking to de-risk their loan
books, Cerberus agreed yesterday to acquire a £1.2bn portfolio of commercial property loans from
National Australia Bank, and a further £1.1bn portfolio of Irish commercial real estate loans from the
Royal Bank of Scotland.

At a time when overseas investors are driving down yields on trophy assets in central London, private
equity groups and hedge funds have become increasingly interested in the long-term recovery
prospects of debt secured on regional property assets , which they perceive as better value.
The RBS portfolio comprises loans on more than 5,000 commercial properties in Ireland. Roughly
three-quarters of the assets are in the Republic of Ireland and a quarter in Northern Ireland - markets
where commercial property values plunged after the financial crisis.
RBS announced the asset sale an hour after it was revealed to have passed stress tests set by the
Bank of England. The Cerberus deal is expected to complete in the first quarter of next year.
RBS said that the carrying value of the property loans was about £1bn, but the value of the gross
assets was close to £4.8bn. The portfolio generated a loss of £800m in the year to December 2013
"primarily in impairment provisions".
The £1.2bn NAB deal builds on a £625m parcel of largely non-performing loans that the bank sold to
Cerberus in July as the bank's new chief executive accelerates its British exit.

NAB, one of Australia's Big Four lenders, has long sought to extract itself from a pre-crisis era
expansion into the UK, where its biggest remaining holdings are the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks -
for which it is examining options that include an initial public offering .

"This is an important step forward, effectively bringing closure to one of our legacy positions," said
Andrew Thorburn , NAB chief executive.
The portfolio consists of mainly defaulted, at-risk or high loan-to-value property loans, the bank said.
The sale leaves NAB with an £836m portfolio of performing loans for which the bank said it would
examine other options.
When completed, yesterday's sale would release £127m of capital, NAB said, adding that it would no
longer report its UK loan portfolio as a separate line of business.

market.
