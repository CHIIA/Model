Trade talks now hinge on Tokyo's high tariffs on imported meat

AGRICULTURE Minister Barnaby Joyce has been quoted by Koya Nishikawa, a senior Japanese
politician, as saying during discussions in Canberra last week about a free trade agreement that
``there is plenty of demand for Australian beef from China''.

Respected Japanese publication The Nikkei Business Daily went on to cite Mr Nishikawa -- who is
head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party's Trans-Pacific Partnership committee -- as being
told by Mr Joyce: ``So if necessary, Australia does not need to go to the trouble of selling it to Japan.''
Beef is the chief sticking point in concluding the FTA. Japan buys $1.5 billion of beef annually from
Australia, making it the industry's biggest customer. But the 38.5 per cent tariff means the industry is
also paying the Japanese government $590 million a year.

The Japanese report said Mr Nishikawa was ``thrown by Mr Joyce's response''.

Mr Joyce responded that he ``made clear to Mr Nishikawa Australia's concerns'' if Japan were unable
to make ``a significant market access offer to Australia on beef and dairy''.

The report also noted that Mr Nishikawa met Tony Abbott and two cabinet ministers, and ``he
received an unusually cordial welcome for an LDP parliamentarian who is not a cabinet minister''.

The other minister he met was Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb, about whom the Nikkei
said: ``In the closing stages of the discussion, (he) said he `understood Japan's situation' and
indicated that he would not seek to have Japan scrap its beef tariff entirely, as South Korea has
agreed to do'' in its recently concluded FTA with Australia.

Mr Robb described that report as highly speculative. He said: ``In regard to beef we are striving for
full liberalisation, but there's a long way to go. We are aiming to be the first major agricultural
exporter to conclude an FTA with Japan and it is a tough negotiation but we are making good
progress.''

Agricultural liberalisation in Japan historically has been met with strong resistance from powerful
lobbies in the country and Japan has not liberalised key products including beef and pork, wheat,
dairy, sugar or rice in any previous trade agreements.

The report said that ``among those close to the Japan-Australia negotiations the view is growing that
the final battle will be fought at 20 per cent tariff levels''.

Mr Robb is flying to Japan next Wednesday to meet Agriculture Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and
others.

Early next month Mr Abbott will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.
