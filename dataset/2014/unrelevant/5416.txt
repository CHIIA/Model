GOODMAN Group has struck one of Australia’s largest residential site deals with an agreement
pending for the sale of its holdings in Sydney’s Ashmore Precinct urban renewal area.
The industrial property powerhouse has secured a purchaser for the business park in Erskineville
for a price estimated at more than $350 million.

The group holds industrial parks that have the potential to be converted into more than 35,000 unit
blocks in strategic inner-city locations across Australia and has been selling since last year.
Given the scale of the anticipated transaction, it is likely an offshore group will be involved. But a
group that has done business with Goodman — China’s Country Garden, which bought a park in
North Ryde for an apartment project — has distanced itself from any transaction.

Michael Crombie of Colliers International is rumoured to be brokering the deal but was uncontactable.
Goodman last night declined to comment on the site. Last month the company said it had $500m of
urban renewal sites on the market, under due diligence or sold in Australia and Britain.
Goodman chief executive Greg Goodman last week confirmed the group’s strategy to sell sites to
residential developers rather than undertaking projects itself. With the residential property boom in
Sydney’s inner west boosting the value of Goodman’s holdings in Erskineville, the looming deal is
expected to be struck at a multiple of the site’s value as an industrial park.
The site, which includes 57 Ashmore Street and 165-175 Mitchell Road, Erskineville, has its own
planning controls.

The properties span about 7ha of the 17ha Ashmore Precinct. The precinct is expected to produce
about 3300 homes when fully redeveloped and the Goodman properties are to hold about 1765
dwellings.
CLSA analysts expressed confidence in the group’s sales strategies after a tour of Goodman’s
Sydney and Melbourne assets last month. “We now expect up to $2 billion in assets sales in fiscal
2015 and Goodman Group ’s residential conversions to deliver up to $247m profits in fiscal 2015,”
CLSA analyst Sholto Maconochie said.

He saw the potential for a special dividend of up to 14c per share and CLSA estimated value creation
of about 50c per share.
Goodman has already sold two sites for 3.6 times book value and CLSA expects the industrial
property group to sell its next six active sites for between two to three times book value, realising
$587m to $1bn in net proceeds.CLSA sees immediate benefit this year from the sale of Epping,
Erskineville and Alexandria sites in NSW, with significant value to come from 9917 units in Port
Melbourne in fiscal years 2018-2020.
