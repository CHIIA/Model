A Chinese developer fought off fierce local and international competition to buy 110-112 Franklin
Street, Melbourne, for $8 million, exceeding expectations.
"At $17,000 per square metre of land, this is a record sale for under 500 square metres," said Josh
Rutman from CBRE Melbourne city sales.

The vendors were a private Malaysian family. Mr Rutman, Ed Wright and Mark Wizel at CBRE
Melbourne brokered the deal. It attracted 12 offers and seven unconditional contracts. It began with
a public expression of interest. The contract was executed on June 3, with a 60-day settlement.

The building, in the Melbourne central business district, has been approved for development of a
boutique hotel with height restrictions of 15 levels. The restrictions did not deter more than 160
interested buyers.
The property occupies 467 square metres of land and the building itself is 621 square metres.
Sunshine is the new resting place for Chin Baptist Church. which has purchased an older,
industrial building with adjoining land in Melbourne's west for $2.16 million in a private sale.
The church will convert the 2300- square-metre building on the 6000-square-metre property into a
new church and parking lot.

The building previously operated as a timber mill.

Knight Frank's Joel Davy handled the deal at 11-15 Hampton Avenue.
Sydney's lower north shore property aficionados continued to scoop up top spots in the area last
week.
Naremburn's 284A Willoughby Street sold for $1.21 million and Crows Nest 1 and 2 at 29 Albany
Street exchanged hands for $990,000.
A retail and commercial site in Naremburn was sold to a private investor in a private sale. At 216
square metres, the property will attract annual rent of $48,000 plus goods and services tax. The
property is close to the shopping strip and has parking for up to six cars.

Scott Stephens and Amy Pfeiffer from LJ Hooker brokered the deal.
Crows Nest's Albany Street is a 241-square-metre retail property which was previously vacant. B &
H Property Group sold it to a private investor.
Currently a double-storey building with parking, the property has been approved for development
into 11 apartments and a retail site with construction scheduled to be completed in October 2014.

Dacre Street, Mitchell for $1.16 million from Paton Enterprises.

warehouse for machinery storage and the office space as its headquarters.
The units are new and were purchased off the plan.
A piece of industrial land close to the M5 and M7 in Smeaton Grange, Sydney sold for
$3.64 million.
Neville's Bus Service bought the freehold land from Investa Commercial Developments off market
in a deal handled by Colliers International's Fab Dalfonso and Adrian Balderston.
The 28,030-square-metre land property at Lot 431 Bluett Drive, has a capital value of $130 a
square metre.
