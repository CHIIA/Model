MARKETS FALL -LOWER $US ERODES PRICE RISE ADVANTAGE

Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 9 points to 4.23%. The $A is at 90.36US c, up about 40 points on
Saturday levels. While some MISCI markets rose, including South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia,
Australia was down, China physical and the Hang Seng fell and US market futures were weaker with the
surprising low December numbers a dampener on the US recovery story.
Our $A rose sharply while the banks fell and resources were mixed. Volume was very light at $2.5 billion.

Investors however are listening to reports, and activity is across the board rather than being confined to
the Top 10 stocks (CBA, BHP, WBC, ANZ, RIO, WOW, QBE, WPL, CSL and MQG) that were nearly the
whole of the market for at least half of calendar 2013.

*Western Areas rose 21c to $2.56 on 1.5m shares on the higher nickel price.

*Newcrest recovered 51c to 48.87 on 4.1m shares while Oceana, Perseus, Silverlake and others were
also higher.

*Perseus recovered 3.5c to 33c on 12.45m shares.

*Buxton rose 14c to 35c on 4.17m shares on reporting the highest graphite find, up to 32.6% graphite at
Yalbra graphite project, WA in Australia.

points to 2012.14, Hang Seng futures was down 57 points to 22,806 points, S&P futures was down 4.6
