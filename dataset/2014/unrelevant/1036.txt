Market Update

The Dow Jones-UBS Commodities Index (Index) posted strong gains for the month of February, returning
4.1% in AUD terms.

Agricultural commodities was the best performing sector, up 9.3% in AUD terms. The sector was boosted
by the performance of coffee and soybeans, which returned 40.9% and 8.2%, respectively, as droughts in
Brazil continued to cause supply-side pressure. Similarly, lean hogs posted impressive figures for the
month, with prices climbing 21.6% on the back of a US swine disease outbreak.

Precious metals also performed well during February, closing the month up 5.5% in AUD terms. This was
led by rallies in silver (+8.8%) and gold (+4.6%) as investors continued to seek safe haven plays with
continued volatility in emerging markets. Platinum was also up for the period (+3.2%) amid sustained
mining union strikes in South Africa.
Overall, energy commodities were flat in February, returning 0.5% on an aggregated basis. However, at
the individual commodity level, returns varied greatly. Gasoline (+4.2%) and WTI crude oil (+3.2%) were
both up as low stockpile data was released in the US, while natural gas (-8.5%) and heating oil (-7.6%)
dropped significantly as investors speculated demand for heating fuels would fall as warmer weather was
forecast for North America.

Industrial metals was the worst performing sector for the month, closing down 0.1% in AUD terms. While
tin (+4.8%), zinc (+4.2%) and nickel (+3.5%) were all up for the period, sector performance was

month low as slowing Chinese growth is causing short-term demand pressures.
In the equities space, materials equities and energy equities were up 4.3% and 4.1%, respectively, in
AUD terms over the month.
