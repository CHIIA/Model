FLOATS: Pacific Equity Partners and its bankers have decided to allocate about $200 million, or up
to 20 per cent of the Spotless initial public offering, to individual investors in Australia and New
Zealand after the closing of the Spotless retail broker offer.

Spotless, an outsourced facilities specialist, its financial adviser Highbury Partnership and buyout
firmPacific Equity Partners decided on the allocation to retail investors yesterday, after receiving
feedback from the IPO’s joint lead managers Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS as well as co-lead
manager Evans & Partners.

Spotless plans to raise between $864.9m and $1 billion in its IPO and the bankers and company
are confident it will be at the upper end of that range, following the response from retail investors to
the offering and initial feedback from fund managers.

Later this week Spotless management and its bankers will travel to New York and then London,
Singapore and Hong Kong to assess demand and garner orders from fund managers for the IPO.
Between 106 million and 162 million shares will be sold in the IPO at between $1.60 and $1.85 a
share, or 15.8-17.6 times 2014 forecast net profit, according to the Spotless prospectus.The
company’s net debt is $617.6m.
