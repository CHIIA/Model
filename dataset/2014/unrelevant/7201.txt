AAPMEDIA RELEASE PR56696 Heraeus Plans Resurgence After Two Slow Financial Years

HANAU, Germany, May 8, 2014/PRNewswire-AsiaNet/--

The Hanau-based Heraeus precious metals and technology group finished financial year 2013 with
satisfactory results despite some lower numbers. This was announced by the Heraeus Holding GmbH
Board of Management at a press conference on annual results held in Frankfurt on May 8. The slowing
pace of growth in China - an important market for Heraeus - combined with continued market uncertainty
in Europe and the United States as well as lower precious metals prices to depress revenue and earnings
for the Heraeus Group again this past year. Heraeus had total product revenue of EUR3.6 billion (10
percent less than in 2012). However, this outcome was greatly influenced by precious metals price
effects. Adjusted for these effects, revenues for 2013 show a slight increase, up by 2 percent over the
previous year. Weak industrial demand for platinum, gold and silver pulled precious metals trading
revenue down to EUR13.5 billion (-16 percent).
Operating results (EBIT) fell by 29 percent, ending at EUR256 million. This was mainly attributable to
continued stagnation in the photovoltaics market, one-time effects of restructuring measures, and
expenditures for the IT-based Magellan process harmonization program. By contrast, the annual result for
the Heraeus Group was distinctly positive, at EUR454 million (+92 percent over 2012). This increase
reflects proceeds from the sale of the Heraeus Dental business group during the past financial year.

"Heraeus was not entirely immune to the fairly restrained macroeconomic environment of the past year,
although the significant declines in product revenue and operating results are largely attributable to lower
precious metals prices and one-time effects," said Jan Rinnert, chairman of the Heraeus Holding GmbH
Board of Management in summary. "Given this background, we feel a certain level of satisfaction with
financial year 2013, but we are planning on significant growth in the future."

Outlook

Overall, the Heraeus Group is on target for the current year. The first-quarter results reflect this, with
some business groups off to a strong start for 2014 while others remain rather restrained. There is every
likelihood that the uncertain overall economic situation the Heraeus Group navigated in 2013 will continue
in the current fiscal year.

"On the whole, however, we expect improvement in the operating results for 2014. The Heraeus Group is
currently implementing numerous initiatives and measures to enhance efficiency and improve margins,
giving reason for optimism. The associated costs were already included in the results for 2013," said Jan
Rinnert.
