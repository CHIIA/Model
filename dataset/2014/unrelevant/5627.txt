BC Iron bids for Stokes ore venture Resources $250 million deal looms

A looming $250 million deal could see billionaireKerry Stokes' entrench his position in the lucrative
Australian iron ore sector. Mr Stokes' $80 million stake in ASX-listed Iron Ore Holdings could become a
$112 million stake in established exporter BC Iron under the terms of a takeover bid revealed on
Monday. BC has lobbed a cash and scrip offer to IOH that already has the blessing of the IOH board and
Mr Stokes, who is a 52percent owner. It is the second takeover bid to strike the Australian iron ore sector
in the space of three months after Baosteel and Aurizon acquired Aquila Resources in July. IOH
shareholders have been offered 10ï¿½ in cash, and 0.44 BC shares for every IOH share they own,
meaning the deal would deliver about $8.5million in cash to Mr Stokes, plus about $112million of BC
shares, based on the latter's closing share price on Monday. Significantly, Mr Stokes will become the
biggest shareholder in the enlarged BC, with 19percent, if the takeover wins approval from at least
90percent of IOH shareholders. IOH director Ryan Stokes said he was proud of what the company had
achieved. "We look forward to participating in the growth of BC Iron in coming years," he said. BC exports
about 4.3million tonnes per year through its Nullagine joint venture with Fortescue Metals Group, and
while that partnership has turned the company into a dividend-paying market darling, the joint venture
has only six years of mine life remaining. The
acquisition of IOH could extend that mine life by 15 years, if IOH's two assets can be successfully
brought into production. BC managing director Morgan Ball said IOH's $800million Buckland Hills project,
with its proposed port facility at Cape Preston, was a strategic part of the acquisition."As a merged
company, we will sit down and look at all our options in relation to developing Buckland, both from a
development perspective and a funding perspective." The combined entity could yet have relevance to
Chinese steel maker Baosteel and rail provider Aurizon, who jointly acquired iron ore assets close to
Buckland Hills in the recent $1.42 billion acquisition of Aquila Resources. Baosteel and Aurizon are
planning to spend more than $4 billion on a railway and a new port at Anketell. Macquarie analyst
Hayden Bairstow said it could make sense for the enlarged BC to co-operate with Baosteel rather than
build its own infrastructure. "Why would BC Iron develop a barging facility there if someone else is going
to build a greenfields port," he said. The Buckland Hills project is expected to cost about $800 million to
build if BC decides to develop its own transport infrastructure, and Mr Bairstow said that sort of outlay
may not appeal to investors who bought BC shares for dividends.BC shares closed 32ï¿½ lower at $2.99,
while IOH shares rose to their highest price in 27 months, with the stock closing 37.5ï¿½ higher at
$1.325.
