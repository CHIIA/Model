JUDGMENTS

South Australia

TD

16 December 2013 - RE H, AE (No 3) [2013] SASC 196

In 2011, spermatozoa was removed from the applicant's late husband (Re H, AE). In 2012, the Court
concluded the applicant had established a case for the release of the spermatozoa for In Vitro Fertilisation
(IVF) treatment (Re H, AE (No 2)) but before an order could be made, consent should be sought from the
Attorney-General for an exemption under the Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act 1988 (SA). The
Attorney-General advised he did not have power to enable assisted reproductive treatment in the manner
sought, and such treatment would be inconsistent with the policy requirement that a person provide
consent for the use of their gametes prior to death.

Unlike South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) does not have legislation regulating the
provision of assisted productive technology, and the applicant located a clinic in Canberra to perform IVF.
In the ACT, the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee of the Fertility Society of Australia
requires compliance with the National Health and Medical Research Council's Ethical Guidelines on the
Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research 2007. The Guidelines state
"Clinics must not facilitate use of gametes to achieve pregnancy ... unless ... a deceased person has left
clearly expressed and witnessed directions consenting to the use of his or her gametes". While Judge
Gray was satisfied the applicant had produced sufficient evidence that the deceased wished to have a
family with her, it was up to the clinic to make its own determination.

Judge Gray granted the applicant use of the spermatozoa, under the control and supervision of the
Canberra clinic.

New South Wales

23 December 2013 - Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) v Shashank Verma [2013] NSWPYT 2

The Commission alleged that Mr Verma, a registered physiotherapist, failed to maintain proper
professional boundaries with a widowed and childless elderly nursing home patient, by engaging in a
personal and financial relationship with her while providing her with treatment.

The Physiotherapists Tribunal found that by allowing a personal relationship to develop between his
patient and his family members, Mr Verma had not failed to maintain proper professional boundaries, as
such boundaries did not extend to his family members. It was also found that Mr Verma being named as
executor and beneficiary of the patient's was not a breach of professional boundaries, as he was not
aware of this until shortly before her death.
What did cross professional boundaries and violate the Physiotherapist Registration Board Code of
Conduct was Mr Verma's appointment as the patient's Enduring Guardian and Power of Attorney and
agreeing to hold significant sums of money which the patient asked him to safeguard, while still
maintaining a professional relationship by treating her.

Page58of297©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The Tribunal agreed that Mr Verma and his family had not engaged in deliberate exploitation of the patient
in allowing the personal relationship. He was therefore found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct,
not professional misconduct. "This is a case where acts of kindness by a health practitioner's family
towards an elderly patient...can amount to a breach of proper professional boundaries."

Mr Verma was reprimanded and his practice subject to conditions, such as him completing an Ethics
Course to the satisfaction of the Physiotherapy Council of NSW.
