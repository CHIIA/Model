Australian oil and gas company ROC Oil has received a takeover offer from a third party, potentially
thwarting its proposed A$800 million ($752 million) "merger of equals" with Horizon Oil.
The proposal for the acquisition of all of ROC's shares, was "confidential, unsolicited and incomplete,"
the company said in a statement Wednesday.

"Shareholders do not need to take any action in response to the proposal," ROC said. "There is no
certainty that the proposal will develop into a formal offer to ROC's shareholders."

Horizon said it had made no recommendation to its shareholders in relation to the proposal. "The board
of Horizon Oil remains committed to the merger with ROC Oil," the company said in a separate
statement.

Under the terms of the merger, agreed by the two companies on April 29, Horizon shareholders would
receive 0.724 of a share in ROC, which would retain its identity as the operator of the expanded group's
assets in Malaysia, China and PNG. ROC's existing shareholders would hold around 42% of the
merged company, with Horizon shareholders owning about 58%.

The proposal has been opposed by ROC's largest shareholder, Allan Gray. The funds management
company has called an extraordinary general meeting for July 11 at which it will put a resolution to
change ROC's constitution and frustrate the merger.
ROC and Horizon are partners in an oil field which is currently producing around 13,000 b/d in China's
Beibu Gulf.
The expanded company's key growth asset in Malaysia would be its 50% stake in Petronas Carigali's
D35, D21 and J4 oil fields, offshore Sarawak. The fields, currently producing 10,000 b/d of oil and
17,000 Mcf/d of gas, are to be redeveloped at a cost of $250 million.

Horizon's major contribution to the merged group would be its 30%-held Stanley and 27%-held
Elevala/Ketu projects in PNG. A $300 million development of the Stanley field has been approved by
the PNG government and is expected to be completed in 2016, producing 4,000 b/d of condensate and
140,000 Mcf/day of gas. In the longer term, Horizon's PNG assets are expected to form the basis of a
mid-scale LNG project.
