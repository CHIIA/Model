In the last six months, BG Group PLC has gone from darling of the oil and gas sector to candidate for a
breakup and, some suggest, a possible takeover.
While shares in rival European energy companies like BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA
have all risen healthily this year, BG's have stagnated following a litany of misfortune.

In April, Chief Executive Chris Finlayson resigned after just 16 months in the job--leaving Chairman
Andrew Gould in charge and searching for a successor. In January it took a combined $2.4 billion
write-down on troubled gas assets in the U.S. and Egypt.

Once renowned for rapid growth, BG said in January that its output won't rise in 2014, the third time the
company has cut its production forecasts since October 2012.

Now Mr. Finlayson's departure has reignited speculation over the future of BG, long seen as a potential
takeover target. Its shares have fallen around 25% from their peak in April 2011--although the company
is still worth nearly $70 billion.
Near-term, a significant pruning of BG's assets is on the cards, a process likely to excite both major oil
companies and state-owned oil companies. BG's highly-prized oil assets off the coast of Brazil, its large
stake in an Australian liquefied natural gas project and gas discoveries in Tanzania could be among
those on the block.

"There are no sacred cows in the portfolio--we will look at everything," Mr. Gould said recently. Mr. Gould
will provide the next company update on July 31 when BG presents its first-half results.

Under former chief executive Sir Frank Chapman, in charge from 2000 until he retired in late 2012, BG
experienced years of strong growth, and inflated expectations.
Through successful exploration and acquisition, the company more than tripled its output in a decade
from 1997, reaching 601,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2006. Mr. Chapman predicted the
company would produce 1 million boe/day by 2015. BG's promise of quick expansion helped it trade at
a significant premium compared with peers Shell and BP, based on multiples of expected earnings.

But growing pains hit BG even before Mr. Chapman departed.

In October 2012 it slashed near-term production forecasts, chiefly because of problems at its gas fields in
Egypt and low U.S. natural gas prices that had made it unprofitable to produce there. Earlier that year, it
said investment in a project to produce gas in Queensland, Australia and liquefy it for export had run
36% over budget, costing an additional $5.4 billion.

Stories meanwhile emerged of Mr. Chapman's autocratic management style.

Mr. Chapman couldn't be reached for comment.
After taking over in January 2013, Mr. Finlayson scrapped the 1 million boe/day target for 2015.

than back in 2006. Output could dip below 600,000 boe/day this year, according to the company,
roughly a quarter of oil major Exxon Mobil Corp's annual production.

Mr. Finlayson also fell foul of Mr. Gould's desire for a more rapid action on BG's assets. Although
disposals worth $4.8 billion were closed in 2013, the majority were under way before Mr. Finlayson took
over.
BG's most valuable oil assets lie 186 miles off the Brazilian coast beneath a layer of salt in the Santos
basin. The reservoir's high productivity requires less drilling and fewer wells, making barrels produced
there among the industry's most profitable, according to analysts.
BG hopes to produce 500,000 boe/day net to the company from Santos by 2020, up from 57,000
boe/day currently. The Brazilian assets could be worth around $36 billion according to financial research
firm Sanford C. Bernstein.
Any buyer in BG's stake would have to get along with Brazil's state-owned oil company Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, the operator in all the blocks where BG has an interest.

"Brazil is...still one of the most interesting regions geologically and remains interesting for a number of
parties," said a person familiar with the matter.
Still, with BP, Shell and other oil majors also shedding assets the market is tough for sellers. And with
Chinese buyers stepping back as they digest recent acquisitions, BG could find speedy asset sales
challenging, bankers say.

Elsewhere BG has stakes in big gas deposits off Tanzania in East Africa, with estimated gross resources
there of 15 trillion cubic feet.
Some investors and analysts think BG should reduce its unusually high 74% stake in the Queensland
Curtis gas project, which is due to start up in the fourth quarter. Typically in the oil and gas sector,
operators hold a 35%-50% stake in projects they run. Mr. Finlayson said in February the company was
considering selling pipeline and water treatment plants connected with the project, assets that could be
worth $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion and might appeal to infrastructure funds.

BG declined to comment for this article.

Selling some assets could reassure investors that BG is worth more than its current market
capitalization. It currently trades at a 34% discount to its net asset value, based on Deutsche Bank
estimates.

Still, the higher BG's market value, the more difficult it could become for any potential suitor.
"The only company that could realistically buy BG is Exxon Mobil--it would be a stretch for Chevron and
a big leap for a Chinese oil company, " said a second person familiar with the matter.
