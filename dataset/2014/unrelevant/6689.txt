ROC SYDNEY, April 29 AAP - Energy companies Roc Oil and Horizon have announced plans to
merge in a deal worth around $800 million.

The two companies on Tuesday announced they had entered in to a merger implementation deed that
would see investors trade their Horizon shares for shares in Roc Oil.

The merged company is expected to have a market capitalisation of around $800 million, with assets
across China, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand.
Horizon chairman Fraser Ainsworth said the merger, which has the support of both company's boards,
would deliver better returns to shareholders.
"The merger allows all shareholders to retain exposure to the attractive assets of each company, whilst
providing greater diversification, scale and a stronger platform from which to continue to deliver future
shareholder returns," he said.

Shares in both companies were placed in a trading halt ahead of the announcement and will resume
trading at 1100 AEST.
