ASX-listed Xanadu Mines Ltd today announced that it, and its joint venture company Mongol Metals LLC,
have completed the acquisition of a 90% interest in Oyut Ulaan LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of
Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. Oyut Ulaan LLC owns 100% of the Kharmagtai porphyry copper-gold
exploration project located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. Minter Ellison acted as legal counsel to
Xanadu Mines, with an advisory team led by Elisabeth Ellis, with Sebastian Rosholt and Dunnaran
Baasankhuu in Ulaanbaatar and Bruce Cowley, Simon Scott and Jordan Phillips in Brisbane (Australia).
Commenting on the transaction, Ms. Ellis said the acquisition marks a significant milestone in Xanadu s
Mongolian strategy and is good news for Mongolia, which is seeking to encourage direct foreign investors
back to the country.

"The team on the ground in Mongolia drew on our firm's specialist mining expertise and worked closely
with our colleagues in Brisbane to bring the transaction to a successful conclusion. Mongolia offers
enormous opportunities for private sector investment, not only in natural resources but also in
infrastructure development and in associated services industries. This deal is a good and positive sign for
renewed growth in this market, " Ms Ellis said. In November 2013, the Mongolian Government passed its
new Investment Law, which repealed previous legislation that required approval for foreign investment by
private companies. Earlier this year, the Government also adopted a new Minerals Law Policy, which is
designed to establish a stable investment environment and strengthen the competitiveness of the
Mongolian mining sector on the international market. The US$14 million acquisition is being funded by
Xanadu with a US$4.0 million, 3-year loan agreement with the Noble Group and US$4.0 million equity
in Mongol Metals from its joint venture partner as initial consideration. Xanadu Mines Ltd is an ASX listed
mineral company that has assembled a significant exploration portfolio across Mongolia s porphyry belts.
Kharmagtai is one of the most advanced, undeveloped copper projects in Mongolia and places Xanadu
and Mongol Metals at the forefront of unlocking Mongolia s copper potential.
