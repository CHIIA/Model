It was a public book autograph session taken place in Central, the most favourite place on earth for Mr Ho,
who has taken some of the most iconic photographs of Hong Kong in 1950s and 1960s, in his
homecoming trip. The event attracted 100 of Mr Ho's supporters, many having the first chance to meet
The Great Master in the flesh.
Mr Ho's trip marks the worldwide release of "A Hong Kong Memoir", and the reprint of his two previous
publications, "Hong Kong Yesterday" and "The Living Theatre", which had both been out of print and
sought after by fans in the past few years.
All three publications, in a special edition for The Pottinger Hong Kong, are now available at HK$690
each.

Mr. Ho, now aged 83, has received over 280 photography awards in his long career. Between 1958 and
1965, he was eight times named one of the Top Ten Photographers of the World by the Photographic
Society of America. His style of photography has also earned him the nickname of 'The Great Master' and
'Henri Cartier-Bresson of Asia'.
The Pottinger Hong Kong, under Sino Group of Hotels and winner of Asia's Best City Boutique Hotel
Award at World Boutique Hotel Awards 2014, collaborates with Mr Ho to have 10 of his masterpieces that
depict the heritage of Hong Kong showcased at about 70 locations in the hotel.

The collaboration becomes fruitful after a 6-month discussion with Mr. Ho, who now resides in California,
USA, and it is the biggest scale commercial project that Mr. Ho has ever agreed to participate in.
"Central Hong Kong is my most favourite place on earth. When Sino approached me and explained to me
patiently that they hope to celebrate the heritage of Hong Kong through my photographs in The Pottinger
Hong Kong, I realised that we have similar goals," says Mr. Ho. "I am very happy to be here at The
Pottinger Hong Kong and see that they have used my photos in most of the rooms and at the restaurant."
