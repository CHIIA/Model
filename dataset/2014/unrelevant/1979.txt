Investment bank UBS has been hired to sell the Lady Annie copper mine, owned by CST Mining
and located near Mount Isa in northern Queensland.
Copper prices have been falling, so it might not be the most opportune time for a sale. However,
Lady Annie, which produces about 25,000 tonnes of copper cathode per year, has been dogged by
environmental issues, while CST is understood to be keen to put its money into other projects.

The process is being run out of Hong Kong and, it should be noted, it is still early days. Lady Annie,
which some argue is worth as much as $130 million, is certainly too small for a large-scale player
and may instead appeal to the mid-tier miners.

That said, the project is unlikely to fit with PanAust's strategy, while Sandfire Resources already has
a much higher-quality project in its DeGrussa copper mine.
In terms of Chinese buyers, Jiangxi Copper, Zijin Mining Group and Zhaojin Mining will likely take
a look.
Lady Annie could also garner interest from private equity groups such as Pacific Road Capital and
Resource Capital Funds.
CST Mining also owns a 16.5 per cent stake in Hong Kong-listed G-Resources Group.
