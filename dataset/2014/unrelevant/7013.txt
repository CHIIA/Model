Bangladesh, Sept. 24 -- London has overtaken Hong Kong as the world's most expensive city to live
and work in, with a new study suggesting it is almost twice as pricey as Sydney, and four times more
than Rio de Janeiro, according to report published at theguardian.com
The estate agent Savills said the combined typical cost of renting somewhere to live and leasing an
office to work for a year in London had risen to almost &#163;74,000 per employee. That puts the UK
capital well ahead of other global hubs such as New York, Paris and Tokyo.

London's rise to first place in the rankings was blamed on big increases in office rents, plus the pound's
strength against the dollar, prompting Savills to warn that it risks becoming less competitive as a result.
By contrast, falling residential rents and a weakening currency contributed to Hong Kong, which had
previously topped the ranking five years running, dropping to second place.

Savills' 12 Cities report is designed to help companies assess the costs of relocating employees. It
measures the total cost per employee in US dollars of renting living and working space in some of the
world's global hubs. The calculations are based on the cost of two seven-strong staff teams that are
representative of start-up businesses, one based in a "prime financial sector location" and the other in a
slightly less prime or creative area, in order to give a representative figure.
The annual cost per employee in London was put at $120,568 (&#163;73,800), with Hong Kong close
behind at $115,717. New York and Paris were in third and fourth place, at $107,782 and $105,550
respectively. Sydney came eighth at $63,630, Shanghai tenth at $43,171 and Rio eleventh at $32,179.
Mumbai was bottom of the table at $29,742.

"Despite its climb in the rankings from fifth to first place since 2008, London is still a way off the
live/work accommodation costs record, set by Hong Kong in 2011 at $128,000 a year," Savills said,
adding that Hong Kong was still "by far the most expensive city" in which to buy a home, with prices
40% higher than London - although the gap was narrowing.

"Comparatively affordable" Rio and Sydney had seen significant increases in live/work costs since 2008
- up 85% and 58% respectively - but Savills said Rio still looked "highly competitive".
Yolande Barnes, the company's director of world research, said: "This year has seen much more
modest real estate price growth in nearly all our world cities, and some have shown small falls. We
expect this subdued trend to continue as investor interest and market activity shifts to second-tier cities.
