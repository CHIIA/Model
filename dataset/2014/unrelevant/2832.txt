SHANGHAI--China's Bright Food Group Co. is hungry for international deals.

Bright Food, which bought Weetabix Food Co. two years ago, is planning to list the U.K.
breakfast-cereal maker in Hong Kong or London, said Ge Junjie, Bright's vice president, in a news
briefing Thursday. The company is also planning a listing of Manassen Foods Australia Pty. Ltd., but
has no time frame Mr. Ge said.

The Shanghai-based company, which is known for its White Rabbit candy, is also "in discussion" with
Irish dairy-products groupGlanbia PLC, Mr. Ge said. He declined to offer more details.
He said Bright is looking for dairy, sugar and wine deals across the globe, in places including Australia,
North America and New Zealand.
Bright Food is an example of a Chinese company that is looking overseas to secure resources for the
Chinese market. It has opened its wallet in the past few years for a string of outbound acquisitions.
In addition to Weetabix, Bright acquired in October a majority stake in Italian olive oil maker Salov
Group for an undisclosed amount.
Also in October, it extended a deadline to acquire a 56% stake in Israeli dairy companyTnuva Food
Industries Ltd. to Jan. 5, its second three-month extension of a billion-dollar transaction that was
expected to close two months ago. Bright Food hasn't disclosed how much it is paying for the Tnuva
stake, but people familiar with the matter said earlier the transaction valued Tnuva at around $2.4
billion.
In 2011, Bright acquired a 75% stake in Australia-focused Manassen Foods Australia Pty. Ltd. from
Champ Private Equity. Bright has said it is planning to launch a financial arm for its overseas mergers
and acquisitions and to bring together capital for the entire company.

Mr. Ge said that Bright plans to raise 20% to 30% of market valuation for Weetabix and Manassen. He
declined to offer valuation and financial details.
With the expansion of China's economy, Bright--which also sells products such as pork and ice
cream--expects a higher demand for food in the country, the company said. Bright, which is known for
its dairy and its White Rabbit candy, also plans to expand its retail division, including Hao De
convenience stores and Nong Gong Shang supermarkets.
