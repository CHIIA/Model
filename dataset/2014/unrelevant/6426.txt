GOODMAN Fielder has confirmed it has received a sweetened takeover bid from its Asian suitors
that values the breads and spreads maker at $1.37 billion.

The group, which owns brands including Helga’s, MeadowLea, Vogel’s and Olive Grove, has told the
market it is considering the new bid, which was tabled on Thursday.

Goodman, which also makes and sells biscuits, sauces and oil, last month rejected a $1.27 billion
takeover offer from Singapore-based agribusiness Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment
firm First Pacific Company.

The two suitors have now increased their offer, from 65¢ for each Goodman share to 70¢. They have
said they will offer no more.

Wilmar and First Pacific also said they would pull their offer if the Goodman board had not thrown its
support by getting behind the bid by last night and opened their books for due diligence.

The support of two of Goodman Fielder’s major shareholders has already been secured by the Asian
firms, with Perpetual and Ellerston Capital to sell their combined 4.8 per cent of stock in Goodman if
the board accepts the offer.
First Pacific holds a 10.1 per cent stake in Goodman.Goodman shares slipped yesterday afternoon
after they emerged from a trading halt, closing down 1.04 per cent at 66¢.
