ADM Profit Falls on Charges, Slow Corn Selling -- Update

Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings fell 27% on charges related to its blocked purchase
of GrainCorp Ltd., while farmers' reluctance to sell corn at cheap prices hit ADM's grain-trading revenue.

A record U.S. corn harvest last autumn prompted farmers to store corn rather than to sell it at sharply
lower prices, pushing ADM's grain-trading profits down by one-third in the quarter, the company reported
Tuesday. Many U.S. farmers have increased grain-storage capacity in recent years, giving them more
flexibility around when to sell corn.

"Our ag services business was impacted by the slow U.S. farmer selling of corn and challenges in our
international merchandising," ADM Chief Executive Patricia Woertz said on a post-earnings conference
call.

On a positive note, last year's bumper corn and soybean crops reduced costs for ADM's corn-processing
businesses, improving margins for ethanol production. Earnings for the unit surged in the fourth quarter
to $279 million, versus $3 million in the prior-year period.

The ethanol industry faces challenges, however, as the U.S. government considers a reduced
requirement this year for blending ethanol into gasoline, which could lead to lower domestic consumption
and trigger increased competition to export the corn-based biofuel.

ADM, one of the world's largest grain and oilseed processors, plans "aggressive actions" to improve
results in its grain-trading unit, particularly in South America, Chief Operating Officer Juan Luciano told
analysts on the conference call. "We fumbled and we will correct that," he said.
The company said earnings from grain merchandising and handling dropped to $84 million in the fourth
quarter from $129 million a year earlier.
ADM also is considering its next steps in Asia, where its proposed 3 billion Australian dollar (US$2.7
billion) purchase of Sydney-based grain merchant GrainCorp Ltd. failed after the Australian government
blocked it over fears of ceding too much control to a foreign-based entity. The November ruling dealt a
blow to ADM's plans to sell more grain and commodities into China and other rapidly expanding Asian
economies.
The failed deal with GrainCorp, in which ADM maintains a 19.9% stake, drove $155 million worth of
impairment charges in ADM's fourth quarter, the company said.
Overall, ADM reported a profit of $374 million, or 56 cents a share, down from $510 million, or 77 cents
a share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as charges related to GrainCorp, adjusted earnings rose to
95 cents from 60 cents.
Revenue decreased 3.1% to $24.14 billion.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of 85 cents and revenue of $24.7 billion.

ADM in December said it plans to move its headquarters from Decatur, Ill., to Chicago.
