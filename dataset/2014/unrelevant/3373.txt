eing part of the "it" crowd used to mean fagging behind the school bins, hanging out in hidden cafes down
dingy alleyways, and landing enough party invites to fill your diary. Social media has moved the popularity
stakes into virtual ground - networks such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest where the
influencers lead, and followers hang off their every post - have become powerful points of reference for
trend setting. Chinese smartphone company OnePlus, a subsidiary of Oppo, has realised the power of
social media for seed marketing, and has chosen to sell its flagship phone by "invite only" outside China.
Carl Pei, director of OnePlus Global, says the invitation system was less about creating buzz and more
about managing inventory. "Ordering too much up front would have killed us," he says. "We needed to
manage the number of devices reaching consumers so our logistics and support teams would have a
chance to catch up." The phone in question, which the company is calling the "2014 flagship killer", has
top-end specs that can compete with leaders such as Samsung's Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia's Z2 and HTC's
One M8. The brain is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with global 4G LTE; the screen is a
13.9-centimetre, 1080p display; the camera is a 13-megapixel Sony Exmor with f/2.0 aperture; and the
operating system is the highly regarded CyanogenMod based on Android 4.4. In all, a competitive list of
features. The game changer is the $300 price point; the company forgoing profits for the first two years to
deliver a benchmark phone at a third of the cost of its competitors. Problem is, you have to know someone
to get one, or be lucky enough to win one through a social media contest. Clever techies didn't let random
selection stop them. A wiki on tech siteWhirlpool was set up to explain how the system works, telling
Australian customers how to register for an invitation, and allowing Whirlpool members to refer one
another. Pei says OnePlus targeted early adopters, banking on them to spread the word. "Early adopters
are far more likely to take a chance on an unknown company selling their phones solely online. These
people tend to be quite active in online forums and social media and were crucial in helping us grow."
Where the invitation scheme took a wrong turn was with a "Ladies First" promotion that called on females
to draw the OnePlus logo on their bodies and take a selfie, with the
50 most "liked" women given the option to buy the phone. Within hours, women had slammed the
queue-jumping contest, labelling it insulting, degrading and sleazy, with one woman posting a photo of
herself flipping the bird to the company. The promo was canned on the day it launched and OnePlus
apologised, admitting the contest was misguided and perpetuated an offensive stereotype. Pei says
selling the phone at cost, with no real marketing budget, has forced the company to market creatively but
admits the body selfie campaign was a mistake. In September, via its forum, OnePlus announced plans to
allow pre-orders for the One phone, which Pei confirms should be in place by the end of October. The
invitation system will continue but, as with Google's Nexus series of phones, One won't be available
through telcos, sold online only. As the bold Chinese disruptor moves into India and Australia, Pei says
availability may open up, especially as it has lost customers who wouldn't wait. "Selling directly online may
not be the best solution for every market. As we grow and expand, we'll explore potential partnerships."
But in the lead up to Christmas sales, the elusive OnePlus One device has some stiff competition seven
months after its debut, with consumers now weighing up the iPhone6, Moto X, Nexus X and Galaxy Note
4 among the new offerings. Another problem is concern about One's lithium polymer battery, which

OnePlus responded quickly, dispatching staff to the victim, and reimbursing him for all costs. "We did
have one unfortunate incident of a user's battery smoking," Pei says. "To the best of our knowledge, it
was an isolated incident." It's not the only phone to spontaneously combust - some Samsung and Apple
phones have also met fiery ends. Whether one lemon will be enough to extinguish desire for China's
underdog remains to be seen. Clearly, the phone is hot property, but nobody wants a literal interpretation.
