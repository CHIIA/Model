Rail haulage giant Aurizon has won more time to come up with a viable infrastructure plan for the
greenfield $7.4 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project, as the project's owners insist the falling iron ore
price will not kill off the project.
Aurizon took control of the West Pilbara iron ore project by teaming up with Chinese steel giant
Baosteel in a $1.42 billion takeover of the project's majority shareholder, Aquila Resources.

When they lobbed the bid in May, spot iron ore was about $US105 a tonne, a far cry from the $US83
it is trading at now.
On Thursday, the West Pilbara project's other two owners, US private equity firm AMCI (American
Metal & Coal International) and Korean steel giant POSCO, offered their first formal show of support
for Baosteel and Aurizon.

They signed an infrastructure agreement giving Aurizon exclusivity to come up with a development
plan for a new deepwater port at Anketell Point and a rail system underpinning the project. Aurizon's
exclusivity was extended by about six months to January 2016, on the proviso it can provide base
tariffs that Baosteel and POSCO were happy with.

BoAML analyst Matt Spence says Aurizon would have to rely on hitting Baosteel with a high port and
rail charge of about $36 a tonne, to justify committing to the project.
"Aurizon is effectively taking credit risk for 16 years [the mine's lifespan] with a Chinese SOE," he
wrote in a note.

"Unfortunately Baosteel has some form in altering terms in 'take-or-pay' contracts."Speculation quelled

AMCI and POSCO's commitment will put to bed – at least for a while – speculation that they have
been looking to cash out their project stakes of about 25 per cent apiece. The project had been stalled
since 2009 amid a funding stand-off between AMCI and Aquila, but the Aquila takeover has renewed
co-operation.

A POSCO spokesman told The Australian Financial Review from Perth that he was confident the
project would be viable at current iron ore prices.

He said Aurizon had been granted a "study period".

"It is a unique project – [there are] four parties with very different interests so co-operation and
negotiation are very important."

Aurizon chief Lance Hockridge described the project as a "long-term consideration for Aurizon, driven
by long-term demand for quality Australian resources and the support of three large scale global
companies".

its $6 billion price tag. Construction of the iron ore mine has been costed out at $1.4 billion.
Production of about 40 million tonnes a year is expected within a few years of the mine coming online
in 2018.

Anketell would be the first major port built in the Pilbara since Rio Tinto's Cape Lambert in 1972.
