SHEEPSKIN processors are anxiously watching for any more trade bans following Russia’s decision
last week to stop some food and fibre imports.

The already depressed skin market would be even tougher according to traders, with even the best
sucker skins only attracting about $8 at Bendigo on Monday, compared to up to $25 in the past.

Victoria’s most valuable exports to Russia are skins and hides, worth about $29 million a year. To date,
sheepskins are exempt.

Australian Lamb Skin Processors director Darren Vinton said he had sheepskins on ships heading to
Russia when the bans were announced.

“It would have been hard if sheepskins had been banned, because we would have needed to bring
those skins back,” Mr Vinton said.
“If a ban was put in place, it could have a major impact on our business.” Mr Vinton said the two major
customers for sheepskins were Russia and China, and half the skins bought by China ended up in
Russia anyway.

“The end result if there is a ban placed on Australian sheep skins is that less will be paid to the
producer,” he said.

Sutton Grange lamb producer Noel Davis said he didn’t factor skin values much into the income he
received for lambs, including those he sold for $105 at Bendigo on Monday.

But when skin prices were good, they could boost returns.
