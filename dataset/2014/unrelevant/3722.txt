Capital Gain

A $400 million-plus mixed-use village with two skyscrapers rising 67 and 51 levels is mooted to replace
a rundown car park at 380 Lonsdale Street - a site purchased by listed Singaporean developer Hiap
Hoe 10 months ago with a permit for one 46-level building.

In another show of how fast Melbourne planning precedents have shifted in just a year, the proposed
village will contain 1040 apartments and 469 car park bays compared with the permitted 627 flats and
774 bays.
Soon after buying the site Hiap Hoe announced it would engage boutique architect firm Elenberg
Fraser to design a new concept for the site, which also has access to Little Lonsdale Street. At the time
it was suggested the proposal would include two towers rising about 51 and 47 levels.

The taller skyscrapers in Elenberg Fraser's latest proposal will sit above a five-level podium.
More than 300 flats will be configured as hotel suites, continuing a theme in many proposals recently
lodged by offshore developers for residents to live with visitors. Retail, office, function space and
rooftop recreation facilities will also form part of the proposed new project.
Hiap Hoe paid $43.8 million for the 3165-square-metre Lonsdale Street site as part of a $177.8 million
spending spree that also saw it buy a Docklands development site and Bourke Street shopping centre,
with airspace expected to be developed with offices.

Also this week, another Singapore developer, Aspial, lodged plans with Planning Minister Matthew Guy
to replace a low-rise office at 383-405 King Street - until recently occupied by National Australia Bank -
with a 23-level, 392-apartment building.

In June it approached Mr Guy again to boost the height of a proposed 49-level tower at 54-64 A'Beckett
Street to 81 levels. The minister also approved Aspial's plans for the revised 70 Kavanagh Street
building - set to be the southern hemisphere's first 100-storey super-scraper.

Inn on offer
Another major development site in Parkville's tree-lined Royal Parade is about to hit the market,
carrying price expectations, sources say, of about $10 million.

The Parade Inn motel, on 3221 square metres at 535-541 Royal Parade, has been listed for the first
time since the early 1980s, targeting hotel investors and residential developers likely to build a much
taller building.
The 41-room Parade Inn site also has frontage to The Avenue.

4500-square-metre landholding at 303-305 Royal Parade and 80-90 The Avenue. Monash University
also has a Parkville campus at 381 Royal Parade.

In May, an educator of a different kind - the Australian Ballet School - paid $4.7 million for the historic
Queen Anne mansion Auld Reekie at 511 Royal Parade, near the Parade Inn, which is being marketed
by CBRE's Josh Rutman, Scott Callow, Mark Wizel and Ed Wright.

Luxury in 'burbs

As it enters the final stage of construction, Cedar Woods is seeking tenants for what may be the
western suburbs' most exclusive new office space.

The 100 Overton Road office building is part of the $30 million Williams Landing Shopping Centre,
about 20 kilometres from the CBD. The Perth-based developer is asking rents of about $350 per
square metre per annum - which is comparable with some (albeit much lower-quality) inner-city
offerings.

The office is premium grade, NBN ready and available configured as suites from 50 to 1000 square
metres. Jones Lang LaSalle's Colin Dioguardi is representing Cedar Woods.

Genesis fits in

A local investor has paid $5.7 million for a strata-titled fitness centre at the bottom of the near-new
Adesso complex in Mentone, in south-east Melbourne.
Based on the annual rent of $617,000, which the Genesis fitness club is paying, the asset sold on a
yield of 10.8 per cent - substantially higher than current bank borrowing rates.

The 2245-square-metre facility includes 70 car parks and was offered with a 12-year lease to Genesis.
The gym has the option to stay for two further five-year terms.
Knight Frank's Marcus Quinn and Tim Grant marketed the site at 86-88 Balcombe Road as a
"double-digit yield investment".

Swann song
A China-based investor is paying $21.6 million for an unrenovated art-deco CBD office on a large block
with redevelopment potential at 22 William Street, near the Yarra River.
Swann House, a 10-level, 5700-square-metre complex on an 826-square-metre site, sold shortly after
a recent expression of interest campaign that called for local and international developers.
The concrete office was developed by the SEC on the site where in 1835 a Melbourne founder John
Pascoe Fawkner built his first house, later used as a hotel.

Occupants of the upper levels at 22 William Street would enjoy postcard views beyond Southbank and
over the low-rise and heritage protected Immigration Museum abutting the site to the south.

Immediately north, CBUS recently announced a major village would replace the former National Mutual
office at 447 Collins Street. Last month Mirvac announced it would build a 38-level, 50,000-
square-metre commercial building nearby at 477 Collins Street.

Extendable

A private investor has paid $9.5 million for the CBD's Duckboard House, a building that for 60 years
was owner-occupied by the RSL.

The asset - now a fully leased office and retail investment - was offloaded by local investor Applied
Capital, which extended it by two levels in 2008 at a cost of nearly $3 million.

Applied Capital paid the RSL $3.1 million for the then three-level complex at 91-93 Flinders Lane. The
RSL bought the 1930s art deco building in 1949 for $40,000.

Duckboard House now has a lettable area of about 1000 square metres. On the ground floor is
restaurant and bar Papa Goose.

Alexander Robertson selling agent Kristian Peatling said the deal reflected a healthy price per square
metre of $9500. Five years ago, he said, the price per square metre of a similar building in the area

provides further development potential, he said. Duckboard House sold on a yield of 5 per cent.
