A severe world shortage is tipped for later this decade
CHINA imported historically high quantities of uranium last year, apparently pre-purchasing at low
prices before the commissioning of new nuclear plants.

The spot price rose just US25c a pound last week, to $US35.75/lb, insufficient to encourage a
uranium explorer to get out of bed in the morning, let alone contemplate starting a new mine. Yet it
was reported that this slight upward movement was triggered by news that an ``institutional investor''
was in the market for one million pounds of the stuff.

So it seems stockpiles are quietly being worked on, especially by people who have read the graphs
showing a severe world shortage later this decade. The rest of the world, meanwhile, continues to
sleepwalk towards that impending crisis.
The Chinese imports are contained in the latest China Resources Quarterly from Westpac and the
Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics. Last year, China imported $US2.39 billion worth of
uranium.
The Chinese figures for nuclear power are a little misleading, it seems. As the report says, investment
in new plants fell by 23 per cent (year on year) in the December quarter due to a delay in
commissioning new plants in 2012 (presumably the stand-still period when China was reassessing its
plans in light of Fukushima).

But then look at what lies ahead. Somewhere north of 37,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity is under
construction, but projects now on the drawing board exceed a further 60,000MW.
No wonder Chinese buyers are quietly buying up while yellowcake is available at clearance-sale
prices.
Christopher Ecclestone, mining strategist at London's Hallgarten & Co, says Argentina is also an
interesting country to watch. It is building a third power reactor. The country is also in the forefront of
developing new technologies, having designed a small modular reactor to be used in Saudi Arabia to
power desalination plants.
Ecclestone's argument is that Argentina has no uranium production, so there's a certain logic in
looking to fill that gap.
The one Australian company there is Tony Sage's Cauldron Energy (CXU), which has four projects,
including ground containing the Los Colorados uranium mine, which operated from 1992-96.
Ecclestone seems curious as to why the company is not doing more work there.
Perhaps because its hands are full here. As reported by this newspaper on Saturday, the mining
warden expressed doubts that Cauldron had the financial capability to explore for uranium on pastoral

Minister Bill Marmion not to accept the warden's recommendation.
Meanwhile, Mike Young has moved into the MD's office at Energy & Minerals Australia (EMA), which
has the very large Mulga Rock uranium project northeast of Kalgoorlie, discovered by the Japanese in
1979 but relinquished when uranium prices collapsed a few years later.
EMA will no doubt be looking for Young to repeat his company-building success, which saw BC Iron
(BCI) get into iron ore production. The company is targeting 1400 tonnes a year of uranium
production.
Young has uranium experience, having worked at the Beaverlodge uranium mine in Saskatchewan
and was part of the exploration team that discovered the McArthur River mine in that province, the
world's largest high-grade uranium deposit, now mined by Canada's Cameco.

Life in rare earths

THERE'S still a bit of life in rare-earth speculation, it seems. Zinc miner Terramin Australia (TZN)
received a 12.1 per cent share boost with the news it had discovered rare earths at the historic
Kapunda copper mine in South Australia. The company reported the presence of heavy rare earths,
along with neodymium (used in magnets, and technically a light rare earth) and europium (provides the
colour red in screens, classed as a medium rare earth).

There is also scandium, which can be used in aluminium alloys to provide strength for such things as
golf clubs and aircraft wings.

It's a real case of old dogs learning new tricks -- Kapunda, that is, not so much Terramin. Kapunda was
Australia's first copper mine, opening in 1842 and closing in 1877 due to water inflows. Now it may be
back at the sharp end again, containing as it does several rare-earth elements classed by the US as
``critical metals''.

Making a mint

A READER poses this question: the Perth Mint is working three shifts weekdays and two on Saturdays
to meet demand for gold and silver coins, so does this make it Australia's most successful
manufacturing business?
Even the gold bears at ANZ Research are having second thoughts about the yellow one, their Friday
note saying their bias is for a continued push higher in the near term.

``Technically, the $US1308 an ounce level is a key hurdle,'' the note says. ``Beyond this, the market
will look to target a broader recovery to $US1365/oz.''
And there went gold, closing on Friday at $US1319/oz, well and truly through that $US1308 technical
level. ANZ says speculators have covered short positions, pushing net longs on Comex to a
three-month high.

We believe our ``we told you so'' moment looms.
However, that doesn't mean the gold sector will not have to adjust. Last week, three of the world's
majors (Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold and Goldcorp) reported annual losses totalling $US16 billion
($17.8bn), due mainly to writedowns on reserves still in the ground. Canada's SNL Metals Economics
Group expects most of the gold producers to lower their reserves values to about $US1100/oz. Barrick
in 2012 valued its reserves at $US1500/oz and the other majors were not much less.
On the local scene, Southern Gold (SAU) has been sharpening its pencil in league with its mining and
transport contractors, and looking at refining costs. Its C1 cash costs at the Cannon project in Western
Australia are now down to $964/oz. The company forecasts a $12.4m free surplus cashflow at a
$1400/oz spot price; on Thursday, when SAU did its calculation, the spot was at $1429/oz.
And 3D Resources (DDD) is out of the gold business, banking $1m on Thursday after accepting an
offer from Hanking Gold Mining to buy out 3D's 15 per cent share of profits from the mothballed
Southern Cross goldmine, bought by the Chinese from St Barbara (SBM). The junior feels reopening
the mine is not justified at present gold prices, and that $1m will come in handy for work at its coal
project on New Zealand's North Island. Hanking, presumably, is happy to sit on the gold in the
meantime.
