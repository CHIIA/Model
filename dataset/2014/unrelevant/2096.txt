Trade policy: Overview
New Zealand's economy is highly dependent on foreign trade. The free-on-board value of exported
goods, including re-exports, dropped to NZ$45.7bn in 2013, down by 2.1% from NZ$46.7bn in 2012. New
Zealand's largest export markets are Australia, followed by China, the US and Japan. The
cost-insurance-freight value of imported goods fell to NZ$46.5bn in 2013, down by 2.2% from NZ$47.5bn
in 2012, according to Statistics New Zealand. The main sources of imports in 2013 were China, Australia,
the US and Japan.

The trade balance (which includes services) had a surplus of NZ$2.4bn for 2013, a recovery from the
NZ$99m deficit of 2012 and in line with the surpluses of NZ$2.9bn in 2009, NZ$3.0bn in 2010 and
NZ$2.8bn in 2011. By order of trade value, dairy products, meat, and logs and wood articles were the top
three exports in 2013. Mechanical machinery, petroleum, and vehicles were the top three imports.

Trade policy: Tariffs and import taxes

About 95% of imports are duty free. Virtually all items subject to tariffs may not be altered without an
official trade-pact renegotiation (under the terms agreed with the World Trade Organisation's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and more than half of all import categories
carry no duties. New Zealand's tariff rates have declined significantly since the 1980s. The highest tariffs
are now 10% (for some textiles); this contrasts with the 200% tariff protection that some industries
enjoyed in 1984. Industrial tariffs are now typically well below 10% for goods where tariffs still apply-less
than one-third their level in 1988. New Zealand also operates a tariff-concession system that allows
duty-free entry when it can be shown that suitable alternative goods are not made locally.

Tariff cuts were implemented in the 1990s, but rates were frozen in 1999, pending a review. Prior to the
freeze, tariffs on textiles, footwear and clothing were to be phased out by July 1st 2006. Although the
post-2005 tariff review, released in 2003, recommended removing all remaining tariffs, the government
opted to streamline remaining tariffs into three tariff bands by July 1st 2006 (namely, 5-7.5%, 10-12.5%
and 17-19%) and two bands by July 1st 2009 (5% and 10%). The imports attracting the higher 10% rate
are primarily clothing, footwear and carpets, but the rate also applies to some types of motor vehicles,
such as motor homes and ambulances. The lower rate applies to several items, including some plastics
and rubber, some chemicals, some pharmaceutical products and some meat products. A commitment
under the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum to remove all import tariffs by 2010 was not met.
The National Party-led government announced in October 2009 that the tariffs would remain at 5-10%
until 2015 at the earliest.

With few exceptions, imports are subject to a goods and service tax (GST) of 15% (up from 12.5% before
October 1st 2010), payable at the time of entry. The government introduced an import-transaction fee in
December 2002 on every commercial import that has a duty and/or GST liability of more than NZ$50, to
cover the costs of goods clearance. The New Zealand Customs Service is responsible for collecting
import entry transaction fees, which apply at the rate of NZ$46.89 (including GST) in 2014 (including a
NZ$17.63 biosecurity risk-screening levy). The import-transaction fee does not apply on the following:
noncommercial imports valued up to NZ$1,000; unaccompanied baggage; some household goods; and
temporary imports (that is, goods that will be re-exported within 12 months). However, jewellery, clothing

Page164of266©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.and electrical appliances imported from abroad have incurred a NZ$24.75 import-transaction fee since
July 2010.

There are excise duties on petroleum products and alcohol. Although these duties also apply to goods
produced domestically, some producers of foreign-made liquor believe the calculation basis discriminates
against them.

In October 2012 the government introduced a substantial increase in tobacco excise taxes, which will rise
by 10% (plus inflation adjustment) every January 1st of each year until 2016. The first increase occurred
in January 2013. Excise tax per thousand cigarettes increased from NZ$442.10 in 2012 to NZ$490.11 in
2013, and to NZ$545.39 in 2014.

The amount of duty payable depends on the following three criteria:

Import classification. New Zealand uses the Harmonised System of Tariff Classification, basing its tariff
on the Customs Co-operation Council Nomenclature (Brussels). New Zealand fully integrated the World
Customs Organisation's Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System into its
tariff-classification scheme in January 1996, as the New Zealand Harmonised System Classification
(NZHSC). The NZHSC was substantially revised in January 2002 to reflect changes by the World
Customs Organisation to the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System.
Value. Most duty rates are ad valorem, based on the transaction value of the imported goods under the
GATT Customs Valuation Code.

Country of origin. Imports from Australia and Singapore are duty free (under the Australia-New Zealand
Closer Economic Agreement of 1983 and the New Zealand-Singapore Closer Economic Partnership of
2001). Imports from Canada, some developing countries, Malaysia and the 16 countries of the Pacific
Island Forum attract preferential duty rates. Tariffs will be phased out and eliminated under the
Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (Brunei, Chile and Singapore) by 2015, under the
China-New Zealand Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) by 2016, under the Malaysia-New Zealand FTA by
2016 and under the Association of South-East Asian Nations-Australia-New Zealand FTA (for the
remaining South-East Asian nations excluding Malaysia) by 2020. For a more comprehensive discussion
on international trade agreements, see International agreements above, or the website of the New
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (http://mfat.govt.nz).

Trade policy: Import restrictions

Under the Generalised System of Preferences, which applies to imports from the more developed of the
developing countries, duty is set at 80% of the standard rate. All imports from the least-developed
developing countries (as designated by the UN) became duty free on July 1st 2001. More than 97% of
these imports already entered New Zealand duty free.

There are no import restrictions and no barriers to import (such as import licensing) on any purely
trade-related grounds. Restrictions are generally for safety or public health or to comply with international
obligations. Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which replaced the Australia New Zealand Food
Standards Authority in December 2002, continues the policy of setting food standards jointly with
Australia. Under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement negotiated in 1996, New Zealand
recognises most other Australian standards (and vice versa). The major exception is for therapeutic
goods.

New Zealand has antidumping regulations governed by the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act 1988.
Essentially, it provides for fair levels of competition by counteracting the damaging effects on local
producers from the "dumping" of subsidised or excess goods on the New Zealand market. Antidumping
action was removed from trans-Tasman trade in 1990.

New Zealand also has strict health, content, safety and origin-labelling rules for imported and
domestically produced goods, and there are stringent animal- and plant-health requirements. Some
hazardous and toxic substances and products of gene technology need approval from the Environmental
Risk Management Authority under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, but this
requirement also applies to domestically produced substances and technology. New Zealand implements
most international commitments on phasing out ozone-depleting substances ahead of the dates required
under its international obligations. Import of irradiated foods is not allowed. For a full list of prohibited
imports, see the New Zealand Customs Office website (http://www.customs.govt.nz).

Foreign suppliers in particular should note the country's restrictions on packaging materials. Many
materials that are often used for packing foods (wood packing, used jute and hessian sacking, hay, straw,
rice husks and generally all materials that might be contaminated by soil or animals) are restricted in
order to guard against the spread of disease or pestilence.

October 2003. It bans the import of films, videos and DVDs without the permission of the local copyright
holder or authorised distributor for nine months from a title's first international release. The amended act
complements criminal-offence measures on counterfeiting and piracy in the New Zealand Trade Marks
Act, implemented in August 2003.

Trade policy: Taxes on exports

There are no taxes on exports in New Zealand.

Trade policy: Free ports, zones

There are no free ports or zones in New Zealand.

Trade policy: Export restrictions

Some exports require a permit or notification to the appropriate regulatory authority. These include many
live animals, much fresh fruit, wool, fish and fish meal, greenstone (New Zealand jade), some dangerous
and toxic substances, some weapons and explosives, and copper and copper-based metals to
destinations other than Australia. Other products also require permits: hazardous wastes; chemicals that
may be used in the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons; controlled, radioactive materials;
ozone-depleting substances; strategic computer equipment; aircraft; antiquities; cash amounts exceeding
NZ$10,000; some wood products; and grains, seed and potatoes.

Exports covered by UN sanctions are restricted or prohibited, and intoxicating liquor may not be exported
to the Cook Islands or Niue, both nearby dependencies in the South Pacific. Particular local-content rules
apply for duty-free access to the Australian market; generally, a product must have 50% local content.
For a full list of exports that require a permit, see the New Zealand Customs Office website
(http://www.customs.govt.nz).

Trade policy: Export insurance and credit

The government-run New Zealand Export Credit Office (NZECO) began operating in 2001 to provide
export-credit guarantees for existing companies with growth potential. Previously, there were no
government guarantees to exporters against losses resulting from political and other noncommercial
risks. The scheme extends the capacity of existing private-sector providers. There are several companies
in the field, but the most active is Norwich Insurance.

NZECO helps well-established medium-sized and large exporters expand into markets considered too
risky to attempt on their own. Applicants must be producers of goods and/or services and must be based
in New Zealand. The government's maximum liability under the scheme is NZ$740m.

NZECO provides export-credit insurance to exporters and banks against the risk of nonpayment under an
export contract arising from defined political or commercial risks. The maximum level of commercial-risk
and political-risk insurance cover provided by NZECO in April 2014 was 95% of the value of the
transaction. The application fee is 0.1% of the guarantee amount applied for, but the minimum fee is
NZ$2,000 and the maximum is NZ$40,000. Application fees of NZ$15,000 and more earn a rebate
against the premium.

The key criterion for approving a medium- or long-term credit is that at least 30% of the total export value
must be produced in New Zealand. Maximum credit terms are 5-10 years.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise provides information to exporters on export credit, NZECO and its
operations.
