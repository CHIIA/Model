0602 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia has joined an exclusive club featuring Switzerland, Japan and Iceland
where both men and women have a life expectancy of more than 80 years. According to the nation's
statisticians, male life expectancy rose to 80.1 in 2013, from 79.9 in 2012. Female life expectancy at birth
remained steady at 84.3 years. "It's worth considering that 80 years is an expectation from birth, and
statistically, the older you get, the more likely it is that you'll live to an even older age," said Denise
Carlton, director of demography at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. "So a man who is now 50 could
expect to live to 82, a 65 year old to 84, and man who is 85 this year could look forward to a 91st
birthday." (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

0536 GMT [Dow Jones] The sharp USD/JPY retreat of more than one yen from the seven-year high of
115.52 during the past one-and-a-half hour could signal a deeper correction near-term to Tuesday's low
of 113.15. The USD/JPY yen hit a low of 114.23 earlier, breaching hourly chart support at 114.37, while
hourly MACD and slow stochastic indicators have turned bearish. Spot USD/JPY is at 114.32.

0522 GMT [Dow Jones] Suntory Beverage & Food (2587.TO) is up 5.5% at Y4,195 after 3Q operating
profits of Y30.0 billion (+22% on-year) came in higher than many estimates. "While rivals all reported
weak earnings owing to the poor weather, the company saw operating profits rise 5% in Japan even as
sales volume fell 5%," notes Nomura Securities analyst Satoshi Fujiwara. The company is using funds
generated by cost savings to invest in brands, to push uptake of high-margin products, and to build an
"unassailable" position in the industry, he says.

0519 GMT [Dow Jones] General trading house Itochu (8001.TO) is down 0.4% at Y1,381 after its
Apr-Sep 1H net profit of Y152.2 billion, came in largely in line with street expectations. But Jul-Sep net
one-time losses of around Y7.0 billion, mainly on shale oil/gas operations, as well as net losses at the
company's Namisa iron ore project (located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil) "are a cause for
concern," says a coverage analyst at a domestic brokerage. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

Y10.5 billion operating profit beat guidance of Y8.8 billion, due to strong sales. The firm also raised its
1H guidance (but left its full-year projection unchanged at Y34.8 billion)--which would mark a 26th
straight year of record profits, says Nomura Securities analyst Masafumi Shoda. October same-store
sales growth accelerated to 8% on-year, helped by inbound tourism, he notes.

0506 GMT [Dow Jones] ANZ Bank has downgraded its 2014 and 2015 growth forecasts for the
Philippines to 6.2% from 6.9% and to 6.3% from 6.8%, respectively, on indication that infrastructure
spending could miss expectations amid a narrowing budget deficit. "The substantial pullback in public
spending is surprising, especially after the credit rating upgraded to investment grade in 2013 and the
typhoon reconstruction," said Eugenia Victorino, ANZ's Southeast Asia and Pacific economist. She said
the lower-than-target infrastructure spending is dampening investment growth. The Philippines'
emergence as one of fastest growing economies in the region has been in a large part due to the
government's increased infrastructure spending. (cris.larano@dowjones.com)

0357 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY gains further in early afternoon trade, rising as high as 115.52 (its
seven-year high), with stop-loss buying orders in options-related trade giving an extra lift to the
greenback, says a senior trader at a Japanese bank. "We don't see resistance at the moment and we still
don't know if this is fair value," the dealer says, adding that "it's getting overheated," possibly resulting in
adjustment through selling on the fact after Friday's U.S. jobs data. The USD/JPY now at 115.36.

0356 GMT [Dow Jones] The Bank of Thailand is unlikely to cut rates this year despite the bank's
assessment of the global and Thai economies; it has noted the country's weak exports and slow
economic recovery, economists say. At the current policy rate of 2%, both short and long-term borrowing
costs are already conducive for investment and economic growth says Nalin Chutchotitham,
Bangkok-based economist at HSBC. There are signs of recovery, though a weak one. "What is needed is
a timely execution of fiscal measures and public investment; while the challenges for exports cannot be
overcome with lower rates," Nalin says. The policy rate is likely to stay on hold through the first half of
2015, unless the economy deteriorates in the coming months.(Warangkana.Chomchuen@wsj.com)

0347 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are down at the midday break, extending Wednesday's pullback
as the recent rally in big-capitalization stocks stalls. The Shanghai Composite Index falls 0.5% to
2406.77, and is tipped to find immediate support at 2400. With the fourth plenum session and the
earnings season out of the way, investors have yet to find fresh catalysts to push the market up further. It
takes time for China's economy to be out of the woods, says HFT Investment Management, adding the
near-term market outlook is neutral. Defense and aerospace companies lead declines after being among
the top gainers; China Aerospace Times Electronics (600879.SH) eases 3.7% to CNY15.51. Steel
makers retreat after recent gains on hopes of an improvement in demand; Hebei Iron & Steel
(000709.SZ) drops 2.7% to CNY2.56. The Shenzhen Composite Index is down 0.2% at 1350.71.

0345 GMT [Dow Jones] China's government bonds are down slightly in a technical correction as the
recent strong rallies on hopes of further monetary policy loosening by Beijing appeared to have run out of
steam. The yield on the benchmark one-year government bond is up four basis points at 3.35%, while its
10-year counterpart rose three basis points to 3.61%. "The market has entered a profit-taking and
wait-and-see mode," said Shenyin Wanguo Securities. "Based on the current levels, the bond yields
seem to have exhausted their downside to some extent," the Shanghai-based brokerage added in an
investor note. (hong.shen@wsj.com)

0344 GMT [Dow Jones] China's central bank is neither injecting into nor draining funds from the banking
system this week, leaving the country's money market untouched for four weeks in a row as the supply of
cash remains ample. The People's Bank of China has offered CNY40 billion worth of 14-day repurchase
agreements, a short-term lending facility that injects liquidity into the banking system in its open-market
operation this week, offsetting the same amount of the same instruments that mature this week. As funds
remain flush and expectations grow for Beijing to further loosen monetary policy to support a slowing
economy, borrowing costs in China's money market have been declining in recent days. The weighted
average of the seven-day repo rate, a benchmark cost for short-term loans between banks, is now at
3.10%, down from 3.17% Wednesday. (hong.shen@wsj.com)

0317 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/TWD keeps rising on foreign investor buying, says a local trader. The
pair is at 30.595, higher than 30.510 traded before the local central bank's suspected intervention
Wednesday, which lifted it to 30.602 at the close of onshore trading session, traders say. "The rise in the
USD/TWD is still relatively smaller than the USD/KRW rally, so the USD/TWD is expected to keep rising
to above the 30.600 resistance," a trader says. Taiwan government bonds fall due to profit-taking after
recent losses. A trader says the TWD's recent sharp fall didn't affect the local bond market much as they
didn't see foreign investor selling in local bonds. The most-traded five-year bond yield is at 1.1643% vs.
1.1590% Wednesday. The Taiex is down 0.3%. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)
