A private investor has snapped up an industrial facility at 184 Milperra Road, Revesby in Sydney's
south for $13.95 million from 196 Milperra Road Pty Ltd. The 24,086 square metre-building was sold
on a yield of 8.36 per cent and has redevelopment potential. Colliers International's Gavin Bishop and
Jon Orsborn handled the sale. At the time of the sale 6180 square metres of the property was vacant.
Fully leased the property will show a yield of 10.54 per cent, the agents said.

Online travel giant Wotif has sold its old head office, a three-storey commercial office building in
Brisbane's fringe, for $4.25 million. The 900 square metre-office building, at 13 Railway Terrace, was
bought as an investment by a Brisbane-based private developer. The building offers future
development upside. A maximum building height of 15 storeys is allowed, with a density of 500 per
cent of the site area, which provides potential gross floor area of 6060 square metres. Greg Woods
and Robert Dunne of Savills negotiated the deal.
Listed fund CVC Property Fund has sold a property in Sydney's northern beaches for $3.6 million.
The vacant bulky goods development site, at 1 Narabang Way, Belrose, has a total site area of
21,870 square metres. The property has development approval for the construction of two bulky
goods complexes. The sale price reflected a discount of $400,000 to the carrying value of the
property at June 30, 2013. CVC said the proceeds would be used to reduce outstanding debt
facilities.
Calstock Investments has sold an industrial asset to a local private investor in South Australia's
Regency Park for $2.375 million. The 2097 square metre-building, at 605 South Road, is leased until
December 2018 to an equipment hire company which pays an annual net rent of $218,722. CBRE's
Craig Klemich and David Reid negotiated the sale.
An office-warehouse property on Melbourne's city fringe has sold for $715,000 to a private investor.
The asset, at 46 North Street, Richmond, has a building area of 210 square metres. The rent is
$27,500 a year and the lease expires in March 2014 with no further option. Gray Johnson director Matt
Hoath who negotiated the off-market sale, said the buyer liked the opportunity the property provided,
believing the building could be upgraded for a new occupier at a rental more closely reflecting the
market rental.
Makland Group has sold two industrial properties in Melbourne's west for a combined $5.58 million in
an off-market deal. The properties, 29-31 Jessica Way, Truganina (3300 square metres) and 29
Paramount Boulevard (2500 square metres), were sold to two separate investors for $3.13 million
and $2.45 million. Both reflect yields of sub-8 per cent. The tenants are Heatcraft and Australian
Natural Milk Association. Nathan Bingham and Chris Jones of Colliers International handled the
transactions.

and Jeremy Gruzewski of Colliers International and Max Prentice of Prentice Real Estate negotiated
the deal. It attracted interest from developers and owner-occupiers.
