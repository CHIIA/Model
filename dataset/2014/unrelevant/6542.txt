"Gut feeling is we are going up, but I am not going to defy sentiment .. down 10"

"Maree" said, "While there was a sharp fall in Northern Hemisphere stocks last night I cannot see we are
in the same over valuation mode here. Fair enough, some of what is going on in the north will filter through
to us. But there is something to gain from the FTA, even if only minimal. My gut feeling is still that we are
going up, but I am not going to defy sentiment, so I'll call the market down 10".
Maree added, "The slow down in China from 8+ to +7% or a little below is still fantastic growth, if in fact it
is happening, compared to the northern hemisphere. Our market has factored in a lot of negatives but we
did not rally as much as the north, we are not in the same boat even if we take the lead from what is
happening in the northern hemisphere. Our falls will be muted compared to their falls. We have $1.6/1.7
trillion in super money. Although a lot of it is held in cash or goes into property, a lot of it also goes into
stocks."

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 9.1 points to 5413.7 last evening.

Business confidence falls to 4 points in March from 7 in February
The National Australia Bank's business survey revealed business confidence fell from 7 points in
February to 4 points in March while sales fell and employment improved slightly.
Business sentiment was also weakened by the recent elevated levels of the Australian dollar, uncertainty
over the global economy and fears of a "belt tightening" federal government budget in May, the National
Australia Bank's business survey showed.
Despite the soft readings, most industries recorded a lift in conditions, particularly in the mining sector.
But the transport industry, as well as the "bellwether" wholesale sector, weakened significantly, NAB said.

"Conditions facing wholesalers deteriorated heavily in March and are by far the weakest of all the
industries covered in the survey - a concern given its characteristics as a bellwether industry," NAB said.

At the same time, indicators suggest there would be little improvement over the next few months, as
forward orders remained soft and firms continued to de-stock, the bank said, adding that capacity
utilisation suggested there was still significant slack in the economy.
More on FTA with Japan immediate win for dairy. Beef tariff cut to be phased in

"The Age" said the average Japanese car will cost about $1000 less for Australian consumers.

Japan will cut the tariff on Australian frozen beef to 19.5% from 38.5% and Australian fresh beef to 23.5%,
to be phased in over 15 years or more.
*Cheese exports for Australian producers become immediately duty free. They will also benefit from a
preferential duty free Australia only quota.

Quotas will also grow for ice cream and frozen yoghurt exports.
Australian milk products such as protein concentrates and casei nwill be immediately duty free to
Japanese markets.

Tariffs on canned products such as tomatoes, peaches and pears, and fruit and vegetable juices will be
eliminated.

NEWS OF THE DAY

Oklahoma swamped by surge in earthquakes near fracking

Bloomberg reported there have been more earthquakes strong enough to be felt in Oklahoma this year
than in all of 2013, overwhelming state officials who are tryng to determine if the temblors are linked to oil
and natural gas production. On Aprl 6 the state experienced its 109th earthquake of a magnitude 3 or
higher, matching the total for all of 2013, according to Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the
Oklahoma Geological Survey. More quakes followed, including a magnitude 4 near Langston, about 64 km
north of Oklahoma City.

Withn the past year, earthquakes thought to be tied to wastewater disposal wells were recorded in Azle,
Texas, Jones, Oklahoma and northern Ohio, thought to be linked to pumping fracking wastewater
underground.

*CAB: Looks at impact from NSW Govt intention to set service fee at 5%

Cabcharge Ltd advised that the NSW Government intention to set the service fee at 5% will result in
Cabcharge's current taxi service fee income of $28 million halving to $14 million. While this may be
mitigated by an increase in electronic payments generally and/or a decrease in the level of competition in
the transaction processing market in NSW, or a reassessment of the merchant fee arrangements with
taxi networks and incentive payments to drivers that together total approximately $10 million annually in
NSW.

Cabcharge added that while the NSW government expects savings from a lower service fee will be
available to all passengers, it will in fact only be available to those who choose to use credit/debit cards
and who can sometimes claim it as a tax deduction.

Cabcharge added it has been operating mobile phone taxi booking apps in NSW since 2009, that meet the
full range of customer service, privacy and safety standards that apply to other modes of booking services.

However, many clients including people with disabilities, many aged people and disadvantaged people
prefer to use the telephone or web based booking services which CAB continues to fully service.

CAB down 22 cents to $3.87

*MSB: Response to ASX price fall query
Mesoblast Ltd in response to the ASX price query said the company believes the decrease in the price of
its securities together with the larger than normal trading volume is primarily a result of the fall in the
NASDAQ Biotechnology Index of 4.01% on April 4 together with an increase in short positions.
Mesoblast has $250 million cash in hand.

It continues to progress late stage clinical trials across all four of its core therapeutic areas including the
Phase 3 trial of Mesenchymal Precursor Cells for chronic congestive heart failure, being conducted by
commercial partner Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.
The recent acquisition of late stage Mesenchymal Stem Cell assets provides opportunity for earlier
product launches, Mesoblast collaborator JCR Pharmaceuticals is expanding its manufacturing facility for
preparation of its commercial launch in Japan of its MSC product JR-031 to treat steroid refractory graft
vs host disease (GVHD) in children and adults after a bone marrow transplant, to be launched in 2015.

Mesoblast will meet with the US FDA shortly to discuss potential pathways for accelerated MSC product
approvals in the US for the treatment of GVHD.

business. He said, "It is however already clear to me that TWE must take action to reduce overhead
expenditure, reinvesting these savings back into consumer and brand marketing. Stronger, long term
relationships with major customers and distributors are also required if we are to drive sustainable top line

*AQP: Offers to purchase convertible bonds/followed by rights issue

Aquarius Platinum Ltd announced it is launching a tender offer today that will expire on April 11 unless
extended, to purchase a minimum of $US15 million and a maximum of $US225 million in principal
amount of the outstanding $US300 million convertible bonds with a maturity date of December 18 2015.
Following expiry of the tender offer the company proposes to make a partly underwritten rights issue to
raise not less than the minimum Tender Offer acceptance level of $US150 million, details to be
announced after expiry of the tender offer.
However Aquarius believes, given the existing convertible bonds convert at $US6.578 per common share,
subject o adjustment on the occurrence of certain events, it is thought highly unlikely that existing
convertible bond holders will choose to exercise their conversion rights prior to the maturity of the Existing
Convertible bonds, that the company will be required to redeem at their principal amount on their final
maturity date of December 18 2015.
The board believes investor uncertainty on whether Aquarius Group will be able to repay any portion of
the Existing Convertible Bonds that remain outstanding weighs on the common shares.
With the operations having returned to more sustainable levels, and with about $US64 million before tax
to be received from the sale of its 50% share and loan in the Blue Ridge mine and its 50% effective
interest in the Kruidfontein prospecting right, the company intends to use the proceeds to strengthen the
balance sheet.

with over 1,000 millimetres of rain recorded at site in the four days to April 4. The ensuing flooding caused
significant damage to main roads, including teh only access road to the mine and a key bridge. The
damage has isolated the mine site from critical supplies of fuel necessary for onsite power generation as
well as food and medical supplies.

to an unacceptable level, potentially endangering the 200 personnel onsite. The decision to evacuate all
personnel from site was taken.
Consequently the Gold Ridge Operations have been suspended. For the six months to December 31
2013 Gold Ridge produced 29,431 ozs of gold, representing 15% of St Barbara's total gold production for
the period. The company is in continuing discussions with the Solomon Islands Government regarding the
