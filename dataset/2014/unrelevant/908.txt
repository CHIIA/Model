Goodman Group could offload up to $1 billion of assets in Sydney and Melbourne with the potential to
be turned into apartments over the next 10 years, under a new Urban Renewal division.
A $200 million prime industrial slab in Sydney's Homebush is expected to become the next asset sold
by the new division, charged with unlocking value from a portfolio worth $23 billion.

Sources close to Goodman and other landowners at the 52-hectare site on Carter Street, John Swire
and Sons and The Sutton Group, expect NSW's Department of Planning in coming days to rezone
the Urban Activation Precinct for housing and employment.

The news comes in the midst of efforts at Goodman to ramp up Urban Renewal activity, targeting
growing demand among developers for middle ring sites carrying apartment approval.
The division helped net $73 million in November from the sale of a North Ryde business park to
Chinese residential developer Country Garden. In May, the group earned $100 million selling a site
in Alexandria to Meriton.

Goodman has 14 urban renewal projects on industrial sites across Sydney and Melbourne, including
Fisherman's Bend and Cambridge Street in Epping, and is understood to be focused on obtaining
apartment approval before selling. The group declined to comment on the new division, but has in
past months flagged potential for up to 20,000 apartments across the sites, and to generate sale
prices up to 3-times book value, CLSA analysts said.

Analysts are mixed on the impact of future asset sales. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Rich does not
expect sales to meaningfully change the group's operating profit profile, but said it would help
underwrite its 6 per cent earnings growth target. Others are more upbeat, saying good sales results
could bring about a positive earnings surprise and could help fund future development.

Chief executive Greg Goodman told shareholders in November that urban renewal projects would
reduce available logistics space, but customers would be relocated to higher-density sites in new
markets.

A Planning spokesperson said plans for Carter Street will be revealed "imminently" but could not
comment on how many apartments the site will carry approval for.

Developers will pay $110,000 to $140,000 per unit on middle ring sites, CBRE's Matthew Ramsay
said. Unit prices at Sydney Olympic Park, adjoining Carter Street, have risen 15 per cent in 12
months, he added.
