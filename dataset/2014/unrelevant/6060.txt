Australian stocks have fallen with iron ore miners pulling the ASX200 down 54 points or 1% to
5463.1.

Despite this this cashed up Fraser Range nickel explorer provided some market interest.
Legend Mining (ASX:LEG) is up 12.5% to $0.009. The company has over $12 million in cash
and listed shares as at 30 September and has another $11.5 million on its way from the sale of
its Ngovayang project.
This soon to be $23 million compares to its market cap of just $16 million and will allow a
comprehensive deep nickel drilling campaign with no dilution.
In August the company commenced a major moving loop electromagnetic survey over its Fraser
Range Project in Western Australia.

Due to its unique location the project is considered prospective for not only Nova style
nickel-copper but also Tropicana style gold mineralisation.
Freelancer (ASX:FLNgt; is up 1.54% to $0.66 with the company launching its Freelancer App for
Apple iOS.
This allows its global member base of more than 13.7 million skilled freelancers and employers to
work on almost any device they choose.

ASF Group (ASX:AFA) is up 13.16% to $0.215 Millennium Minerals (ASX:MOY) up 14.75% to
$0.07 and Tiaro Coal (ASX:TCM) rose 22.22% to $0.011.
