2359 GMT [Dow Jones] The sleeper in Macquarie Atlas Roads Group's (MQA.AU) portfolio could be
about to wake up, says Macquarie. Macquarie Atlas bought the Dulles Greenway tollroad in the U.S.
state of Virginia in 2005, but traffic growth quickly disappointed. "In the past Greenway has been seen as
little more than an option, however in the last 15 months with growth returning to the corridor, we expect
Greenway should be out of 3-year lock up in 2016 and return to dividend paying from 2018," says
Macquarie, which values Greenway at A$0.70/share ($0.65). Unless alternative routes are again
widened, Greenway will capture network growth from Loudon County. "Thus we see upside to our 2.5%
traffic growth forecast over the next 5 years and 1.0% thereafter," Macquarie says. A 1% lift in FY15
traffic expectations adds A$0.07 to the broker's valuation, while a 1% lift over five years adds A$0.28.

Macquarie rates MQA at outperform with a A$3.48 price target, offering 11% upside to its last trade of
A$3.14. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

23:59 GMT [Dow Jones] Offshore accounts at five foreign brokerages place net sell orders for 900,000
Japanese shares overnight, according to traders. The premarket selling may be negative for the market
at the open, although the yen value basis of the figures is unknown. Sell orders total 6.2 million shares,
with buy orders amounting to 5.3 million shares. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

23:50 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse keeps its Underperform rating on Crown Resorts(CWN.AU) and
trims its target price 5.2% to A$15.45 after lowering its Melco Crown (MPEL) valuation to US$35.75 from
US$40.00 on lower VIP growth assumptions. It expects normalized EBITDA of A$744.4 million, 3% less
than the consensus. CWN last A$14.75. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

23:46 GMT [Dow Jones] Cardinal Health (CAH) reached a deal to become the new primary supply of
brand-name and generic drugs to Fred's (FRED), which operates about 360 in-store pharmacies, as well
its EIRIS Health Services, a new specialty pharmacy division in the U.S. This is an incremental win for
Cardinal, since pharmacy sales last year were about $731 million, according to Leerink analyst David
Larsen. But this is also an incremental loss for AmeriSource Bergen (ABC), which had previously
supplied Fred's, he notes.(ed.silverman@wsj.com)

2345 GMT [Dow Jones]--The ANZ Truckometer indexes--which use traffic volume data from around the
country--suggest slower pace of growth in 2Q but robust for the remainder of the year, says ANZ senior
economist Sharon Zollner. "While the foot may be easing off the accelerator, there are no signs of an
economy going into a panicked skid." The seasonally adjusted heavy traffic index was down 2.6% on
month and the light traffic index was flat. The heavy traffic index primarily covers trucks and tends to be
contemporaneous with GDP growth, while the light traffic index covers mainly cars and vans and gives a
six-month lead on GDP growth. "Together they suggest quarterly GDP growth in 2Q may slow compared
to recent strong outturns, but that momentum will remain solid over the rest of the year," Zollner
adds.(lucy.craymer@wsj.com; Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2345 GMT [Dow Jones] Iron-ore prices are easing, with an oversupply of the bulk commodity continuing
to weigh on the market, according to ANZ analysts. Demand in China for imported lump--a type of iron
ore that resembles small rocks--is strong, though, due to low domestic supplies, they say. "Market
reports suggest demand for lower-grade lump is particularly strong with some trades running out of
cargoes to sell," the analysts write in a note. Still, steel mills remain constrained by tight credit conditions,

Monday to $95.30/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

2338 GMT [Dow Jones]--Bendigo & Adelaide Bank's (BEN.AU) provisioning looks too thin, argues UBS.
The brokerage says a collective provision balance of A$43 million to protect a A$53.11 billion loan book
is just too low. "As a result any deterioration in asset quality will fall straight to the [profit and loss].
Leverage cuts both ways." Still, it says BEN delivered a solid result for fiscal 2014. It retains a neutral
stance and lifts its price target to A$12.10/share from A$11.20. BEN shares ended Monday at A$12.46.

2331 GMT [Dow Jones]--Dry conditions in northern North Island and continued land use change in South
Island led N.Z. sheep numbers to fall 3.2% over the 2013-2014 season to 29.8 million, while beef cattle
numbers rose 1.6% to 3.76 million, says industry group Beef + Lamb following a survey. It adds that the
increase in beef cattle numbers reflects good feed conditions and improved returns, which led farmers to
hold on to older cattle. While, B+LNZ Economic Service Chief Economist Andrew Burtt says strong
mutton prices, driven by rising demand from North Asia, encouraged a high level of cull ewe processing
for the second year in a row. The service estimates the dairy herd increased 0.7% in the year to 30 June
2014, reflecting increasing numbers in the South Island. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; Twitter:

2331 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares in Australia's Buru Energy Ltd. (BRU.AU) may have been savaged in
recent months, but J.P. Morgan isn't giving up hope. It has dropped its price target on the company's
shares to A$1.74 ($1.61) from A$2.36, which is still well above their most recent trade of 69.5 Australian
cents. Buru owns conventional and unconventional oil and gas plays in Australia's remote Canning Basin
and J.P. Morgan reckons it has enough funding to cover crucial drilling and flow testing slated for the
next 18 months. "We think the Canning Basin is one of the most prospective basins in Australia and Buru
offers a pure play on both the oil and tight wet gas plays in the Canning," the broker says.

2330 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian consumer confidence retreated sharply in the week ending Aug. 10
following news unemployment had risen to its highest level in 12 years in July. The ANZ Bank-Roy
Morgan Research's measure of consumer confidence declined for a second consecutive week, falling a
sharp 5.7%, to 108.5, in the week ending Aug. 10. Unemployment jumped to 6.4% in July from 6.0% in
June, according to government data last week. "Consumer confidence recently appears to be more
sensitive than usual to economic news, said the ANZ Bank's chief economist, Warren Hogan. Household
perception about economic conditions in a year's time fell 9.1% over the week. (james.glynn@wsj.com;

2326 GMT [Dow Jones] Could bauxite pricing go the way of bulk commodities? Possibly, if Rio Tinto's
(RIO) Chief Financial Officer Chris Lynch has his way. Mr. Lynch said he would like to improve disclosure
for bauxite and alumina where revenue is currently combined, according to J.P.Morgan analysts who
attended a forum hosted by the executive. "No single pricing mechanism exists for bauxite, however the
company would like to see it evolve the way coal and iron ore have into a more liquid market," said
J.P.Morgan, which rates Rio Tinto at overweight with a A$80.00 price target. RIO last traded at A$66.75.

2323 GMT [Dow Jones] Rio Tinto Ltd. (RIO.AU) has largely shied away from major investments outside
of iron ore during the ongoing downturn in commodity prices, but J.P. Morgan thinks it will approve the $2
billion South of Embley bauxite project in Australia this year. The project will reinforce the company as
the dominant seaborne bauxite shipper to China, which is hunting for new supply in the wake of
Indonesia's ore export ban. "Our analysis of the South of Embley Bauxite Project highlights an attractive
16% internal rate of return at $45/ton free-on-board bauxite," says the broker, which rates Rio Tinto at
overweight with a A$80.00 ($17.20) price target. RIO last traded at A$66.75. (david.winning@wsj.com;
