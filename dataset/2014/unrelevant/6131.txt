There are a few hurdles to overcome for the Asian consortium of Wilmar and First Pacific in its quest to
buy one of Australia's oldest food manufacturers, Goodman Fielder, starting with price.

Goodman owns brands including Meadow Lea, Praise and White Wings and has been a chronic
underperformer for many years, well before many other food companies hit troubles associated with
high costs, low margins and the stubbornly high dollar.

Plenty of shareholders would welcome the opportunity to be taken out of Goodman at a reasonable
price but many consumers will not like the local company falling into foreign hands.

Any public relations backlash might be enough for Treasurer Joe Hockey to take a more forensic look
at the deal on public interest grounds. While plenty of Australian agribusiness and food processing
groups have been acquired by overseas interests - including Wilmar's $2.3 billion purchase of CSR's
sugar assets - the government's rejection of Archer Daniels Midland's bid for GrainCorp sets a more
recent precedent.

At the time the bid was blocked Hockey talked about competition concerns but only last week revealed
ADM's not being of good character was behind the decision. He suggested more would come out over
time.
It's worth noting that ADM is a 16 per cent shareholder in Wilmar - a company that has extensive
agribusiness interests around the world. Whether this has any influence on Foreign Investment Review
Board approvals remains to be seen. Although it shouldn't.
Having sold its "open-for-business" credentials and just completed a round of free trade negotiations
in Asia, it would appear strange to block a foreign takeover of Goodman Fielder, which has no vital
infrastructure assets.
But, even if there are no regulatory roadblocks, the Singapore-based Wilmar and Hong
Kong-domiciled First Pacific will first need to reconsider their offer price which, while pitched at 27 per
cent above Goodman Fielder's average-weighted trading price since April 2, is clearly capitalising on
the negative sentiment over a profit downgrade on that day. It represents an 18 per cent premium to
last Thursday's closing price, which appears to have been boosted by 9.6 per cent on larger than usual
volume. Let's hope the corporate regulator is taking a look at that one.

ASIC said on Monday: "We would consider any price movement ahead of corporate news as part of
our regular market monitoring activities."
While the suitors may increase the $1.8 billion cash bid, the price is not wildly shy of the mark. Not
surprisingly, the Goodman Fielderboard immediately branded it opportunistic. Interestingly it failed to
respond to the First Pacific-Wilmar request for due diligence and exclusivity. But those in the know
suggest Goodman won't be lifting its skirts unless the offer is improved.

shareholder lobby mode. Wilmar already owns 10 per cent of Goodman Fielder but will need its largest
shareholders, Perpetual and James Packer's former investment vehicle, Ellerston, on board. Both will
probably push for a higher price but be keen to ensure the bidders don't walk away from the
negotiating table.
The bigger question is what First Pacific (part of the Salim group that owns the big Indonesian
Indofood) and Wilmar want with Goodman Fielder. The answer appears to be its New Zealand dairy
operations.

In a letter to Goodman chairman Steven Gregg on Sunday, Wilmar and First Pacific said the deal
would "create a leading Asia Pacific agricultural and consumer staples joint venture with strong
financial resources and Asian understanding."

Citi analyst Gino Rossi has a slightly different take. He noted that synergies with Wilmar and First
Pacific are minimal following the sale of Goodman Fielder's edible oils, fats and grains and the
company's small presence in Indonesia. "However, plans to fast-track Goodman Fielder's expansion
into Indonesia and leverage IndoFood's distribution reach are attractive to First Pacific."

For its part Goodman Fielder takes the view that the timing of this offer is particularly interesting. The
structure of its NZ dairy business is under review and is likely to lead to enlisting a joint venture
partner to finance much-needed capital expenditure. This business had a particularly bad year after a
spike in farm gate milk prices. Incidentally, Australian wheat prices also played havoc with this year's
earnings.

While these had a potentially one-off impact on Goodman Fielder's earnings they are not the
company's only weak spots.
