PETROLIAM NASIONAL
Oil and Gas Firm Is in Talks

Over LNG Project Stakes
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Malaysia's state-run oil and gas company, said Wednesday it is in talks with
four potential partners from Japan and the Middle East for stakes in its Canadian liquefied-natural-gas
project.

The potential partners are conducting due diligence, Petronas Chief Executive Shamsul Azhar Abbas
said. He declined to name the companies involved in the discussion.

"We are in no hurry" to sell and would only agree to a deal if the terms are right, Mr. Shamsul said.
Petronas, Malaysia's most profitable enterprise and the country's sole Fortune 500 company, has
been selling stakes in its Canadian Pacific Northwest LNG project to partially offset development costs
that could be as much as 11 billion Canadian dollars (US$10.07 billion).
So far, Petronas has sold a 38% stake in the project to various partners, most recently a 15% stake to
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. in April. Petronas said that deal has received approval from the
Chinese government. Earlier, it sold 10% stakes each to Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. and Indian
Oil Corp., and 3% to Brunei National Petroleum Co.
Mr. Shamsul previously said Petronas could trim its stake to 50% in the project from 62% currently.
Petronas reported on Wednesday that net profit rose 47% to 18.33 billion ringgit (US$5.75 billion) for
the three months ended June 30, compared with 12.51 billion ringgit last year. Revenue climbed 15%
to 85.36 billion ringgit from 74.42 billion ringgit during the same quarter a year earlier.
The company aims to increase foreign operations' profit contribution to 20% within the next five years
from 10% currently, Mr. Shamsul said.

CSL

Blood-Products Maker Weighs

Share Buyback as Net Rises
Blood-products maker CSL Ltd. said it would consider another 950 million Australian dollar (US$880
million) share buyback after reporting a small rise in annual net profit on higher sales of
infection-fighting infusions in the U.S. and Europe.
The company based in Melbourne, Australia, said Wednesday that net profit rose 7.8% to $1.31
billion for the year to June 30 from a restated $1.21 billion a year earlier. The profit increase slightly

for a legal settlement in the U.S.

CSL, which competes with rivals such as Baxter International Inc. and generates most of its revenue
outside Australia, said it expects net profit in the current financial year to rise about 12% in
constant-currency terms, and earnings before interest and tax to grow by roughly 15%.
CSL is in the final stages of a A$950 million share buyback. Mr. Perreault said that when the buyback
is complete, the board would consider another of a size.

Shares in CSL advanced 2.6% to A$67.24 in Sydney.

CSL operates in more than 20 countries, and last year began reporting in U.S. dollars because the
bulk of its profit is earned overseas.
