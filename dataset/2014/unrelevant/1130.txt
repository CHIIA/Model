After being approved for demolition last year, the old Mercy Care Hospital has been given a new
lease on life, boosting industry and education in Young in the process.
In a coup for the town, the site has been sold to investors to establish a college for agricultural
education.

A joint venture partnership between Australian and Chinese investors exchanged contracts for the
purchase of the historic site on Tuesday, Roz Faulkner from Jamieson Real Estate announced on
Thursday, May 29.
The group said all the buildings on the site will be retained, including the old hospital, and they would
be mindful of the historical significance of them.

The new college, called the Australia Agriculture Academy, aims to make Young a centre of
innovative agricultural education, creating future leaders of agriculture in Australia.

Chairperson for the academy Dr John Troughton said they had big plans, aiming to cater not just to
locals but to attract international students from Asia.
