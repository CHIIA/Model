Australian Dollar Falls on Jobless Rise, Disappointing China Trade

SYDNEY--A rise in Australia's unemployment rate and a smaller-than-expected China trade surplus
provided the catalysts for a sell-off in the Australian dollar after recent strength.

At 0715 GMT, the Aussie dollar was trading around US$0.9370 after touching a five-day high of
US$0.9459 immediately following the domestic employment report, which included a slightly
stronger-than-expected rise in employment.

Overnight, the Australian dollar benefited from U.S. dollar weakness after minutes from the U.S. Federal
Reserve's June board meeting reiterated that a rise in U.S. interest rates is still likely to occur "a
considerable time" after its asset purchase program ends in October, provided longer-term inflation
expectations remained "well anchored."

But investors appeared disappointed as the rise in unemployment reduced the prospect of interest rate
hikes, and China's trade data suggested growth in Australia's biggest trading partner wasn't quite as
strong as expected.

"June's headline employment growth came in at a stronger than expected 15,000," Royal Bank of
Canada Senior Currency Strategist Sue Trinh said. "But there were soft undertones with the
unemployment rate rising to 6.0% and full-time employment falling 3,800, so it didn't take long for the
Australian dollar to give up the kneejerk gains."

Nevertheless, while Australia's June unemployment rate hit an 11-year high, some economists were
encouraged by gains in total employment and average hours worked.

"It must be remembered that the Reserve Bank of Australia had already previously expected
unemployment to rise above 6%, and we note the recent improvement of lead indicators of the labour
market suggests that there will be enough jobs growth ahead to hold unemployment around our
long-held forecast peak of 6%," UBS economists Scott Haslem and George Tharenou said in a report.

A rise in employment and steady trend rate of unemployment in June provide further evidence that the
Aussie labor market has stabilized, according to HSBC Chief Economist Paul Bloxham.

"Despite some evidence of a loss of momentum, consistent with weaker retail sales, building approvals
and consumer sentiment data--due to the Federal Budget, weaker iron ore prices and the stubbornly
high Australian dollar--there are still signs that Australia's great rebalancing act is underway," Mr.
Bloxham said. "Low interest rates are continuing to support the housing market, with housing prices
picking up in recent weeks...business confidence and conditions remained well above the low levels they
reached last year, despite the impact of the recent budget on consumer sentiment."

Still, Mr. Bloxham said the central bank was likely to continue to try to verbally encourage the Australian
dollar lower, through 'jawboning', as a lower exchange rate could speed up the economic rebalancing
process after the end of a decadelong mining investment boom fuelled by China's economic expansion.
China recorded a US$31.6 billion trade surplus in June versus market expectations of US$36.9 billion,
as exports rose less than expected in the month.
