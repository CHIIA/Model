Gentrack IPO next step in long-term growth story

Specialist utilities and airports software solutions provider Gentrack Group Limited (Gentrack or the
Company) today registered an investment statement and prospectus to raise up to $101.8 million and
seek a listing on the NZX Main Board and ASX.
The Offer comprises the issue of up to 18.0 million new ordinary shares to raise $36.0 million of new
capital and the sale of 26.3 million existing shares. The indicative price range of the shares in the Offer
will be $2.00 to $2.50 per share. The Offer will be in two parts; an institutional offer and a retail offer. The
retail offer will comprise a broker firm offer and an employee offer. There will be no public pool.

Capital raised through the issue of new shares will be used to pay down Gentrack's existing debt of $33.1
million and create a platform for further growth. The Offer will also allow some existing shareholders to
sell down shares [Existing shareholders will sell down via Gentrack Share Sale Company Limited, which
is the offeror of the existing shares under the IPO. ] which will foster liquidity and increase the size of
Gentrack's free float following the offer. Existing shareholders will continue to own approximately 41.5%
to 43.5% of the Company's ordinary shares immediately post-allotment [Calculated based on the
indicative price range. ].

The final pricing of the Offer will be determined on 5 June 2014 by means of a bookbuild to institutional
investors and retail brokers.
Gentrack Chairman John Clifford says the IPO will position the Company to build on its strong track
record of delivering mission critical software solutions to energy utilities, water companies and airports
internationally.

"A listing on the NZX and ASX provides a transparent ownership structure and strong balance sheet to
assure Gentrack's existing and future customers that it is a robust contracting partner, reinforcing its
competitive position for delivering fully operable software solutions on time and on budget."

"Gentrack has built a profitable business with compound growth of earnings before interest, tax and
amortisation of 16.1% per annum over the last five years. This growth has been underpinned by the
contracted and recurring revenues generated by new and existing installations of its Gentrack Velocity
solution for energy and water utilities and its Airport 20/20 Operational System."
The Company's software is now installed in 150 utility and airport sites. Gentrack Velocity customers
include many of New Zealand's energy utilities such as Genesis Energy, Meridian Energy and Vector;
Australian energy and water utilities including Origin Energy, Alinta Energy, Red Energy, Unitywater
and TasWater; and innovative energy players Ovo Energy, LoC02 Energy, Flow Energy and Insite
Energy in the United Kingdom. Airport 20/20 is operational in marquee international airports including
Hong Kong, JFK in New York, Newark Liberty, Sydney, Melbourne, and Birmingham as well as
Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington.

and water utilities and airports is continuing to evolve rapidly.

"Changing regulations, increasing competition, new consumer engagement strategies and technological
innovations are driving increasing demand for flexible and robust software solutions like Gentrack
Velocity and Airport 20/20. Gentrack's software solutions provide utilities and airports with the tools
required to harness real-time information flows, achieve greater operational efficiency and improve the
customer experience."

In FY2013 more than 65 per cent of Gentrack's revenue came from projects in offshore markets. To
service those markets the Company has more than 180 staff and offices in London, Melbourne and
Brisbane, retaining its R&D centre and core leadership teams in its Auckland headquarters.
