into the banks - but not much can be read into it, with a few large orders sufficient to sway the index on a
low volume day.

"Bit soft early and finish up about five/next reasonable leg has to be a down leg"

"Bernborough" said, "We are being led more by Asia at present - I expect us to be a bit soft early and
finish up about five, but a lot will depend on Asia.

"People currently don't know what to do - they are not even doing rotations (from one sector to another)
because there's not enough movement.

"I am all cashed up and want to go short, because I believe the next reasonable leg has to be a down leg,
but I've not enough confidence to do anything right now".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 10.9 points to 5295 last evening.

Shell sells its Wheatstone gas and 6.4% LNG to Kuwait Co for $US1.14 bln cash

Dalje.com (English version) and various Aussie newspapers report Royal Dutch Shell said it would sell its
interest in an Australian gas field to the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. for $1.14 billion in
cash.
"Shell will remain a major player in Australia's energy industry. However, we are refocusing our
investment to where we can add the most value with Shell's capital and technology, said Shell Chief
Executive Officer Ben van Beurden, Dalje reported.
This follows Shell's warning last week that earnings in the fourth quarter would be about $2.2 billion lower
compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, a drop of about 70 percent.
The company blamed slim refining margins and increased spending for the profit warning.

In Australia, margins are lower due to high labor costs, the Journal said.
In the $1.14 billion deal, Shell is selling its 8 percent share of the Wheatstone-Iago gas field and its 6.4
percent interest in the Wheatstone liquefied-natural-gas project in Western Australia.

Shell will publish its 4th quarter results on January 30.
