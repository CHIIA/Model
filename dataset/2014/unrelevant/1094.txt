Independent expert Grant Samuel and Associates has concluded that a proposed A$800 million ($751
million) "merger of equals" between Australia's ROC Oil and Horizon Oil is in the best interest of ROC's
shareholders, the company said Monday.

ROC commissioned Grant Samuel to report on the merger, which has been opposed by ROC's largest
shareholder, funds manager Allan Gray. Grant Samuel concluded that the benefits of the merger were
significant and outweighed the disadvantages.

"The board's decision to proceed with the merger was taken in good faith and followed an extensive due
diligence process and proper corporate governance," ROC Chairman Mike Harding said in a letter to
shareholders.

Allan Gray has called an extraordinary general meeting for July 11 at which it will put a resolution to
change ROC's constitution and frustrate the merger. Harding said the board believed that was "clearly
not in the best interests of ROC shareholders," and urged them to vote against the resolution.

The deal agreed by the boards of the two companies would see Horizon shareholders receive 0.724 of a
share in ROC, which would retain its identity as the operator of the expanded group's assets in Malaysia,
China and Papua New Guinea. ROC's existing shareholders would hold around 42% of the merged
company, with Horizon shareholders owning about 58%.
ROC and Horizon are partners in an oil field, which is currently producing around 13,000 b/d, in China's
Beibu Gulf.
The expanded company's key growth asset in Malaysia would be its 50% stake in Petronas Carigali's
D35, D21 and J4 oil fields, offshore Sarawak. The fields, currently producing 10,000 b/d of oil and
17,000 Mcf/d of gas, are to be redeveloped at a cost of $250 million.

Horizon's major contribution to the merged group would be its 30%-held Stanley and 27%-held
Elevala/Ketu projects in PNG. A $300 million development of the Stanley field has been approved by the
PNG government and is expected to be completed in 2016, producing 4,000 b/d of condensate and
140,000 Mcf/day of gas. In the longer term, Horizon's PNG assets are expected to form the basis of a
mid-scale LNG project.
