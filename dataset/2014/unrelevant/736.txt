Up to 170,000 square metres of space, or about two Chifley Towers' worth, could be withdrawn from
the struggling Brisbane office market over the next two years, according to new analysis.
Plans for residential and hotel conversions, as well as redevelopment and demolition, are key
factors that will determine the amount of withdrawal, according to Colliers International.

"We don't believe the vacancy rate will be increasing as much as previously thought," said Colliers
director of capital markets and investment Jason Lynch. "In 2016 Brisbane city will have 188,156
square metres delivered to the market. However, it is important to note the quantum of stock
withdrawals."
The future supply includes Japanese company Daisho's 174 Ann Street (180 Brisbane), the
Grocon-developed 480 Queen Street and Cbus, and ISPT's 1 William Street, which are all forecast
for completion in 2016.

However, the confirmed withdrawals so far total about 70,124 square metres. In addition the
Newman government has plans to demolish about 66,000 square metres of office space on George
Street, while numerous groups have purchased buildings for redevelopment or conversion.
They include Cromwell Group's Health and Forestry House and a host of Singaporean groups
looking to convert. Frasers is creating a hotel out of 80 Albert Street, SilverNeedle is converting
office space in Lennons Plaza to a hotel and the Aspial Corporation is finalising plans to buy the 240
Margaret Street office building, also for residential development.

Toga Far East Hotels is planning to convert a heritage-listed office building at 171 George Street into
a hotel while Investa is also considering a conversion or redevelopment of 363 Adelaide Street to
residential.

Colliers International co-director of capital markets and investment services Tom Phipps said another
key area which could prevent future supply was the conversion of mooted office tower projects.

"This category accounts for about 194,205 square metres in its own right and includes all mooted
office developments that have been changed to residential and hotel use or have been shelved," Mr
Phipps said.
Aspial's purchase of Cornerstone Properties' Albert Street development site, which was mooted for
an 18,000 square metre office tower, will be used for apartments.
"We are seeing an influx of private Chinese and state-owned developers looking to convert or
redevelop the existing office assets for residential or hotel use," Mr Phipps said.
