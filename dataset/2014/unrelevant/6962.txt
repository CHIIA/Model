A SPRAWLING coalmine and rail project worth billions could be forcing Indian developers Adani to
seek help from Chinese investors.
India’s Business Standard quotes a “high-ranking executive” who says the energy giant is courting
China Rail Corporation and others to purchase a major stake in the $16.5 billion project.

Adani and home-country rivals GVK are each racing to tap into the enormous thermal coal reserves of
the Galilee Basin in Queensland’s central west.

Adani’s Carmichael Mine has not caught up to GVK’s Alpha project yet in terms of government
approvals.
Its strength was considered to be its assured funding – Adani’s business case involves mining then
shipping the coal to its own power plants in India.
According to the report, Adani wants to sell half its stake in the project in an effort to raise $5 billion.
If approved and funded, the Adani rail/coal project would create almost 1500 jobs during construction,
followed by 3800 once operational. Adani was approached for comment yesterday but did not respond.
