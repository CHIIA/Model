Dairy prices have fallen but the industry is not crying over spilt profits just yet, according to processors
and industry analysts.
The Fonterra Global Dairy Trade has declined sharply by more than 20 per cent in the past month.

Rabobank senior analyst Michael Harvey said the majority of product sold at GDT auctions was New
Zealand product and predicted the fall in Australia’s fortunes would not be as drastic.

Mr Harvey said good growing conditions, especially in Europe and New Zealand, had put downward
pressure on prices.
‘‘Strong milk production growth, that’s what’s been putting pressure on the market,’’ he said.
In the wake of season 2013-14, the milk price was about $7/kg milk solids, inflated by strong demand
from China.

‘‘The reality was we were always going to come off the record prices,’’ Mr Harvey said.

He said the current four-year forecasts of between $6.10 and $6.30 had some potential to be reduced
due to the risks associated with Russian sanctions — currently the world’s second largest dairy
importer.
Russia has cut Australian dairy products for a year, along with beef, pork, fruit and vegetable produce,
fish and poultry.
Mr Harvey said this could further oversupply global markets, particularly in cheese.

‘‘The trade between Australia and Russia is not huge, rather it’s the knock-on effect we’re all worried
about.
‘‘Russia imports a lot of cheese, mostly from Europe, and if they impose this ban, a lot of European
cheeses will be diverted to other products or other markets and that’s a real threat to Australia as a
large exporter of cheese.’’

He said there was uncertainty on whether Russia would impose the ban for an entire year, potentially
creating food shortages in the country.

‘‘We think things will remain weak the rest of the year, then see signs of recovery early next year.’’
Murray Goulburn managing director Gary Helou said Russia was an important market for the company
with almost $95 million in business last financial year, particularly in butter.

‘‘The trade sanctions announced by the Russian Government on food exports from Australia will have
some impact on our ability to maximise returns as we place this product into other markets,’’ Mr Helou
said.

monitor the impact of the sanctions on global dairy market settings.’’
Australian Dairy Industry Council chair Noel Campbell said Russia was an important market for the
Australian dairy industry.

VFF president Peter Tuohey said he trusted the Federal Government to deliver a free trade agreement
with China with reduced tariff barriers.
For example, China’s tariff for Australian milk powders is 10 to 15 per cent while New Zealand is
charged 4.9 per cent.

‘‘What’s happened in Russia, just highlights the need for us to get strong FTAs in place that open up
more markets for Australian exports, such as China,’’ Mr Tuohey said.
