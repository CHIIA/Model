A CHINESE mainland developer has snapped up a Southbank development site next to
Melbourne’s Crown casino for $22 million and is planning its first high-rise apartment project in
Australia.
In a sign of the heat in the market, the property’s value has shot up since it last sold 12 months
ago to another Chinese group, Starryland Australia, for just $18m.

CBRE has just brokered the sale of the 940sq m site at 88 Queensbridge Street. It houses two
separate office buildings but it is set to be transformed into a Rothe Lowman-designed 55-level
tower of 295 units.

“The resale is a clear demonstration of the confidence that offshore developers have for
permit-approved sites in both the Melbourne CBD and immediate fringe markets,” CBRE city sales
director Mark Wizel said.
Mr Wizel, who negotiated the sale with CBRE’s Josh Rutman and Ed Wright, said that despite talk
about a perceived future oversupply of new Melbourne apartments, this view was not shared by
offshore buyers, who were as aggressive as ever.
The $22m sale price sets a benchmark for Southbank land at $23,400 per square metre — the
highest rate per square metre achieved in the area.A year ago, Hanover House in Southbank was
sold by Pacific Group of Companies for $18,000 per square metre.
