Chinese food importer Heilongjiang Grand Farm Group plans to spend up to $200 million buying
farms in WA as part of a $1 billion expansion involving the state's biggest meat processor.

Owned by brothers Peter and Greg Walsh, V&V Walsh is investing an undisclosed sum to buy farms
alongside Grand Farm.

The farms will provide sheep and cattle to be butchered, packed and frozen at V&V Walsh's Bunbury
abattoir, two hours south of Perth.
Grand Farm will sell the boxed sheep and beef to Chinese consumers.
"We have had our mining boom and the next big boom is going to be agriculture," chief executive
Peter Walsh said.
The deal highlights China's growing appetite for long-term beef and sheep supplies and comes a
month after iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest bought beef processor and exporter Harvey Beef in a
deal worth more than $30m.

Grand Farm wants to buy 500,000 lambs and 30,000 cattle a year, or about 3.2 per cent of the state's
15.5m sheep flock and 1.5pc of its 1.9m cattle.
V&V Walsh has also taken a minority stake in a joint venture with Grand Farms which will spend
$800m developing new sheep and beef processing facilities and feedlots in northern China.
Grand Farm, a private group and China's biggest importer of NZ lamb, wants to lock down long-term
supply.

Mr Walsh said Grand Farm which he has worked with for 15 years may buy farms in eastern Australia
and NZ.

"The farmers have missed out for too bloody long. Not any more. We need to get people encouraged
to get stocked up. We are going to see a resurgence in (sheep and beef) farming," he said.

Mr Walsh would investigate farm acquisitions during the next 12 to 18 months.

It could involve buying farms outright or striking joint ventures with local farmers, he said.
"The Chinese are always looking at the long term.

"Part of that is having security in farms and to grow with it."
Harvey Beef has been the only accredited exporter of WA beef to China.
V&V Walsh expects to gain regulatory clearance to export sheep and beef to China this year.

It processes about 3500 lambs and 360 cattle each day.

About 75pc cent of its production is sold domestically, including through Woolworths.

The expansion, expected to be completed within five years, will double exports to about 50 per cent.
There has been some concern in regional Australia about increasing Chinese investment in farmland.
Mr Walsh said even he did not "100pc agree" with the Chinese buying up farms, but said it
encouraged investment and allowed farmers to grow far more quickly.
