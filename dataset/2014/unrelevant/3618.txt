The price of Australian alumina rose $4/mt on September 17, taking the Platts daily assessment to
$338/mt FOB, driven by higher Chinese domestic prices and seasonal restocking in China during the
fourth quarter.
The Platts ex-works Henan alumina daily price rallied Yuan 30/mt to Yuan 2,730/mt (($444/mt) for
70:30 cash and credit payment terms, lifted by tighter domestic spot supply, and production problems at
a Chalco refinery in Henan province (see separate story).

A producer reported the sale on September 16 of a 30,000 mt Alcoa of Australia parcel at $340/mt
FOB, payment 10 days after documents, for shipment in mid-November. Platts was unable to verify the
deal with the buyer, nor establish if the price was immediately repeatable.

Several Asian and Western consumer, producer and trader sources said the traded price was a few
dollars higher than they expected. A Western supplier said he had expected the next spot trade to
reach $337/mt FOB Australia; a Western trader had anticipated the market to trade next at $336/mt,
while two Chinese consumer and trader sources put the market clearing rate a shade higher at
$338/mt FOB.

An Asian trader said if he had the chance he would have bid in the mid-$330s, FOB Australia.
Two Chinese consumer/reseller sources put buyers' ceilings at $357-360/mt CIF. As a guide, the range
would have suggested netting back to $335-338/mt FOB.
A third Chinese consumer/reseller placed a firm bid at $335/mt, FOB Western Australia, payment
against letter of credit at sight, for a 30,000 mt shipment within October. The bid is valid until 5 p.m.
Singapore time (0900 GMT) September 18.
Meanwhile, a fourth Chinese consumer/reseller said in the past two days sellers had indicated
guidance at around $340/mt FOB for November shipments.
In China, port stocks offers were pegged a shade higher than Yuan 2,700/mt, though trading activity
has been thin. Sellers were holding onto material in anticipation of further price increases, sources said.
Chalco's alumina production at its 2.4 million mt/year refinery in Henan's capital city of Zhengzhou
was disrupted September 17, due to possible damage to its red mud dam, sources said.
Two Chalco sources said operations had been affected, but did not specify whether operations have
been reduced or suspended. The refinery was operating at a rate of 2 million mt/year before the
incident, a source said.
Chinese alumina prices have been rising steadily in the past week on the back of limited spot
availability and strong sentiment in anticipation of seasonal restocking demand in the fourth quarter.

Yuan 14,415/mt, compared with Yuan 14,610/mt last week.
