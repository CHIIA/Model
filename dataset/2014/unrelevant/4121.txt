THE opportunity to invest in scale attracts capital to an industry. This was a message from a panel of
investors at the Australian Dairy Farm Investment Forum on Monday.

ACE Farming chief executive Jeremy Bayard said it had been “much easier to place” the $50-$100
million from investors in other agricultural enterprises and unlike dairy, if the wheat paddock is not
checked one day “nothing is going to happen”.

But all investors agreed the tide was turning and although Mr Bayard said the dairy industry — and
agriculture in general — had an image problem due to media coverage of disasters and low prices, in
the past 18 months there had been more people focusing on opportunities in dairy.
Mr Bayard said dairy would benefit from another “three, four or five groups” like Van Diemen’s Land
Company, Australia’s largest dairy operation, as investors — direct investors at the farmgate —
were less than 20 in Australia and this was a “lonely” place.

Kidder Williams managing director David Williams said most people who can came to him seeking
investment were not investment-ready.

Describing them as “dreamers” he said good farm management was crucial but often the best
managed farms were not the ones for sale.
Mr Williams stressed to the dairy industry to look outside China for investment.“We are all talking
Chinese but investment is coming in from everywhere and the Japanese have been much more
active.”
