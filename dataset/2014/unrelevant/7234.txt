Aurizon mulls track sales in Queensland

Aurizon chief executive Lance Hockridge has confirmed the rail group will consider selling a stake in its
Queensland tracks to fund expansion in mining regions. Aurizon was considering building new rail
networks in Western Australia's Pilbara region as well as Queensland's Galilee Basin to haul iron and
coal for miners, and was evaluating options to pay for the projects, Mr Hockridge said. "One option would
be the potential to sell down an interest in the central Queensland coal network," he said. Investment
bank UBS has estimated that Aurizon could generate up to $2 billion by selling 49 per cent of its
Queensland track business. Aurizon had not started talks with potential investors in the rail network
because it had not made final investment decisions on either project, Mr Hockridge said. He indicated the
Pilbara project could proceed faster than the Galilee project because Chinese partner Baosteel wanted to
start exporting iron ore as soon as possible to supply a new steelworks in China. Aurizon has delayed
signing a final agreement with its Galilee partner, miner GVK Hancock, until early next year. Mr Hockridge
cautioned it
would take about 12 months for the company to secure haulage contracts before it could start building a
new rail line and new terminal at the port of Abbot Point. "Whether it's a three-year horizon or a slightly
longer horizon, ultimately the fundamental economics will underpin both the development of T3 [terminal
at Abbot Point] and the opening up of the Galilee," Mr Hockridge said. Aurizon reported a 43 per cent fall
in annual net profit to $253 million on Monday. Although underlying earnings before interest and tax
(EBIT) rose 13 per cent on a year earlier to $851 million due to stronger coal and iron ore haulage
volumes, Aurizon did not take as much cost out of its business in the second half as forecast. Statutory
net profits were hurt by previously announced asset impairments of $317 million and voluntary
redundancy costs of $69 million as Aurizon slashed jobs and scaled back its train fleet. Analysts were
concerned to see the company flag increased capital spending on IT, track maintenance and fleet
upgrades. It plans to lift spending to about $600 million annually between 2014-15 and 2016-17 from
$350 million annually. "All of a sudden you've got a lot less cash flow coming back," said

Matthew Spence, analyst at Merrill Lynch, adding that Aurizon had not provided much "hard detail" on
how the additional spending would improve revenues. Aurizon head of operations Mike Franczak argued
the company needed higher capital spending for it to become a world-class operator.
Aurizon will look to cut costs by up to $300 million over two years as a "risk mitigation" strategy against
the possibility of industrial action and flooding in Queensland, and a new regulatory agreement with the
Queensland Competition Authority. Aurizon shares fell 3 per cent, or 15ï¿½, to 44.88.
