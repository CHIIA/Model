Weaker export receipts and healthier imports in April resulted in Australia's first goods and services trade
balance shortfall since November 2013. The seasonally adjusted goods and services trade deficit came
in at AUD122 million (USD113.1 million) in April, a sharp reversal from March's surplus of AUD902
million and February's surplus of AUD1.73 billion. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics
imports rose 2% month on month (m/m) in April, with the bulk of the rise stemming from a 104% m/m
increase in imports of capital goods not elsewhere specified (n.e.s) and a 14% m/m jump in
telecommunications imports. Weaker growth of 3% and 2% m/m was recorded for consumption goods
and services imports, respectively. Exports slipped 1% m/m, with the only category to record growth
during the month being services (up AUD17 million). Weakness in receipts was largely concentrated in
rural goods and non-monetary gold receipts as they fell 6% and 11% m/m, respectively.

Receipts from top-export category non-rural goods fell AUD96 million as a 10% m/m rise in coal product
exports was offset by weakness in other non-rural goods exports.

Significance: The April trade data was a significant break from trend for both export and import
performance. The import story is likely to be a one-off issue caused by a major investment purchase for
a mining or energy sector project based on the jump in the n.e.s category of capital goods imports. IHS
otherwise expects imports to remain weak as the mining boom continues to unwind. The bigger question
at hand is whether exports will continue to underperform. Weaker iron ore prices and limited expected
growth in commodities prices will weigh on the outlook, but more significantly so will softer demand from
China. IHS continues to expect the country to record a merchandise-trade surplus worth under 1% of
GDP for 2014, but it may come in closer to 0.5% if Chinese demand for commodities weakens
significantly further.
