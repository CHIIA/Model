MARKET CLOSES HIGHER, LED BY THE BANKS ON NOMINAL VOLUME

Our market closed up 19.2 points to 5481.4 after trading up to a high of 5493 and a low of 5462.2 on low
volume. The banks led the way higher, but all sectors were mildly positive, however not much can be
read into a market where volume reached only $2.7 billion! Partly due to holidays in Japan and Hong
Kong.

The RBA's statement was in line with expectations. Victoria's budget in surplus and targeting a huge
infrastructure spend was cheering to a market fearing a downbeat, austerity focused Fed Budget.

There did not seem to be any major highlights among stocks.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was closed on holiday, Shanghai CSI physical was up 4.29 points
to 2031.64, Hang Seng futures was closed on holiday, S&P futures was up 2.9 points to 1878.70,
Nasdaq futures was up 5.5 points to 3596.25, Dow futures was up 26 points to 16,470 points.
Spot gold was steady at $1309. Crude was down 6c to $99.42.
