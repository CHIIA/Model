U.S. stocks rallied to fresh records on Thursday after the European Central Bank cut interest rates and
announced additional stimulus efforts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its seventh record close of 2014, adding 98.58 points, or
0.6%, to 16836.11.

The S&P 500 also hit a new high, gaining 12.58 points, or 0.7%, to 1940.46. All 10 of the S&P 500's
sectors advanced, led by gains industrial stocks. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 44.58 points, or
1%, to 4296.23.

The Russell 2000 Index of small stocks jumped 2% to close at its highest level in more than two months.

Shares rallied on both sides of the Atlantic after the ECB announced new actions to help prevent falling
prices from undermining the euro zone's recovery. It cut its main lending rate and introduced a so-called
negative deposit rate, in effect charging banks to park cash with the central bank to encourage investors
to seek higher returns elsewhere.

Additionally, the ECB said it was prepared to take other unconventional measures in the future.

The ECB's moves follow a series of stimulative policy steps from the Federal Reserve and Bank of
Japan, which have diminished the payout from government bonds and helped fuel demand for stocks in
recent years.

"What we saw today is another big central back deciding they are going to have to get the same
playbook" as the U.S. and Japan, said John Forlines III, chief investment officer at New York-based
JAForlines Global Investment Management, which directly manages about $500 million.

In a market environment helped by accommodative central-bank policies, "the grinding path" for "risk
assets is up," he said.

European stocks marked broad gains, as the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.4% to close at a 6 1/2-year
high. For weeks, U.S. investors have fixed their attention on the ECB meeting as a likely driver for price
swings. Many said that U.S. stocks were vulnerable to an underwhelming response from the central
bank.

"They delivered," said Chris Diaz, portfolio manager and global head of rates at Janus Capital Group,
which oversees about $174 billion. "I was worried about it: the institution has a history of
under-delivering when it comes to market expectations."

ECB policy changes came ahead of Friday's closely watched reading on the U.S. labor market.
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls will increase 210,000 in May. The unemployment rate is
expected to edge up to 6.4% from 6.3% in April.

in line with expectations of 310,000. A separate report on Wednesday showed private-sector payrolls in
the U.S. increased less than expected.

Mr. Forlines said that this week's jobs data might have less impact than in other months because the Fed
has made clear that it plans to keep interest rates low even as it unwinds its monthly asset-purchase
program this year. It would take a significant deviation to change market expectations, he said.
"The U.S. equity market, particularly the large-cap portion of it, looks very sturdy," he said. "If you're
looking for a catalyst down the road to crash it, there's not too much out there."

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked lower to 2.584% from 2.604% late Wednesday. The euro
briefly plunged to a four-month low versus the dollar before reversing course and turning higher.
Gold futures rose 0.7% to settle at $1,253.00 a troy ounce, while crude oil futures eased 0.2% to settle at
$102.48 a barrel.
Asian markets ended mostly higher. China's Shanghai Composite rallied 0.8% to snap a four-session
losing streak, while Japan's Nikkei Stock Average gained 0.1% to the highest close in nearly three
months.
Joy Global rose 6.7%, leading gains on the S&P 500, after the mining-equipment maker's quarterly profit
topped expectations.

Ciena climbed 18% after the telecom-equipment operator reported better-than-expected fiscal
second-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue and provided a revenue outlook for the current quarter
that was above analyst projections.
J.M. Smucker rose 1.4% after the company said that its quarterly profit fell 9% as lower coffee prices
weighed on sales, though the company's per-share earnings beat expectations.

Shares of General Motors fell 0.7% after the auto maker discussed on Thursday the internal probe of its
defective ignition switches, and revealed that 15 employees had been fired.
