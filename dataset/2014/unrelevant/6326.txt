Cbus Property has significantly boosted its apartment development pipeline with the acquisition of a
major site in Sydney's Epping. The price is understood to be about $85 million.
Epping, in Sydney's north-west is set to undergo a significant urban renewal. The site at 12 Langston
Place was sold by Phillip Wolanski's Denwol Group. Mr Wolanski would not comment.

The deal was brokered by CBRE's Ben Wicks and Nicholas Heaton.
Sources said the transaction, understood to have exchanged on Monday, brings Cbus's pipeline up
to about 1200 units. The site could accommodate 400 to 500 apartments but is not DA approved.
The site is in an area of more than 50 hectares in Epping rezoned by the NSW government for
housing and retail in March. Cbus also declined to comment.
Denwol has held the property for more than a decade. Currently it site has a four-storey office
building with more than 8787 square metres of space and more than 240 parking spaces.

It provides an immediate net income of more than $3.6 million from Westpac Banking Corporation,
and is leased until 2018.
But its potential for a high-density, mixed-use project means the site was highly sought after by
developers. The site was hotly contested with about nine or 10 bids. B1 Group, AV Jennings and
Galileo Japan Trust are all rumoured to have made offers for the Epping site. Elsewhere in Epping,
Goodman Group is selling its Cambridge Office Park, which has potential for about 500 apartments.
Competition is strong for apartment sites in Sydney. Chinese real estate giant R&F Properties,
Brookfield Multiplex, Fridcorp and Aqualand are just some of the names rumoured to be circling
Sydney assets.
Denwol Group, a boutique developer, has several other development projects in the works. One of
the most significant is the MEZZO Apartments in Glebe in Sydney. Denwol joined up with Oakstand
and LaSalle Investment Management for the 190 apartment and commercial development.
Denwol paid more than $50 million for the Bay Street development site measuring 6555 square
metres in 2013.

When they break ground in Glebe, it will not be first time the two groups have collaborated. Denwol
and Oakstand completed a Manly development with 38 townhouses and apartments called Spring
Cove which was released to the market in September. Nearly all the dwellings sold within the month.
