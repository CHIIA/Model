0405 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar has held above the critical support zone of US$0.9200 this
week, which affirms the view that there is more upside in the currency over time, says Commonwealth
Bank of Australia's global head of currency strategy, Richard Grace. With one eye on China's economy,
Australia's biggest trading partner, Grace expects further downturns in the country's property sector to
potentially rattle investor confidence and possibly cause some dips in the Australian dollar. However, he
isn't concerned about the strength of China's economy longer term, which will also underpin support for
the Australian dollar. The Aussie dollar is now at US$0.9313. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0405 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are lower amid lingering concerns over the Fed's
timing of potential rate hikes, says a local trader. Rising local shares are also weighing on local bonds.
The trader says most market participants remain cautious before Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet
Yellen's speech at the economics policymakers' meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later in the global
day. "But unless U.S. Treasurys fall sharply, the local bond market is likely to enter a consolidation
phase," he adds. The five-year bond yield rises to 1.1730% from 1.1605% late Thursday; the trader tips
the yield to trade between 1.1600% and 1.1800% for the session. The Taiex is 1.1% higher.

0404 GMT [Dow Jones] China's government still hasn't kicked its addiction to high-speed growth, says Li
Wenpu, an economist at Xiamen University. "The government has been too focused on stabilizing
economic growth in the short term, and doesn't have the energy to promote reform that's much needed
for the Chinese economy," says Mr. Li. If he's right, China's years of high-speed growth could soon
come to an end, as the country's capital-intensive growth model finally reaches its limits.

0403 GMT [Dow Jones] A cut in interest rates would do little to fix China's creaking financial system,
says Feng Jianlin, a former economist at the National Development and Reform Commission who now
runs his own firm, Beijing Fost Economic Consulting. "Small companies' borrowing rates from private
lenders are as high as 10%-20%," says Mr. Feng. "Can you say a 0.2% interest rate cut would help that
much? I don't think so." (richard.silk@dowjones.com)
0401 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares rise by midday break with banks stabilizing following recent
losses, say analysts. The Shanghai Composite Index rises 0.2% to 2235.80 and is tipped to be capped
at 2250. The market has consolidated for weeks and a breakthrough will need higher trading volume and
further gains in heavyweight stocks, such as banks, says Li Xiaoxuan, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities. Banks rise on bargain-hunting after recent losses; Bank of Beijing (601169.SH) climbs 1.4%
to CNY7.10. Strength in media firms continues; People.cn (603000.SH) adds 4.9% to CNY46.31. The
Shenzhen Composite Index gains 0.4% to 1228.88. (amy.li@dowjones.com)

0351 GMT [Dow Jones] The Reserve Bank of Australia will remain in a holding pattern until at least
mid-2015, says Paul Brennan, chief economist at Citigroup. A shift back to an easing bias, that markets

Page346of416©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.still see as likely, would require a significant further decline in inflation and rise in unemployment, he
adds. "[RBA Gov.] Stevens has set a high bar to changing from the neutral policy bias." Even though the
unemployment rate jumped to 6.4% in July, Stevens is of the view that "most leading indicators of the
labor market seem to have improved a little this year," he said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0345 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Agricole CIB believes the chance of a system-wide cut in China's reserve
requirement ratio, or RRR--the amount that banks must keep with the central bank--has increased to
35% from 25%. While CA CIB expects that July's dramatic drop in credit will turn out to be a monthly blip,
the parade of bad news of late increases pressure on Beijing to stimulate the economy with more fiscal
spending and a looser monetary policy, it said. Virtually every indicator other than exports was down in
July, including retail sales, industrial output, electricity consumption, electricity production, government
revenues, cargo traffic and imports.(Mark.Magnier@WSJ.com; Twitter at @MarkMagnier.)

0330 GMT [Dow Jones] The yuan is unexpectedly weaker for a second day despite the People's Bank of
China's benchmark daily rate set stronger vs. the U.S. dollar Friday. There has been a bout of yuan
selling for option-contract hedging owing to the yuan falling below 6.1500 in the offshore market, a trader
at an investment bank in Singapore says. Also, oil importers are said to have bought possibly around $2
billion in the onshore market during the closing minutes of Thursday's session leaving interbank dealers
caught short at Friday's opening, he says. Dealers are playing it safe and squaring up shorts because of
the chances of being caught off guard by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's
post-Jackson Hole statement, the trader says. USD/CNY is now 6.1595 from its Thursday close of
6.1514. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0328 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian corporate results so far this earnings period have generated more
downgrades than upgrades by Citi analysts, according to an analysis by the broker. Of the 152
companies covered by Citi, 77 had reported their results by Thursday. Citi analysts subsequently
downgraded their ratings for 10% of those companies, while upgrading just 3%. FY15 EPS estimates
were downgraded for 25% of the companies covered, almost double the percentage of upgrades. In
terms of FY14 earnings, 17% were above expectations, and 17% were below. Reactions from Citi
analysts have been overwhelmingly neutral, albeit more negative than positive. S&P/ASX 200 last up
0.3% at 5667. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0306 GMT [Dow Jones] A business investment recovery in Australia is set to be a story for 2015, not
2014, says Paul Brennan, chief economist at Citigroup. Non-mining business investment will pick up
more solidly by the second half of next year, by which time revenue growth should be stronger than it is
currently so that companies won't need to focus as much on cost savings, he said. Still, mining
investment will be a drag on economic growth next year of around of 1 percentage point of GDP growth
as some large gas projects are completed. "We continue to expect only a mild acceleration in growth
during next year," Brennan added. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0303 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is up 0.1% at 15598.71 midday on continuing thin volume. The
broader Topix is weaker however, after falling the prior session as well. "There is still some buying in
undervalued and so-called laggard sectors such as banks and brokerages, but overall a lack of trading
incentives, combined with reticence before (U.S. Fed Chairwoman) Yellen's speech is enough to keep
people out of the market," says an equity trading director at a European brokerage. Trading volume is
just 865 million shares--on pace for one of the lightest tallies of the year. SoftBank (9984.TO) is up 0.6%
at Y7,399 and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.TO) leads banks, up 0.5% at Y604. The Topix is
down 0.1% at 1290.57. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesian shares trade 0.1% lower at 5201 early Friday, not obviously affected
by an after-hours court ruling on Thursday evening that cleared the way for president-elect Joko Widodo,
or Jokowi, to set up a government. Election runner-up Prabowo Subianto had challenged the election
result, but Indonesia's constitutional court rejected the move. Despite the slow start to Friday's trading,
analysts remain upbeat. "We expect [the] market to stay positive today," Trimegah Securities says,
adding that the court's decision was widely expected. Early gainers include PT Indofood CBP Sukses
Makmur (ICBP.JK), up 0.5%, while large-cap losers are led by PT United Tractors (UNTR.JK), down
1.1%. (jake.watts@wsj.com; @jmwatts_)
