issues higher and 591 down. The SPI Futures fell 34 points to 5491 on light volume of 16,733 contracts.
Aussie 10 year bond yields were down 10 points to 3.7%. The $A is at 93.50US c, down about 30 points
from last evening.

*The banks contributed 12.2 negative points to the index, insurers contributed 1.6 negative points,
resources contributed 5.7 negative points, property trusts contributed 1 positive point, retailers
contributed 1 negative point and Telstra was Neutral.

*Over the week the market held on to an 18.2 point or 0.3% gain.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 240 points to 14,060 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
down 8.42 points to 2016.56, Hang Seng futures was down 78 points to 22,472 points. S&P futures were

Spot gold was down $1 to $1296. Crude was up 38c to $101.88.
Markets were down in Asia on a variety of factors including the Ukraine and China/Vietnam situations -
on a "risk off" scenario. In our market there also seems to have been significant switching into bonds on
a flight to safety.

Global markets - at or near their highs - are becoming increasingly nervous since the lift in their
sharemarkets are not indications of booming economies but represent a flight of money into handfuls of
high yielding and safe stocks.

Small companies and those in development as illustrated by the US Russell 2000 and our multitude of
explorers, biotechs and hi techs are generally starved of cash.

"Ceiling will be 5499. Floor will be 5448. Close at 5470, down 40.8 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with the
local futures contract down 29 points.

"It is likely that global equities have commenced the near-term moderate decline that I have been looking
for.
While I can't rule out one last marginal high here, most equity markets are begging to test their
March/April lows sooner rather than later.

"I don't have a particular target in mind for our market but a test of the March low would be quite
reasonable. Once this pullback is complete, markets should commence their final run higher amongst a
backdrop of bullish enthusiasm from market pundits and technicians.

Page72of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Only by looking below the surface can one see the dangerous rip tide that has formed in the form of
multiple internal bearish divergences. Now to be fair, internal divergences do not always lead to
significant declines. But from a statistical viewpoint, a significant decline is more likely than not.

"I still have our market visiting circa 4300 or lower. While this would seem impossible to many, the current
divergences are of the same magnitude and duration as that witnessed heading into market peaks in
2007 and 2011.

"Don't say you were not warned!

"Today, the ceiling will be 5499. The floor will be 5448. When the dust has settled, the market will have
closed at 5470, down 40.8 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 14.3 points to 5510.8 last evening.

GLNG and PNG LNG are fully ramped up its LNGexports will increase from 300,000 tonnes per annum to

years and deliver long term energy security for Australian businesses and consumers, as well as to
international customers. Santos has the largest exploration and production acreage in Australia.
Santos is also steadily growing its Asian portfolio of assets. Its onshore and offshore oil and gas projects
in Australia and across South East Asia put the company in a strong position to deliver between 80-90
million barrels of oil equivalent production by 2020 vs 51 million barrels produced in 2013.

maintaining the dividend in line with the company's cash and earnings capacity. It has around $845
million in franking credits that belong to shareholders.

share buybacks. At this stage Santos sees no reason to discontinue its dividend reinvestment plan or
reduce the level of discount.

other countries.

supplies with its coal seam gas exploration at Narrabri the managing director pointed to the rigorous

*MEL: Further announcement re. suspension of Rosella/referral to ICAC

Metgasco Ltd advised the decision of the NSW Government to suspend its Rosella exploration drilling
program came without any warning, months after exploration well commitments were made and within a
short period of mobilising the drilling rig for the program.

The Government's reason for the suspension relates to its community consultation program but the
suspension letter provides little explanation of what the company should have done that it did not do.

Metgasco is seeking to have the government withdraw the suspension to allow the well to proceed.
Without immediate lift of the suspension, Metgasco will suffer substantial costs.

Metgasco is also not aware of any matter involving its conduct, its staff or its shareholders that would
constitute grounds for an investigation by ICAC.

Metgasco remains in a trading halt.
