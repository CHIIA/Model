Release date - 24072014
Atlas Iron Limited (ASX: AGO) is pleased to advise it has exceeded its production guidance and achieved
its cash cost guidance for the year to June 30, 2014.

Atlas shipped 3.1Mt (WMT) during the June 2014 Quarter to achieve a total of 10.9Mt at a C1 cash cost of
A$51/t for FY2014.

Atlas Managing Director Ken Brinsden said the results were strong given the tough market conditions.
‘These results highlight Atlas’ ability to not only endure what has unquestionably been a difficult market in
recent months, but also to grow despite this environment,’ Mr. Brinsden said.

‘The Mt Webber Project is now in production, with ramp up underway, and Stage 2 on track to further
increase overall North Pilbara production by the end of this year. The development of the Mt Webber Mine,
a 10-year, 6Mt per annum operation, has been funded with FY2014’s operating cash flow and some to
spare, placing Atlas in a position of strength.’

Atlas had A$265M cash on hand at 30 June 2014 after investing A$108M in growth projects during the
June 2014 Quarter, with a large portion of those funds contributing to progress at the recently
commissioned Mt Webber mine. This included significant inventory build-up and provision of loan finance
to assist Altura Mining Limited to fund its share of project investment.

Atlas shipped 3.1Mt (WMT) for the June 2014 Quarter, 2.8Mt of Standard Fines and 0.3Mt of Value Fines.
The June 2014 Quarter was one of reliable and strong performance across all production activities from
the mine to port with new monthly records set for processing, haulage and shipping. Consistent
performance at Abydos (3.8Mtpa annualised), and Wodgina (5.9Mtpa), combined with the continuation of
processing of excess ore tones from Wodgina at Mt Dove (2.7Mtpa annualised), supported a 12Mtpa
production rate over three consecutive months in the June 2014 Quarter.

A continued focus on costs and production performance has achieved planned C1 operating costs for the
June 2014 Quarter with cash operating cost guidance for FY2014 of A$49 - 52/t (wet basis, FOB, and
excluding royalties) also being achieved. Full year cash operating cost achieved for FY2014 is estimated
at $51/t.
All-in cash costs to China improved markedly after a weather affected March 2014 Quarter, with delivered
costs for the June 2014 Quarter of A$75/wmt CFR (US$70/wmt). Finished product stock levels at the port
and sites have increased during the quarter. Quarter on Quarter there has been a significant increase in
Run of Mine stocks (ROM), driven predominantly by ROM stock build at Mt Webber in readiness for
commencement of processing operations.

Atlas will continue to supplement North Pilbara production during the September 2014 Quarter by using
existing crushing capacity at Mt Dove to process additional mine material from Wodgina, in parallel to the
ramp up of Mt Webber production.

Marketing

Pricing during the June 2014 Quarter fell significantly, with the Platts 62% Fe IODEX averaging
US$102.57 compared with US$120.39 for the March 2014 Quarter. The price fall resulted primarily from

Page178of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.the rapid expansion of iron ore supply into China (particularly from major Australian producers) and
restrictions in credit availability in China.
This impact from the fall in iron ore price was compounded by increased discounts being offered in the
market by some major producers and the strengthening Australian dollar, which have collectively resulted
in lower AUD realised prices.
Atlas’ average headline sale price for tonnes delivered during the June 2014 Quarter was US$78 CFR
DMT (March 2014 Quarter US$103), which was adjusted to US$74 after recognising provisional pricing
movements from cargos delivered in the March 2014 Quarter, but priced in the June 2014 Quarter.

The average price for Value Fines tonnes delivered during the March 2014 Quarter was US$63 CFR DMT
(March 2013 Quarter US$78), which was adjusted to US$62 after recognising provisional pricing
movements from cargos delivered in the March 2014 Quarter, but priced in the June 2014 Quarter.

The March 2014 Quarter pricing adjustments represent a negative $15M adjustment that has been
recognised in the June 2014 Quarter. In addition to impacting on results from prior periods, Quotation
Period adjustments also impact on intra quarter pricing outcomes, for example all bar one April cargos
were priced on May or June averages, when pricing was significantly lower than the month of delivery.

The impact of this on a quarterly and yearly basis is illustrated in the charts below. In Quarters where price
trends upwards the reverse effect will occur such that an annual average relativity to index is achieved.

Atlas considers that both the headline index price and discounts have declined below their true market
equilibrium point and that this trend will correct itself in coming months as the market absorbs new supply
and high cost production exits the market.

The average grade for Standard Fines shipped for the June 2014 Quarter was 56.60% Fe. The average
grade for Value Fines for the June 2014 Quarter was 53.31% Fe. During the June 2014 Quarter Atlas
entered iron ore hedges totaling 250,000 tonnes which will settle during July and August 2014 at prices
ranging from US$93.75 to US$96.00 basis 62% Fe.

Projects

Atlas’ investment in its Pilbara assets continued during the June 2014 Quarter, with a total of
approximately A$91M progressing mine development and capitalised exploration. From the first quarter of
FY2015 capital investment falls away markedly as Atlas’ investment in new mine assets and infrastructure
winds-down. Please see Atlas’ ‘FY15 Production and Cost Guidance’ release to the ASX of 24th July,
2014 for further details.

HORIZON 1 PROJECTS

Mt Webber - Stage 1

Stage 1 of the Mt Webber project is now complete and the mine was formally opened on 15 July 2014 by
the Minister for Mines, Hon Bill Marmion, with ramp up underway.

Production at the project is commencing at a nominal rate of 3Mtpa and is expected to ramp up to 6Mtpa
following the commissioning of the second phase expansion by the end of the December 2014 Quarter.

Mt Webber - Stage 2

Good progress has been made with the development of the Mt Webber Stage 2 project during the June
2014 Quarter, with the project running ahead of schedule. The Stage 2 crushing circuit is expected to be
commissioned during the December Quarter 2014, with ramp up over the March 2015 Quarter.

All environmental approvals have been secured for Stage 2 of the Mt Webber project. Atlas is also pleased
to advise that the total cost for the combined stages of the Mt Webber project are tracking below the
estimated total cost of A$212M, inclusive of contributions towards regional road upgrades. Of this amount
A$163M has already been incurred as at 30 June 2014.
Gross Mine Capex - partially funded by Atlas JV Partner, Altura Mining Ltd, under JV terms. Refer to the
ASX Announcement dated 8 July 2013 for further information.

Abydos

While Abydos is now in full production, works continued during the June 2014 Quarter on final
infrastructure and accommodation facilities which are now completed.

McPhee Creek

The McPhee Creek Mine and Rail pre-feasibility study has been finalised and will be presented to the
Board for consideration. Feasibility works during the period focused on integrating Atlas’ regional
development options in the corridor between Mt Webber, Corunna Downs and McPhee Creek, to future
proof any infrastructure solution by considering:
the ability to incorporate the full exploration potential along the banded iron formation between Corunna
Downs and McPhee Creek;

the provision of a regional blending capability, which appears to be a combined product value enhancer
that is unlikely to be achievable at Port Hedland for the currently envisaged rail solutions and

the overall capital efficiency of the chosen solution and ability to stage capital inputs to infrastructure and
mine development.

As part of the additional feasibility work, a hub proposal, potentially with centralised processing, has been
assessed as enabling regional tonnes to be aggregated and blended, before being dispatched by rail to
Port Hedland.

SE Pilbara

Active work on SE Pilbara opportunities is on hold pending finalisation of the rail haulage solution and as
such projects are now scheduled later in Atlas’ project pipeline.

Rail and Port

Discussions pertaining to third-party rail haulage negotiations have continued to progress during the June
2014 Quarter and Atlas is working to enter final agreements as soon as possible. Confidentiality
arrangements are in place and commercial interests associated with the discussions prevent Atlas from
elaborating further on the negotiations at this stage.

In addition to Atlas’ right to up to 15Mtpa of capacity at the existing Utah Point port, Atlas also holds a 63%
interest in North West Infrastructure (NWI), which has an allocation of 50Mtpa of export capacity within
South-West Creek in Port Hedland’s inner harbour. NWI remains actively engaged with the State
authorities to finalise lease arrangements.

Horizon II Partnering

Atlas continues to undertake preliminary discussions with a number of parties who have expressed interest
in becoming project development partners for its Horizon II asset suite. A formal process to facilitate the
progress of these transactions is expected to commence in the current Quarter.

Exploration and Resource Geology

During the June 2014 Quarter exploration was focused at the Corunna Downs and Mt Webber projects.
Overall 283 RC drill holes were completed for 22,278m underpinning a resource upgrade at Corunna
Downs provided to the market. In addition 755m of diamond drilling for QAQC and geotechnical purposes
completed at Corunna Downs will support further Resource Estimation and Studies works. Atlas invested
A$6M on total exploration during the June 2014 Quarter.

Corunna Downs

The mineral resource at Corunna Downs doubled to 51Mt at 57.3% Fe during the June 2014 Quarter.

Subsequent to the end of the June 2014 Quarter Atlas announced excellent drilling results from the
recently discovered ‘Glen Herring’ prospect, further demonstrating the potential of its 100% owned
Corunna Downs Project, in the North Pilbara.
The new results include thick intersections of low phosphorus, low alumina DSO at the northern end of the
emerging Corunna Downs corridor, outside of the current resource and exploration target area including:

142m @ 58.45% Fe, 5.81% SiO2, 1.00% Al2O3 and 0.074% P in CDRC0366;

138m @ 59.32% Fe, 5.01% SiO2, 1.12% Al2O3 and 0.054% P in CDRC0371 (including 112m @ 61.05%
Fe 2.98% SiO2, 0.74% Al2O3 and 0.058% P);

Page180of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.116m @ 58.55% Fe, 6.14% SiO2, 0.88% Al2O3 and 0.066% P in CDRC0364 and

96m @ 59.71% Fe, 4.52% SiO2, 0.95% Al2O3 and 0.046% P in CDRC0365.

The results show that Corunna Downs has the potential to grow beyond current expectations.

During the June 2014 Quarter Atlas purchased 100% of exploration licence E45/4100 for $222,000 plus a
1% gross revenue royalty from Gondwana Resources Ltd. The tenement will form part of Atlas’ wider
Corunna Downs project area.

Miralga Creek

During the June 2014 Quarter exploration success continued at the Miralga Creek Project which is
adjacent to Atlas’ existing Abydos Mine. Finalisation of initial Miralga Creek resource estimates are
planned for the September 2014 Quarter.

Corporate

Cost Initiatives

During FY2014 Atlas embarked on a number of cost saving initiatives with the aim of significantly reducing
the total cost of delivering iron ore tonnes to the market. The initiatives predominantly target Atlas’
operational cost base but also aim to reduce corporate, project development and exploration spend. See
ASX ‘FY15 Production and Cost Guidance’ announcement of 24 July 2014 for further information on these
initiatives.

Cash Position and Debt

Cash as at 30 June 2014 was A$265M after investment in growth projects of A$108M, including the
funding of the Mt Webber project inclusive of the required inventory build and financing of the Altura
Mining Limited loan to assist them fund their share of the project.
Following the introduction of the Mining Rehabilitation Fund by the Department of Mines and Petroleum
on 1 July 2014 the Company anticipates receiving $18M during the September 2014 Quarter following the
cancellation of performance bonds and associated release of funds required to ‘cash back’ these bonds.
The $18M is not included in the cash balance of $265M recorded at 30 June 2014.
Atlas’ ‘Term Loan B’ Debt facility of US$271M is fully drawn. Other finance facilities of A$104M available to
the Company are drawn to the extent of $14M at balance date.

Taxation Matters
Following the takeover of Giralia Resources in 2011 Atlas claimed a tax deduction of $835 million for
tenements that were acquired and first used for exploration purposes. Atlas has proactively engaged with
the ATO to confirm the claim and during the June 2014 Quarter received confirmation that the deduction is
available and the claimed value of $835M continues to form part of Atlas’ carried forward tax loss pool.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

During the June 2014 Quarter changes were made to the Atlas Rules of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(DRP). The changes were made to reflect recent amendments in the ASX Listing Rules which came into
effect in April 2014.

Centaurus Metals Limited (Centaurus)
Atlas holds a 21.34% strategic interest in Centaurus, an emerging Brazilian iron ore explorer and
developer.

Shaw River Manganese Limited (Shaw River)

Atlas holds a 53.45% strategic interest in Shaw River, a manganese exploration and development
company.
