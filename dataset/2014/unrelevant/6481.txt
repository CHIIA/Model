China's Shenhua Group has dropped out of the running for New South Wales's biggest power
company, Macquarie Generation, leaving three parties likely to submit final offers early next month.

It is understood Shenhua notified the NSW government that it was pulling out of the due diligence
process in late December, after earlier attending management meetings and site tours.

Sources said little reason was given for the sudden change of heart, although Shenhua, advised by
Macquarie Capital and Morgan Stanley, must have thought the auction was either too hot or the asset
too poor for the price expectations.
It leaves AGL Energy, advised by Citi and Lazard, UBS-advised ERM Power and Credit Suisse-led
Marubeni Corporation as the three remaining contenders.
It is understood Marubeni has taken another Asian equity partner into its bidding group, while some
sources also believe ERM Power has bolstered its consortiums.

NSW Treasurer Mike Baird, advised by Goldman Sachs, has said he wants a deal at or close to
MacGen's $2 billion book value, although bidders have been hopeful of a bargain buy.

MacGen is home to two NSW power plants, Bayswater and Liddell, which together account for 29 per
cent of the state's contribution to the national electricity market.
The privatisation is to be closely followed by another electricity asset sale, Delta Coastal, with
expressions of interest due on February 4.

While it's only early days, Delta's peaking power station, Colongra, is likely to attract the attention of
the major power retailers AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia.
