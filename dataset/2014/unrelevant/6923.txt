MD SAYS THE KUD 1525-26 DRILL RESULTS VERY EXCITING

Sydney - Monday - March 24: (RWE Australian Business News) - Panoramic Resources has reported
that the down-hole electromagnetic (EM) survey of Savannah North discovery hole KUD1525 has been
completed and the preliminary interpretation report received from Newexco Services.

Panoramic's managing director, Peter Harold, said: "The EM results from drillholes KUD1525 and KUD
1526 are very exciting and suggest mineralisation could extend over a significant area.

"The priority now is to finish the next underground hole (drillhole KUD1527 is targeting the predicted
position of the Savannah Intrusion and ore body above the 500 Fault) and then commence the surface
drilling program.

"We had initially planned to utilise one drill rig; however, with the very positive EM result we may
consider mobilising a second surface rig to site," Mr Harold declared.

The Newexco report is part of the EM program, drillhole KUD1526 was also surveyed.

The discovery zone of mineralisation in KUD1525 was 89.3m at 1.60% Ni, 0.76% Cu and 0.12% Co
from 704.9m and interpreted to lie in a faulted offset position north of the mine between the 900 and 500
Faults.

The intersection places the mineralisation approximately 650m to the north and 300m below the depth of
the current decline position.

The interpretation of the KUD1525 EM survey data indicates that the KUD1525 assay intersection is part
of a substantial conductor, consistent with a complex, highly conductive bedrock source that extends
from 400m down-hole to near the end of hole (EOH) at 972.7m, a distance of 570m.

At about 400-450m down hole, the top edge of the conductor corresponds to a mine grid northing of
2250mN, which is 325m north of the 1675 Drill Cuddy.

Based on the position of the 900 Fault intersected in KUD1526, the top edge on the conductor is
interpreted at mine level 1300mRL.

The Newexco report also notes that the very high modelled conductance (5500S) of the anomaly
ensures that the source will be visible to future drilling and EM from several hundred metres away.

Support for the KUD1525 interpretation is provided by the EM survey of KUD1526, which was EM
surveyed from 20m to 535m (EOH 539.7m).

Hole KUD1526 was also drilled to the north from the 1675 Drill Cuddy, but at a steeper dip than
KUD1525 in order to intersect and position the 900 Fault.

KUD1526 did not intersect any significant mineralisation.

The EM data for KUD1526 shows a broad, highly conductive (150-200 milli-second time constant)
offhole conductor located above left of the hole towards KUD1525.

conductor at 350m downhole and continuing to build towards the end of the survey at 538m downhole.

The EM survey data for KUD1525 and KUD1526 is considered very significant and demonstrates, in
conjunction with previously reported KUD1525 intersection, the potential for a large footprint of
Savannah magmatic breccia-style +/- Ni-Cu-Co mineralisation to be present between the 900 and 500
Fault structures north of the existing mine.

BACKGROUND

----------
Panoramic Resources Ltd is an established Western Australian mining company operating two
100%-owned underground nickel sulphide mines, the Savannah Project in East Kimberley and the
Lanfranchi Project near Kambalda.
The company joined the ASX list in September 2001.

On a group basis, Panoramic produced 19,561t of contained nickel in FY2013 and is expecting to
produce between 21,000 and 21,500t of contained nickel in FY2014.
Panoramic is an S&P/ASX 300 Index company with solid balance sheet, no bank debt and a growing
nickel, gold and PGM resource base, employing more than 400 people (including contractors).
In early 2011, Panoramic acquired the Gidgee Gold Project, located near Wiluna.

Panoramic subsequently acquired the high-grade Wilsons Project, located within the Gidgee tenement
package, as well as a 70% interest in the Mt Henry Gold Project.
It released a Scoping Study in August 2012 on the restart of gold production from Gidgee and released
a positive Scoping Study on the Mt Henry Project in December 2012.

Technical studies for the Mt Henry Bankable Feasibility Study have commenced.
The company has expanded into Platinum Group Metals (PGM) with the purchase of the Panton PGM
Project located 60km south of the Savannah Project in the East Kimberley and the Thunder Bay North
PGM Project in Northern Ontario, Canada.
The company's vision is to broaden its exploration and production base, with the aim of becoming a
major, diversified mining company in the S&P/ASX 100 Index.
