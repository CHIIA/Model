Hong Kong developer Golden Horse Holdings is now eyeing a Sydney golf course, hot off the heels
of its $380 million purchase of a Goodman Group asset in Sydney – one of the biggest residential
single site deals in Australian history.
The head of the offshore group, Feng Di, is in due diligence to buy the Twin Creeks championship
18-hole golf course in western Sydney.

Golden Horse, which has a local arm called GH Properties, already has a significant real estate
business in Australia. Earlier in November it entered the Sydney market with the $380 million buy of
Ashmore Estate, a seven hectare site in Erskinville that could yield more than 1700 apartments.
The vendor, Goodman Group, is waiting until certain conditions are met until confirming the deal.
Colliers International's Michael Crombie brokered the transaction but declined to comment when
contacted by The Australian Financial Review.
Golden Horse last year snapped up the Links Hope Island Golf Club on the Gold Coast from
Queensland developer Consolidated Properties for about $12 million with the aim of building a hotel.
In January, it bought the Noosa Springs Golf Resort and housing development site. Golden Horse is
also planning a 251 apartment tower in Brisbane.
Mr Feng also owns a 54-hole golf resort in Guangzhou in southern China called Guangzhou Dragon
Lake Golf Club. The pricing of the Twin Creeks golf course, which is co-owned by AMP Capital,
Marsim and Crownland Developments , is not known.
AMP confirmed the asset had been for sale but would not comment further on the transaction.
