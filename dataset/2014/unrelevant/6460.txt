SYDNEY, May 16 (Reuters) - Singapore edible oils giant Wilmar International and First Pacific Co are
poised to buy Australian bread and dairy companyGoodman Fielder for A$1.37 billion ($1.28 billion)
after the target backed a sweetened takeover bid on Friday.

In a statement late on Friday, Goodman chairman Steve Gregg said the company's board will
unanimously recommend the offer in the absence of a better one.
Late on Thursday Wilmar - which already owns 10 percent of Goodman - and First Pacific, a Hong
Kong investment firm, raised their offer from a A$1.27 billion bid rebuffed by Goodman last month.
The pair said Goodman's top two shareholders agreed to sell down their stakes by 4.8 percent.

The higher offer came with a condition that Goodman must agree to it within 24 hours. It also offered
shareholders a dividend of A$0.01 per share.
