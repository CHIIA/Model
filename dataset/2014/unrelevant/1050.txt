Perth, Feb 26
Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill iron ore project is close to finalising a $US7.8B
financing deal, a vital step towards an end-2015 start for the giant mine in Western Australia's iron-rich
Pilbara district.

The 55Mtpa project, which would make Roy Hill Australia's fourth-largest iron ore producer, will add to
hefty new supplies coming on line from Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group.
It should also add to the wealth of mining magnate Rinehart, already Australia's richest person with a
$17.7B fortune, according to Forbes.

"The agreement is not completely settled yet," said one source with direct knowledge of the
negotiations. “All the views have to be gathered as there are a lot of stakeholders.

“But as of now I don't see any problems, and a March signing looks likely.”

The start for the project, which includes a 344km rail line and port facilities, has been pushed back
amid delays in finalising equity partners and debt funding. Roy Hill initially targeted an end-2014 start
to production.

"According to current plans, first shipment is expected in the latter half of 2015," the source said.

“It can be understood as a trial run just before construction is expected to be completed by end-2015.”

A second source said the total included a working capital facility of about $A600M and around $US3B
from commercial banks.
Six other sources identified a group of 14 banks from Australia, Japan, China and Europe who were
financing the deal. Included in the financing is a yuan tranche provided by Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China and Bank of China to pay for equipment from China, one of those sources said.

The sources declined to be identified because of confidentiality clauses and because the deal has not
been finalised.

Roy Hill was not immediately available to comment.

EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES

Export credit agencies including Export-Import Bank of the US, Export Import Bank of Korea, Japan
Bank for International Cooperation and Nippon Export & Investment Insurance are backing Roy Hill
with guarantees and direct loans, the sources said.

Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting owns 70% of the project, with Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp
holding 15%, South Korean steel giant POSCO with 12.5% and Taiwan's China Steel Corp 2.5%.
Together, the owners have committed $A3.2B in equity to the project.

Boeing 737 aircraft.

Villages have been completed to house 3,600 construction workers and 2,000 operational staff on site
and at Port Hedland, as has dredging for its two deep-water berths at the port, Australia's biggest iron
ore terminal.

Roy Hill has so far been able to avoid the cost blowouts that plagued other resource projects in
Western Australia during the height of the mining investment boom a few years ago.
After four years of delays and billions of dollars of budget blowouts, CITIC Pacific made its first
shipment of iron ore concentrate from its $10B Sino Iron project in the Pilbara in December.

Roy Hill is likely to be the last new project of its scale to get off the ground, given worries over shaky
underlying demand for iron ore in China.
Other miners are rethinking expansion and cutting costs as iron ore prices drop. At just below $120/t
<.IO62-CNI=SI> on Wednesday, prices have fallen more than 11% so far this year and are down
almost 40%from a record high of $200 reached in February. Reuters
