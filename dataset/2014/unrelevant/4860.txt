The Board of Directors approved the 2014 first-half results at its 29 July
2014
meeting.
Commenting on these results, Jean-Louis Chaussade, Chief Executive Officer,
made the following statement:
"SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT has posted solid performance in the first half of the
year,
in line with annual set objectives. The Water Europe division is growing
strongly, benefiting from very significant increases in prices and volumes.
Waste Europe activities are steady in a very uneven industrial production
country by country in Europe. Lastly, activities in North America, Asia, and
Africa-India-Middle East are up, driven by sustained commercial dynamism.
Degrémont activity is down, but has improved in the second quarter and the
outlook for contracts coming into force is positive.
The beginning of 2014 was also marked by major developments with the upcoming

Page6of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.entry of La Caixa Group into our capital in exchange for the acquisition of
the
remaining 24.14% stake in Agbar, the increase in our equity interest in ACEA
and the strengthening of our positions in industrial water with the
acquisition
of Process Group. These transactions show SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT's desire to
accelerate its growth.
On the strength of these sound results and promising developments, SUEZ
ENVIRONNEMENT reaffirms its annual targets." (4)

2014 HALF-YEAR RESULTS
* REVENUE
Group revenue at 30 June 2014 was EUR6,891 million, down -2.1% (-EUR149m)
versus 30 June 2013, that breaks down as follows:
- Organic change +0.8% (+EUR53m):
* Water Europe: +3.6% (+EUR78m)
* Waste Europe: -0.1% (-EUR4m)
* International: -1.2% (-EUR20m)

- External growth -0.5% (-EUR34m), mainly reflecting the sale of sites in the
United Kingdom in September 2013 and the entry of Aguas de Sabadell in July
2013.

- Adverse exchange rate impact -2.4% (-EUR168m), due to the rise of the euro
against the Australian dollar (-EUR68m), the Chilean peso (-EUR61m) and the
US dollar (-EUR15m).
* OPERATING PERFORMANCE
EBITDA was EUR1,326 million at 30 June 2104, including a EUR129 million gain
on
the sale of CEM(5), representing organic growth of +1.6%. EBITDA in the Water
Europe division was up +9.0% in organic terms, benefiting from higher volumes
in Spain and Chile and favourable price indexations in all regions. The Waste
Europe division was down -1.1% in organic terms, mainly due to the adverse
effect of decreasing prices of secondary raw materials and electricity, and
the
strengthening of local competition, especially in Poland and the Netherlands.
The International division posted organic change of -0.9% (+10.5% when
restated
for the commercial renegotiation effect of the Sydney drinking water
distribution contract from Q2 2013).
Group EBITDA margin was 19.2% versus 17.5% in the first half of 2013.
Excluding
the CEM capital gain, the EBITDA margin rate is 17.4%.
In the first half of 2014, the Compass cost reduction program contributed
EUR60m, mainly by optimizing operational performance, procurement and by
reducing overhead.
EBIT(6) was EUR658 million, up +1.9% in organic terms.
Income from operating activities, including the share of income from equity

Page7of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.associates, was up +19.2% to EUR653 million. This includes the EUR65 million
gain from the fair value revaluation of Acea shares held as of 1 January 2014
after taking significant influence in the company, as well as some
restructuring costs and provisions for -EUR79 million.
* NET INCOME
Net financial income was a -EUR212 million in the first half of 2014, versus
-EUR193 million in the same period the previous year. Average debt maturity
was
extended to 6.9 years and average cost of debt was 4.43%(7); it benefited from
decrease in interest rates and an active debt management strategy.
Tax expense was -EUR59 million in the first half of 2014, versus -EUR82
million
in the same period the previous year. Effective tax rate is 23.3% versus 25.8%
for the first 2013 semester. This was mainly due to the fact that many
operating
companies are based in countries with lower tax rates than France, and due to
the revaluation of Acea's previously held shares, with no tax impact.
(5) Taking into account the new definition of EBITDA adopted by the Group and
the impact of the new IFRS 10 & 11 standards, the capital gain from the sale
of
CEM by SFH, an equity associate, is included in EBITDA.
(6) Current operating income (EBIT) including the share of income from equity
associates in the extension of the Group's activity.
(7) Excluding securitization costs and inflation linked debt cost in Chile
Income from non-controlling interests was EUR108 million.
Accordingly, net income Group share was up sharply at +EUR280 million, versus
+EUR132 million for the same period the previous year.

FREE CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET

Free cash flow was EUR215 million in the first half of 2014, up slightly on
the
same period the previous year.
Net investment amounted to EUR497 million. SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT strives to
accelerate the pace of investment to ensure its future growth. Accordingly,
financial investments are up sharply after acquiring Process Group and taking
an additional 3.95% stake in ACEA.
Net financial debt was EUR7,295 million at 30 June 2014. This was EUR503
million
less than at 30 June 2013 and slightly higher, by EUR109 million, than at 31
December 2013. The dividend payment of EUR479 million in the first half of the
year was partially offset by the securitization of a financial receivable
linked
to the commissioning of the Clermond-Ferrand energy-from-waste recovery plant
in
the amount of EUR212 million, and a new issue of undated deeply subordinated
notes in the net amount of EUR183 million. The net debt/ EBITDA ratio improved
to 2.8x, versus 3.1x(8) as of 30 June 2013, and remains below the annual
target
of 3x.
Lastly, it has to be noted that net debt at the end of June 2014 does not
include the proceeds from the CEM disposal, received on 15 July 2014 for
+EUR224 million, nor the anticipated disbursement related to the strengthened
partnership with La Caixa Group for -EUR200 million.
Moody's financial rating agency has confirmed, in May 2014, SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT
COMPANY A3 with rating stable outlook.

Revenue
EBITDA
* The Water Europe division posted an organic growth of +3.6% at 30 June 2014
with revenue of EUR2,207 million. Activity in the first half of the year
benefited from favourable price effect in France (+1.2%), Spain (+3.2%(9)) and
Chile (+7.3%). Volumes of drinking water sold rose in Spain (+0.4%) and Chile
(+3.1%), but declined in France (-0.9%), in line with the long-term trend.
The contribution of net commercial activity, both in public service delegation
contracts and in new services, was positive (+EUR25 million). Sales drives
continued in the first half of the year with numerous contracts won and
renewed
such as Versailles-Saint Cloud (c. EUR250m, 12 years), Cayenne (EUR34m, 12
years,), Orange (EUR16m, 12 years) in France, and the Navarra Canal (EUR70m,
30 years) in Spain.
(8) Based on reported accounts
(9) Excluding the increase in local taxes and revenue for third parties; the
total price rise is 6.9%.
* EBITDA was EUR607 million with a margin of 27.5%, versus 26.9% in the same
period the previous year. The strong organic growth of +9.0% reflects higher
volumes and prices as well as very effective cost control. The Water Europe
division generated EUR19 million in Compass savings over the six-month period.

Revenue
EBITDA
* The Waste Europe division posted revenue of EUR3,137 million, steady in
organic terms. Treated volumes increased by +1.2%, benefiting from the start
of
new treatment facilities (Clermont- Ferrand and South Tyne & Wear,
off-balance-sheet assets), but macroeconomic conditions remain difficult in
Europe.
The positive effect of rising volumes was partly offset by declining prices of
secondary raw materials (ferrous metals down by 7%, paper down by 6% and
electricity down by EUR20 per MWh in France) and of services (especially in
Poland and the Netherlands affected by strong competition).
Geographically, the organic change was +0.2% in France, +1,8% in the United
Kingdom and Scandinavia, -0.9% in Benelux/Germany, and -11.8% in Central
Europe.
* Sales were strong in the first half of 2014 supported by new or renewed
contracts, especially in energy or material waste recovery such as Le Havre
(EUR180m, 10 years) and Narbonne (EUR280m, 20 years) in France as well as
contracts to supply alternative fuel to RWE and Cemex in the United Kingdom.
Those achievements confirm the Group progress in energy and material waste
recovery which is a strategic priority in the waste business.
* The Waste Europe division posted steady EBITDA of EUR374 million, versus
EUR377 million in H1 2013; organic growth showed limited decrease by -1.1% due
to the pressure on prices partially compensated by the increasing contribution
of the energy and material recovery activities. With an EBITDA margin on
revenue
of 11.9%, versus 11.7% the same period the previous year, the division shows

strong control of its cost base in still-lacklustre economic conditions in

over the six-month period.

Revenue
EBITDA
- The International division at 30 June 2014 posted revenue of EUR1,545
million, down -1.2% in organic terms.
* The Asia-Pacific Region continued to expand with revenues up +5.0%

(+EUR26m) in organic terms, thanks to satisfying activity both in China
and in Australia.
* The organic growth of the Africa, Middle-East, India region was +8.9%
(+EUR27m) mainly reflecting the water and waste activities in Morocco.
* The North America region grew by +2.0% (+EUR5m) in organic terms, with
price increases offsetting declining volumes due to high rainfall in the
spring.
change reflects the nonrecurring EUR30 million contribution in 2013 of the
commercial renegotiation of the Sydney drinking water distribution
contract, and the termination of some contracts including Mapocho in Chile
and others in the Middle East. However, the Design & Build backlog has
stabilized from the previous year at EUR0.9 billion.

* Degrémont revenue was down organically by EUR78 million (-13.5%). This

- Internationally, SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT continued its development with
innovative
and diversified offers throughout its entire value chain. For example, the
Group
was selected to build and operate a hazardous waste recycling plant at
Nantong,
China (EUR575m, 30 years). In the Middle East, Degrémont won the desalination
contract of Mirfa (EUR100m). In Morocco, the Group was selected to build and
operate the Meknès waste elimination and waste recovery plant (EUR90m, 20
years). In Canada, the Group won the contract to operate two waste recovery
plants near Edmonton (EUR54m, 5 years). The Group has also won a first
training
and knowledge-transfer contract in Baku, Azerbaijan (EUR23m, 5 years).
- The EBITDA of EUR389 million, which includes the gain on CEM disposal for
EUR129 million, is slightly down in organic terms (-0.9%), but restated for
the
EUR30 million organic contribution in Q2 2013 of the Sydney contract effect,
EBITDA organic growth would be +10.5%; as far as EBITDA margin is concerned,
it
would be 16.8% versus 15.7% last year. The International division generated
EUR14 million in Compass savings over the six months.
GOVERNANCE
In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Jean-Louis Chaussade terminated his
suspended employment contract with GDF SUEZ Management Company and advised the
Board of Directors of his decision to exercise his retirement rights related
to
pension schemes. After acknowledging this decision, the Board of Directors
decided to entrust him with a new term as Chief Executive Officer, which will
continue until the end of his director's mandate, i.e. until the 2016 General
Meeting of Shareholders called to approve the financial statements for 2015.
