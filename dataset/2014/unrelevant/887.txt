By Maggie Lu Yueyang and Fayen Wong
SYDNEY/SHANGHAI, March 24 (Reuters) - China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd has ditched a plan
to buy out the minority shareholders of its Australian arm, sending shares of the Sydney-listed unit
diving and boding ill for an industry that has been trying to get back on its feet.

Last July, state-backed Yanzhou offered to buy the 22 percent it does not own in Yancoal Australia Ltd
for A$0.91 a share, valuing the unit at A$905 million ($823 million).

A few months later, the bid cleared foreign investment regulatory hurdles, reflecting the Australian
government's desire to protect assets and jobs in an industry that has been whipped by weakening
coal prices.
Yanzhou's decision to drop the offer comes after the company reported last week that its 2013 net
profit tumbled nearly 80 percent from a year earlier, weighed down by falling coal prices and a
depreciation in the Australian dollar.

Yanzhou, which owns 78 percent of Yancoal Australia, was also under pressure from Singapore
commodity trader Noble Group Ltd to improve the offer, Reuters previously reported.
Hong Kong-based Noble owns more than half of the minority shares and could block the deal from
going ahead, Reuters reported in October.

"We will do it when conditions are ripe. Under the current market conditions, a privatisation does not
work well for minority shareholders," Wu Yuxiang, director and chief financial officer of Yanzhou told
reporters at the firm's results briefing.

Analysts said rising production costs and poor profits had also weakened Yanzhou's balance sheet,
with the firm's gross debt-to-equity gearing reaching 137 percent in 2013, up from 90 percent the
year before.
"Going forward, cost control remains ... the key task for Yanzhou Coal to stay above break-even amid
a weak coal price outlook," said Shanghai-based Helen Lau, a senior mining analyst at UOB-Kay
Hian.

Yanzhou Chairman Li Xiyong said Yanzhou was focused on slashing costs in 2014, after having
already cut 5,400 contractors last year that resulted in cost savings of 600 million yuan ($96.39
million). Yanzhou plans to cut another 3,000-5,000 contractors this year.

imports remaining a threat, Li said.
Local steam coal prices fell 16 percent last year on the back of an economic slowdown and change in
the national energy strategy to cut coal consumption. After a brief rebound late last year, prices have
been on a steady decline since January to hover around 553 yuan a tonne.

Yancoal shares, which dropped 24 percent last year, ended down 9.4 percent at A$0.55. The stock fell
as much as 14.1 percent following the announcement. The benchmark Australian share index closed
up 0.2 percent.

Yanzhou's shares climbed 2.8 percent in Shanghai, versus a 0.9 percent gain on the Shanghai
Composite Index.
