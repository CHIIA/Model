A weaker global growth outlook, another fall in the iron ore price and soft local employment figures
helped push the Australian sharemarket lower on Thursday.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the All Ordinaries Index fell 0.5 per cent on Thursday to
5428.8 points and 5407.9 points respectively.

Local shares followed equity markets in the United States and Europe lower as investors digested
a move by the World Bank to lower its global growth forecast for 2014 from 3.2 per cent to 2.8 per
cent. Major markets around Asia traded lower in the afternoon.

In domestic economic news, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed the unemployment rate in
May was 5.8 per cent in line with forecasts. But economists said the labour market is softer than the
unemployment rate suggests and that it hides a falling participation rate as more job seekers give up
looking for work.
"Employment tends to be a lagging indicator so it does not have a big influence on our equity
strategy," Zurich Financial Services senior investment strategist Patrick Noble said.
Mining was the worst-performing sector, down 0.9 per cent, as the spot price for iron ore, landed in
China, edged down another 0.1 per cent to $US93.50 a tonne. A steep fall in iron ore futures trading
in China suggested the spot price would fall again on Thursday night.

Resources giant BHP Billiton shed 0.6 per cent to $35.71, main rival Rio Tinto fell 1.1 per cent to
$58.72 and iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group lost 4.6 per cent to $4.33. "BHP moved this week
to cut more costs in response to softer commodity prices so smaller miners with higher costs must be
really feeling the pinch. Expect to see more profit forecast downgrades from the junior mining and
mining services sector," Mr Noble said.
Junior iron ore miner Arrium was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200, down 7.3 per cent at
83¢. BC Iron and Mount Gibson Iron also lost more than 5 per cent each.

"As investors grow more cautious on the global growth outlook, money is finding its way back in to
high yield stocks," Mr Noble said. But the big defensive names were caught in Thursday's
sell-off.Banks take a dive

Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 0.4 per cent to $81.88, while Westpac Banking Corporation shed
0.5 per cent to $34.58. ANZ Banking Group lost 0.2 per cent to $33.83, and National Australia Bank
dipped 0.9 per cent to $33.33.

Telstra Corporation lost 0.8 per cent at $5.21, Woolworths shed 0.2 per cent to $36.60, and
Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, fell 0.5 per cent to $41.61.

government said it would consult on cross-media ownership laws. Southern Cross Media gained
4.9 per cent to $1.08.

Healthcare was the only major sector to edge higher, up 0.1 per cent. Private hospital operator
Ramsay Health Care rose 3.7 per cent to $46.80 as Credit Suisse upgraded it to "buy" a day after
Ramsay sealed a €429 million ($618.5 million) French acquisition.

Engineering group Leighton Holdings lifted 1.7 per cent to $20.15 on the news it plans to sell its
$1 billion John Holland division. Property firm Goodman Group fell 0.8 per cent to $5.15, despite
lifting its annual earnings outlook.
