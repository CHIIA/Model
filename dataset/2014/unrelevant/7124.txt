Energy Australia was originally founded in 1995, and has since matured into a leader within its space. Its
$5 billion portfolio includes power plants, gas plants, mines and wind farms spread across Victoria, New
South Wales, and South Australia.
The company invests a substantial amount of recourses in sustainability through its dynamic Climate

installations.

Billing Platform's powerful billing engine will be responsible for processing billing transactions related to
Energy Australia's business and residential services supporting Orders, Sales, Installations, and
Maintenance. This new system also integrates with Salesforce.com to provide end-to-end, streamlined
quote-to-cash-to-support processes, helping EA meet customer demands in the most efficient way
possible.

Billing Platform CTO, Leo Solomon Comments:
"Along with core billing and rating functionality, the platform centralizes inventory management, purchase
orders, and invoice & statement generation and delivery in an efficient, automated set of processes. The
Platform's unique customization capabilities provide EA with the ability to implement the exact business
scenarios they need quickly and efficiently making their new billing and support system highly adaptable
to change."

Billing Platform is proud to be part of an initiative that will help contribute to a sustainable future, and
