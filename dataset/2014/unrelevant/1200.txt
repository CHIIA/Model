SYDNEY-- Mineral Resources Ltd. said it bought a 12.8% stake in takeover target Aquila Resources
Ltd. to gain a foothold in a 7.4 billion Australian dollar (US$6.9 billion) iron-ore project, cooling
speculation of a rival bid for the mining company.
Aquila last month received a takeover bid led by China's Boasteel Group valuing it at A$1.4 billion.

Mineral Resources said Thursday that taking a strategic stake will give it a chance to participate in the
development of Aquila's West Pilbara iron-ore project in Western Australia state. The company said it
had already drawn up a development plan where it would take responsibility for all processing and
mine-related infrastructure, as well as the supply chain through to shiploading.

"We have the financial capacity to make a meaningful capital contribution toward the development of
the project," Chris Ellison, chief executive of Mineral Resources, said in a statement.

Mr. Eillson said Mineral Resources was prepared to work with Aquila and Baosteel to bring the mine
into production.
Baosteel, which owns China's largest listed steel mill, bought 15% of Aquila in 2009 when iron-ore
prices were rising, and later raised its stake to 20%. It was attracted to Aquila's plans for the West
Pilbara project, which is expected eventually to produce more than 30 million metric tons of iron ore a
year.

Baosteel first announced its plan to work with rail-freight hauler Aurizon Holdings Ltd. on a joint
takeover offer for Aquila last month. Under the proposal, Baosteel would own as much as 85% of
Aquila, which also owns an undeveloped coking-coal prospect in Queensland state. Aurizon would take
the remaining interest.
Aquila, whose executive chairman and co-founder Tony Poli holds 29% of the company, hasn't so far
responded to Baosteel's proposal.
