Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open relatively
flat with the local futures contract up 1 point.

"In terms of the bigger picture, I remain steadfast in my view that it is late in the ball game for investors.

"Index leadership is bearish both here and in the US. Sector leadership is largely bearish as well. And
you are now seeing Extreme Greed in the US as per CNN Moneys Fear and Greed index.

"Now I still have one more rally high pencilled in for our market in the short to medium term, I am just not
sure of the exact timing or level at present.

"But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5500. The floor will be 5431. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5462, down 7.7 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 5.7 points to 5469.7 last evening.

*SBM: Gold Ridge personnel return to site/agrees works with Govt
St Barbara Ltd announced Gold Ridge Mining Ltd and the Solomon Islands Government have agreed for
Gold Ridge personnel to return to the Solomon Islands following the lifting of a government immigration
ban to enable a site assessment and a range of agreed site works to be undertaken. Senior executives
from the company recently participated in a cultural reconciliation process with the Solomon Islands
Prime Minister.
The government has established an Interim Working Group to work directly with Gold Ridge Mining to
expedite government approvals and reporting processes.
A preliminary review of the Gold Ridge site indicates that the key assets and infrastructure have been
well secured by the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. However a large number of illegal miners have
returned to the mining areas.
The company plans to conduct an agreed range of site works with a particular focus on lowering water
levels in the tailings dam which had risen significantly during torrential rainfall in early April.
The company will also continue to reduce holding costs and assess strategic options for the Gold Ridge
operation. (Jun 10)
