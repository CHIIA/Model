Funding and support package with Government finalised
Further to the announcement on 30 April 2014, Nyrstar NV ('Nyrstar' or the 'Company') announced today
it has signed a binding agreement for the final funding and support package for the redevelopment of the
Port Pirie smelter into an advanced metals recovery and refining facility (the 'Redevelopment') with the
South Australian Government and EFIC[1], the export credit agency of the Australian Federal
Government.

Highlights

* Pivotal milestone in the redevelopment of Nyrstar Port Pirie and of the wider Metals Processing
segment transformation.  No further approvals needed

* Fundamental step in achieving our stated mission to maximise value from our integrated business
model

* Conversion of Nyrstar Port Pirie smelter into an advanced metal recovery and refining facility enabling
fundamentally different business model for the asset
* Significant investment with capital cost of ca. EUR 338 million (ca. AUD 514 million) supported by an
innovative funding package
* Nyrstar's direct contribution as expected ca. EUR 68 million (ca. AUD 103 million)

* Final Feasibility Study confirms compelling business case with expected post tax leveraged IRR of
25-30%[2]  

* Work on site remains on schedule, all major development and supporting legislation obtained - on track
for completion at the end of 2016
* FY2014e Group top-end CAPEX maintained at EUR 335 million;  FY 2014e Redevelopment CAPEX of
EUR 95-105 million

Roland Junck Chief Executive Officer of Nyrstar said: "I am pleased to announce that we have reached
this pivotal milestone in the Redevelopment. The funding agreement gives us the certainty we need to
move forward and transform Nyrstar Port Pirie into an advanced metal recovery and refining facility that
will benefit all our employees, the Port Pirie community and our investors. We remain on track with work
on site for this year, construction work to begin early next year, and the facility to be fully operational by
the end of 2016. 

This is a major project and a significant undertaking by Nyrstar. Following our in principle funding
agreement in December 2012, we have delivered today on the innovative funding package with
significant support from the South Australian Government and the Australian Federal Government.
Importantly, the final agreement ensures that our direct contribution remains unchanged thereby limiting
the impact on our financial capacity and our ability to deliver on the wider Company strategy. The

Investment case

Following the completion of the Final Feasibility Study ('FFS') in Q1 2014, the estimated total capital cost
of the Redevelopment is ca. EUR 338 million (ca. AUD 514 million). The increase in the capital cost
from the estimate of ca. EUR 231 million (ca. AUD 351 million) at prefeasibility stage principally reflects
Nyrstar taking on the construction of a new and increased capacity sulphuric acid plant. During the
feasibility process, Nyrstar explored the potential for a third party to build, own and operate the acid plant,
however, it was concluded it would be more beneficial for Nyrstar not to do so in order to retain full
operational control and subsequent marketing benefits. In addition the ca. EUR 338 million estimate
reflects expected inflationary impacts over the spending horizon for the project; analysis was not
advanced enough at the prefeasibility stage to identify the amount of this inflationary impact.

Nyrstar has conducted a stringent review process to finalise the final investment case for the
Redevelopment, including further detailed engineering studies. Along with a designated Nyrstar team,
specialist consultants were commissioned to perform engineering, estimating, scheduling, and various
reviews on the FFS including a number of independent peer reviews.

Whilst the estimated total capital cost of the Redevelopment has increased, the underlying investment
case remains robust driven by a substantial increase in all free metals once the facility is fully operational
in 2016, and the benefits of restructuring the zinc production currently conducted at the site (see below
'Zinc production at Port Pirie).

Nyrstar continues to expect the Redevelopment to generate a post-tax leveraged IRR of 25-30%, using
internal economic and flat metal price assumptions for the duration of the project. 
Upon completion, the Company estimates ca. 50% increase in throughput that will allow for the rest of
the Port Pirie site to be used at full capacity.  Increased furnace flexibility will allow Nyrstar Port Pirie to
significantly improve the added value from production at the site by processing a wider range of high
value and high margin concentrates and residues from Nyrstar's existing smelters. Concentrates from the
Company's own mines and residues from Nyrstar's zinc smelting network are expected to account for
approximately 50% of feed material requirements.  As the contribution from free metal and by-products
increases, and the dependence on treatment charges reduces, gross profit is expected to materially
increase.

Nyrstar expects operating costs per tonne of market metal at Nyrstar Port Pirie to decline by ca. 20%[3] in
local currency terms once the project is fully operational, which will in turn drive improved EBITDA and
Free Cash Flow.

Nyrstar Port Pirie is expected to have the capacity to produce a range of metals yearly including ca.
250,000 tonnes of refined lead, ca. 40,000 tonnes of zinc in fume, ca. 7,000 tonnes of copper in matte,
and ca. 25.0 million troy ounces of silver dore, containing ca. 100,000 troy ounces of gold.

In light of with the revised scope of the project, Nyrstar expects redevelopment capital expenditure for
2014 to be between EUR 95-105 million. The increase will be offset by savings within other parts of the
Group resulting in overall guidance for the year of EUR 290-335 million.  Capital expenditure for the
Redevelopment is expected to be higher in 2015 when the majority of the construction works begin. Full
guidance for 2015 will be provided at the time of the FY 2014 Results in February 2015. 

The Redevelopment will reduce the environmental footprint of the existing smelter, providing a step
change reduction in airborne metal and dust emissions.

Funding and support package

The package comprises of three parts. Firstly, the revised funding arrangements have been renegotiated
with the South Australian Government and EFIC , and Nyrstar's direct contribution remains unchanged at
ca. EUR 68 million (ca. AUD 103 million).
* Direct contribution from Nyrstar: ca. EUR 68 million (ca. AUD 103[4] million)
As at 30 April 2014, ca. EUR 19 million (ca. AUD 29 million) has been spent on feasibility studies, with
the remainder of the contribution expected by the end of 2014.

* Project level financing: structured investment to third party financiers benefiting from a AAA credit rated
guarantee from EFIC, supported by a back-to-back guarantee from the South Australian Government: ca.
EUR 191 million (ca. AUD 291[5] million)

Page15of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Nyrstar Port Pirie will issue perpetual securities to a special purpose vehicle ('SPV'), created solely for the
financing of the Redevelopment. The SPV will raise funds from third party financiers benefiting from a
guarantee from EFIC supported by a back-to-back guarantee from the South Australian Government.
Nyrstar expects to utilise the funding from early 2015. Forecast distributions are expected to reduce the
amount of perpetual securities outstanding between 2017 and 2021. The perpetual securities receive
IFRS equity accounting treatment, as there is no obligation on Nyrstar Port Pirie to amortise the
perpetual securities; however, Nyrstar does not expect any perpetual securities to be on issue by the end
of 2021. The funding that is raised by the SPV will be guaranteed by EFIC and has a AAA credit rating.

And the third part of the funding package:
* Forward sale of future silver production: ca. EUR 79 million (ca. AUD 120 million)
Nyrstar intends to enter into a transaction for the forward sale of silver output from the redeveloped
Nyrstar Port Pirie facility for an upfront payment of ca. AUD 120 million ('Prepayment Agreement'). The
Prepayment Agreement is expected to be entered into during 2014 for a term of five years. Under the
terms of the agreement, silver will be delivered under a defined delivery schedule post commissioning
from 2016 until the end of 2019.

In 2013 Nyrstar received major development approval from the South Australian Government, allowing it
to proceed with construction of the project; and the Company remains on track with its work on site for
the remainder of 2014.  This includes mobilising the project's construction management team to site, as
well as foundation piling and concrete works for the oxygen enriched bath smelting furnace, acid plant
and oxygen plant. In addition, the South Australian parliament passed legislation in 2013 giving Nyrstar
regulatory certainty in relation to the Redevelopment. The legislation has been proclaimed and is now
operational.

Nyrstar expects to begin ramp up of the facility during H1 2016 and operate at full capacity by the end of
that year.

Zinc production at Port Pirie

In parallel with the FFS, Nyrstar critically reviewed opportunities to immediately strengthen the financial
viability of the Port Pirie site.  The review identified that since 2009, the zinc plant at the site has
experienced deteriorating production volumes and rising costs, ultimately making the plant unsustainable.
The plant is the highest cost zinc plant in Nyrstar's smelter portfolio. 

Nyrstar will cease zinc metal production at Port Pirie by the end of July this year, and will process zinc
oxide at Nyrstar's other smelter assets. The zinc plant is expected to close by the end of 2015 and
Nyrstar will engage and consult with employees and their representatives with a focus on available
retraining and redeployment opportunities to other parts of the Port Pirie operation. This decision will
have no impact on the overall Redevelopment.  The Company will look to reuse certain zinc plant assets
in other production areas onsite, and across Nyrstar's smelting business.
