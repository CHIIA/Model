SHARE PRICE MOVEMENTS

---------------------

Shares of GPS Alliance Holdings yesterday advanced 5c to 21c 16c. Rolling high for the year is 21c and
low 7c.
The company has 23.3 million shares on issue with a market cap of $4.9 million

Chairman Ian Thiam Hee told shareholders last year that history was created with its successful listing on
the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:GPS) raising gross proceeds from the issue of new shares of
S$3.8 million.

"We were pleased with the keen interest from investors and we would like to thank you for your
confidence in the Group.

"On August 17, 2013, we acquired a 60% effective interest in Probuild Pte. Ltd., Ecobuild Products Pte.
Ltd., Novel Praxis Pte. Ltd. and Probuild Sdn Bhd (collectively, the "Probuild Group").
The Probuild Group is involved in the trading of building materials, interior design and fit-out work
businesses and this acquisition is expected to create synergistic opportunities as the Company grows its
interior design and fit-out work business.

In February 2014, we announced that we have been awarded a four-year project management service
contract for China Chongqing Yongchuan District Xianghai Hot Spring Development, worth approximately
S$4.4 million.

city and 80 kilometres from the Jiangbei International Airport.
The development will consist of a land area of 333,000 square metres, a 5-star hotel and villas, theme
parks, residential and commercial areas.
The Group's revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 ("FY2013") increased by 5.3% from
S$25.1 million in financial year ended December 31, 2012 ("FY2012") to S$26.5 millionin FY2013.
This was mainly due to contribution from newly acquired Probuild Group.
Revenue of S$3.1 million was contributed by the Probuild Group after they were acquired by the Group
in August 2013.
This was partially offset by lower revenue of S$2.2 million from the Real Estate Agency, of which revenue
from primary and secondary markets were adversely affected as cooling measures and mortgage curbs
implemented by both local and certain regional countries' Governments dampened both the local and
regional property markets.
The Group's gross profit decreased from S$4.2 million in FY2012 to S$3.0 million in FY2013 mainly due
to gross loss from the Probuild Group arising from low utilisation of resources during this initial setup
period to increase production capacity (both manpower and infrastructure, including setup of three
Malaysian factories) to cope with the increased order book.

Administrative expenses increased from S$3.4 million in FY2012 to S$6.0 million in FY2013 mainly due to
additional costs incurred which were incidental to the Group's public listing and office relocation costs.

Distribution costs increased from S$0.3 million in FY2012 to S$0.6 million in FY2013 due to increased
spending on advertisement and marketing to strengthen brand awareness of the real estate agency as
well as the various structured business units.
The Group's performance were adversely impacted by oneoff items in FY2013 namely
i. offer expenses of S$0.6 million incurred in relation to the Group's public listing on the ASX on 2 July
2013;

ii. employee share based expenses relating to the issuance of 7,446,460 ordinary shares at S$1.9 million
to two founding directors on 30 April 2013 in recognition of their services to the Group; and

iii. interest amounting to S$1.6 million for the loan from Koon Holdings Limited ("Koon"), which was
applied towards the Watercolours Executive Condominium project. Due to current accounting
requirements, we have booked interest cost on the amount outstanding whilst profits from the
Watercolours Executive Condominium project cannot be recognised until when the project achieved
Temporary Occupation Permit ("TOP") which is expected in late 2014.

The loan has been fully repaid in December 2013.
The Group recorded a loss of S$6.8 million in FY2013 as compared to a profit of S$1.2 million in FY2012
mainly due to the factors above.

Moving forward, we hope to continue growing our business organically and through joint ventures or
strategic alliances, the chairman concluded.
