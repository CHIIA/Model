0138 - Women's athletic-wear maker Lorna Jane is attracting a flurry of suitors as companies try to
bolster exposure to a hot part of the retail sector. Foot Locker (FL) and private-equity firms Advent and
Bain are among the companies which have placed first-round bids for the yoga and exercise-gear maker.
Mainstream retailers have been trying to boost their athletic offerings, especially following the success of
Lululemon (LULU). Gap (GPS) competes with its Athleta brand while VF Corp. (VFC) has Lucy.

0818 - A move lower in AUD/NZD signals further weakness in the pair in the days ahead, says Westpac.
"It's back in the old 1.0550-1.0900 range, with a slight negative medium-term bias. At some point the
market will start pricing in RBA tightening and a significant rally will ensue, but that's a story for late this
year." The pair is at 1.0651. Westpac says that its a lightweight day for data with NZ food prices and
housing data and Australian home loans data minor for the markets. It adds that pair may head toward
1.0540 over the next couple of days. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

0825 - JPMorgan keeps its Overweight rating on Transurban (TCL.AU), saying it's still a solid defensive
stock, after 4Q traffic and revenue data. The broker expects an 11.5% rise in FY 2014 group
proportionate earnings before interest and tax, after net corporate expenses, and a 7.4% increase in FY
2014 earnings per share to 31.2 cents. Target price creeps up to A$8.29. FY14 results are due August 5.
TCL last A$7.58. (david.rogers@wsj.com; @DavidRogersWSJ)
0903 - Credit Suisse slashes Energy Resources (ERA.AU) to Underperform from Outperform after
disappointing results from its Ranger Deeps exploration program. It says mining will be more expensive
than previously assumed, after ERA said some geotechnical conditions have been encountered that are
less favorable than assumed in the Order of Magnitude study. "We doubt this revised resource will be
large enough to have the Commonwealth Parliament extend the tenure of the Ranger Project Area past
the Jan '21 end date," the broker says. "And with the collapse of the uranium price, higher mining costs,
and only a five-year mine life, we consider a Deeps mine would struggle to create any value." Target falls
67% to A$0.50. (david.rogers@wsj.com)

0914 - An improvement in Australia's housing construction market is boosting profits at building materials
company CSR, but its shares have run a little too hard, says Bell Potter, which cuts its recommendation
on the stock to hold from buy. CSR is trading at a modest 6% premium to its peer group, reflecting a
potential 50% jump in its FY15 earnings, the broker says. It's bumped up its price target to A$3.79 from
A$3.70, given the brighter outlook for its aluminum business as prices for the commodity rise. CSR was
last at A$3.66. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

0925 - Credit Suisse lifts Crown Resorts (CWN.AU) to Neutral from Underperform after the share price
approached its target. The broker's Asian gaming team anticipates Melco Crown Entertainment will
recover as the World Cup no longer diverts gaming budgets and junket lending rebuilds after a murky
bad debt situation. "However, we lowered our Crown EPS forecast by 4%-9% to reflect the relatively
weak 2Q likely experienced by MPEL," Credit Suisse analysts Larry Gandler and Ben Levin say. Target
price rises to A$16.30 from A$15.00. Last A$15.43. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

0931 - It's time for investors to rebalance portfolios away from Australian yield stocks, with many retail
investors holding 80% of the funds in banks and Telstra (TLS.AU), marketmatters.com.au principal

Page213of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Shawn Hickman says. He expects high-yield equities to fall sharply as U.S. interest rates rise, and warns
that Aussie bank shares could suffer Friday after Portugal's largest listed bank plunged 18% after
delaying some debt payments. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0946 - Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is expected to suffer from European debt concerns, with overnight SPI
200 futures down 0.4% after Banco Espirito Santo deferred a debt repayment, pushing its stock down
18% before trading in its shares and bonds was halted. While the S&P 500 pared a 1% fall after
Portugal's central bank said Banco Espirito Santo is protected, a potential default by Portugal's biggest
bank could rekindle wider concern about European debt. "Is this an isolated event or is it the first chink
in the chain to fire contagion fears?" IG strategist Evan Lucas says. "These issues have always been
simmering and the data has suggested that normal setting in these economies is still a long way off. The
fiscal support across the region would suggest support will come quickly, but that is unlikely to quell the
rush for the exit." Index last 5464.4. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)
0957 - Sustained weakness in coal prices and a relatively high Aussie dollar has J.P. Morgan
questioning whether Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC.AU) will be able to get its Maules Creek project over
the line without having to find extra cash. "To-date, management has been comfortable that the A$1.2
billion in debt facilities is sufficient to pay for Maules Creek," says analyst Mark Busuttil. "However, with
coal prices remaining weak and the Australian dollar still strong, there is a risk--albeit not our base
case--that additional funding will be required." J.P. Morgan cut its price target to A$2.00 from A$2.25, but
keeps an overweight rating on the stock. Whitehaven closed unchanged Thursday at A$1.445 a share.

1028 - Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is down 0.4% at 5444.1, matching an overnight fall in the S&P 500, after
Banco Espirito Santo deferred a debt repayment, pushing its stock down 18%. Banks and iron ore
miners are weighing on the market, with the 4-major banks down 0.4%-0.5% and Rio Tinto (RIO.AU),
Fortescue (FMG.AU) and Atlas Iron (AGO.AU) down 1.0%-4.8%. Focus now turns to domestic housing
finance data at 0130 GMT. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)
1033 - Scentre Group (SCG.AU), the company that has all the Australian and New Zealand shopping
malls once owned by Westfield (WFD.AU), is a stand-out among domestically focused Australian REITs,
says Deutsche Bank, which initiates coverage with a buy recommendation and A$3.65 price target vs.
the A$3.20 latest trade. The market still isn't recognizing the value of Scentre's development and
property management platform, the broker says, while looming assets sales worth around A$1.2 billion
to reduce debt levels won't be the earnings killer some people expect, it adds. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

1041 - Australian May housing finance approvals data are due at 0130 GMT. The median estimate of 19
economists surveyed by the WSJ is for a 0.5% fall in the number of owner-occupied finance approvals,
and the range is -2% to +1%. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

1054 - AUD/USD resilience to news that Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo (BES) missed debt payment
hints at safe-haven characteristics, but it will suffer if volatility rises further in response to contagion
worries, according to NAB. "Markets are left torn between viewing this news as BES-specific or
something more systematic," says Ray Attrill, NAB's Global Co-Head of FX Strategy. He notes that the
most likely solution is a state-brokered rescue deal for BES, but cautions that volatility is unlikely to
subside quickly. Also, restraining the Aussie is rising expectations of another interest rate cut between
February and April 2015, after the domestic jobless rate hit a fresh 11 year high of 6.02% in June.
AUD/USD last at 0.9388. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

1131 - Mixed labor data has been keeping the Australian dollar under pressure recently, Credit Agricole
CIB says. But the bank doesn't expect the latest news to make the Reserve Bank of Australia turn more
dovish because it has already anticipated additional labor-market weakness. Credit Agricole says RBA
rate expectations are unlikely to change considerably and the currency will be driven more by
international risk sentiment. The bank expects that to stabilize again and, accordingly, "the AUD should
be bought on dips--for instance against the USD," the bank says. Spot AUD/USD was recently at 0.9383
compared with 0.9390 in late New York trade Thursday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
