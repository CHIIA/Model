Bob Ell founded property development company Leda Group in 1976. It focused on Sydney's industrial
property market before branching out into commercial and retail property developments. Success in
Sydney led to larger projects in Queensland and Canberra. The company owns and manages several
Queensland shopping centres, including Ipswich Riverlink, Morayfield and Victoria Point Shopping
Centre. It also has a 50 per cent share in Tuggeranong Hyperdome in the ACT. Ell's wealth increased this
year after the sale of some key properties. Chinese investor Bridgehill paid $80 million for an office tower
in Milsons Point and Singapore-based Far East Organisation bought the Clocktower Square in The
Rocks, for $72 million (Leda owned 50 per cent). Ell spent $30 million on a house in Bellevue Hill, which
was a new record for a non-waterfront property in this suburb .
