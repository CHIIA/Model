AQUILA Resources shares have surged 37 per cent after the iron ore miner received a $1.42 billion
takeover bid from Aurizon and Baosteel Resources
The deal would see the two companies acquire Aquila and its 50 per cent stake in the West Pilbara Iron
Ore Project.

Aurizon shares fell more than four per cent after it announced plans to split the project's operations into a
mining company and an infrastructure company.

At 1134 AEST Aquila shares were 90.5 cents, or 37 per cent higher, at $3.35 while Aurizon shares were
24 cents, or 4.6 per cent, lower at $4.93.
The proposal fits with Aurizon's plan to expand its interests in the Pilbara and would provide iron ore to
Baosteel's Chinese steel factories.

Aurizon, formerly QR National, and Baosteel are offering to pay $3.40 per Aquila share, which is 38 per
cent above Aquila's closing price of $2.45 on Friday.
Baosteel already owns a 19.8 per cent stake in Aquila.
