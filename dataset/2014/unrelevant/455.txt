THE sale of a large-scale operation such as the Van Diemen’s Land Company could be the “catalyst”
for other investment activity, according to VDL’s chief financial officer Joshua Taylor.
Mr Taylor told the Business Sweden “Excellence from farm to shelf” conference in Melbourne last
week that Australia’s largest dairy operation was still on the market but it had not been sold despite
strong interest. “We are seeing a lot of action from potential investors looking at us and other dairy
investments,” he said.

“A lot is coming out of China.” VDL operates 25 dairy farms in northwest Tasmania, expects to
produce 7 million kilograms of milks solids this season and supplies dairy giant Fonterra.
Mr Taylor said if one person “stumped up $100-$200 million” for VDL, that could prompt others to
invest. He said a local farm was recently sold to a Thai investor and to “watch this space” in terms of
dairy investment.
Mr Taylor said VDL had a renewed focus on milk quality, which had added $1 million to its bottom
line.
Seventy-eight per cent of VDL farms recently received an industry milk quality award that recognised
those with a low bulk milk cell count.That compared to the industry average of 43 per cent.
