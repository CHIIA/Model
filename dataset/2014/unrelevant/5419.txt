THE nation’s tightly held iron- ore fraternity has a brash new entrant after resources heiress Gina
Rinehart yesterday announced her arrival as a legitimate, stand-alone player.
In securing final funding of almost $8 billion for her Roy Hill project in Western Australia’s Pilbara
region, Mrs Rinehart, the daughter of iron-ore magnate Lang Hancock, has now all but realised her
ambition of running a mine in her own right.

Roy Hill’s future became assured after Mrs Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting signed a $US7.2 billion
($7.98 billion) funding package in Singapore on Thursday with an international consortium of 19
banks, including Australia’s big four.
The decade-long deal completes the debt equation for the $US10 billion project, of which almost a
third has been built.

Roy Hill chief executive Barry Fitzgerald said the financing was the biggest amount for a land-based
mining project worldwide, solidifying the importance of iron ore, a key steelmaking ingredient, to the
global growth picture.

Mrs Rinehart, who is also Roy Hill’s chairwoman, is eyeing first export in September 2015 and
predicting annual production of 55 million tonnes.
The project will be the first majority-owned by Hancock, which holds 70 per cent of the equity
alongside Japanese steelmaker Marubeni Corporation (15 per cent), South Korean steel giant POSCO
(12.5 per cent) and China Steel Corporation (2.5 per cent). Hancock is a joint partner with Rio Tinto at
the nearby Hope Downs mine.
Roy Hill will also cement Mrs Rinehart as the Pilbara’s fourth power behind mining titans BHP Billiton
and Rio Tinto as well as Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Metals.

IG Markets market strategist Evan Lucas said the new entrant was unlikely to pose a threat to the trio
in the short term. He said the impact of additional supply into China could affect pricing levels, but it
was at least three years away.
“It’s more likely to be an issue for Atlas Iron, BC Iron, those sorts of players,” he said.
And Hancock would need to “ride the iron ore price fluctuations” like any other miner.
The spot price of iron ore has stabilised at around $US110 after falling heavily from its
early-December peak of $US139 on weakening demand from ChinaRoy Hill mine is expected to have
a life of more than 20 years. It will employ up to 3600 people during construction and a 2000 once
operational.
