ENERGY: Horizon Oil says it is well positioned for continued growth after its full-year profit jumped on
the back of higher production and the partial sale of its interests in Papua New Guinea assets.
In the year to June 30, profit after tax jumped to $US12.83 million, compared with $US3.47m in the
previous year. Horizonsaid its $US23.8m asset sale to Osaka Gas and profits from its China
operations boosted the result. Revenue increased sharply to $US138.45m in the year, from
$US48.07m, due to increased oil production and higher realised prices The group declined to declare a
final dividend.Horizon Oil had planned to merge with Roc Oil during the reporting period, but Roc
instead recommended a $474m takeover offer from Chinese giant Fosun International.
