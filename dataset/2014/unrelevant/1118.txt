RESULTS: The local divisions of real estate agencies CBRE and JLL have turned in strong first-quarter
results, with each osingled out as high performers by their global parents.

CBRE’s Pacific business reported strong gross revenue growth, with the result 22 per cent ahead of last
year. CBRE president and chief executive, Australia & New Zealand, Tom Southern, cited the
performance of the group’s residential projects and residential valuations teams on the back of deep
demand.

The company undertook 63,012 residential valuations in the quarter — a 17 per cent lift on the
corresponding period last year — and sold more than 1000 units worth $775 million.

“We are seeing that first-home buyer activity is increasing (for apartments), as this buyer segment is
increasingly squeezed out of the traditional housing market,” Mr Southern said.JLL’s Australian unit had
a 20 per cent lift in revenues in the quarter over 2013 levels, with office and retail investment sales up
90 per cent on last year and office leasing 52 per cent ahead. JLL Australia chief executive Stephen
Conry said: “We have seen a very strong and productive start to the year for the markets.” He said the
overall investment market might find it difficult to beat the record high of $23 billion of sales last year, but
added new capital continued to pour in. “The bulk of Chinese activity has occurred in the residential
sector, both the acquisition of development sites and purchase of end product.”
