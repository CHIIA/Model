This brings aggregate deal value up 1% from the Q4 2013 total of $40.4 billion, achieved through closing
226 deals, and up 65% year-over-year from the Q1 2013 total of $23.5 billion across 260 deals. The
vigorous year-over-year growth this Q1 is moving closer to the average quarterly deal value of $43.4
billion recorded since 2007.

M&A markets for upstream oil and gas assets remained at a consistent and healthy level on trend with the
second half of 2013, after a very slow start earlier in 2013. Another positive signal during Q1 was that the
average deal size eclipsed $300 million, up 25% over Q4 2013 and up 80% year-over-year. Contributing
factors include stable to upward trending oil and gas prices, strong capital flows from the private equity
sector and continued activity among US resource players in the A&D markets to focus corporate activity
on stable, large and executable long-term drilling inventories. Critical to the success for these
mega-projects is the emphasis on execution and cost control." Examples of these contributing factors in

Q1 is the proposed $7.1 billion sale of Germany's RWE oil and gas subsidiary, RWE Dea, to an
opportunistic newly formed Russian company, LetterOne Group headed by Russian billionaireMikhail
Fridman. This transaction allows RWE to de-lever the balance sheet and focus on core businesses while
LetterOne strikes its first large deal to take advantage of an optimistic viewpoint on oil and gas pricing
going forward, particularly in Europe. While the timing of the LetterOne deal is not optimal given
deteriorating relations between Russia and the West over Ukraine's Crimea region, the fact that LetterOne
is not a state company should lessen any opposition to finalizing the deal. Private equity coffers remain
large and oil and gas presents a compelling investment in today's capital market environment. A case in
point in Q1 is private-equity firmTPG Capital, with $59 billion of capital under management, which
backed Maverick American Natural Gas' $1.8 billion purchase of a premier long-lived legacy natural gas
asset from Encana. The assets consist of 351 MMcfed (92% gas) and 1.5 Tcfe of proved reserves in
Wyoming's famous Jonah field. Maverick is a newly-established company managed by Dan Allen Hughes
Jr, Thomas Hart III and Craig Manaugh. TPG Capital initially committed up to $1 billion in November 2011
to target onshore North America conventional natural gas and remained patient for the right set of assets
and market conditions. For Encana, the transaction unlocks value to provide capital to pursue five
identified core focus areas. Global Activity by Region Regionally, North America's $23.2 billion in oil and
gas M&A activity (Table 2) continued to lead the global M&A market with a 56% share. Europe (18%) and
Australia (8%) follow as the globe's most active regions for deals. Rebounds this quarter occurred in
Europe and Canada. In Europe (including North Sea), based almost entirely on the strength of the $7.1
billion RWE/LetterOne transaction, deal activity rebounded to $7.3 billion from just $0.9 billion in Q4
2013, and compares historical quarterly average of $2.4 billion. Canada also rebounded to $8.4 billion,
more than double the $4.1 billion reported in Q4, and surpassed its average $7.6 billion in deals
announced quarterly since 2007. The largest Canadian deal was Canadian Natural Resources $2.8
billion (C$3.1) buy of Devon's western Canada conventional gas portfolio. The Australia region took 8%
of global deal value, or $3.3 billion, a 50% increase over its full year 2013 value of $1.9 billion, which
was a record low. This region has not accounted for over 5% of global deals since 2009. LNG projects are
driving the increased activity as Shell sold an interest in the Wheatstone LNG project to Kufpec for $1.1
billion and Pacific LNG sold an interest in the Elk/Antelope fields in Papua New Guinea to Oil Search for
$0.9 billion. South and Central America kept steady pace with 7% of global deals, an average the region
has consistently held since 2011. In contrast, African activity slowed to $1.1 billion in Q1 or 3% of the
market, after tapering off to $2.4 billion (6%) in Q4 but showing a historic high of 16% for the full year
2013.

According to Derrick Petroleum Services director Mangesh Hirve, "North America's market share jumped
to 57% from 46% quarter-to-quarter. While Asian companies continue to be active buyers, striking $4.8
billion of deals in Q1 or 12% of the market, the pace is down from Q4's $14.5 billion or 36% of the
market. The largest Asian deal this past quarter is Indian Oil Corporation partnering with China's Sinopec
to pay $2.3 billion for a 25% interest in Canadian Montney gas assets from Malaysian NOC Petronas
subsidiary Progress Energy. We certainly view this slower pace as a pause as Asia's share of the global
deals markets rose to 23% last year from 14% in 2011. Since 2007, Chinese and Asian NOCs have
bought $184 billion in assets, accounting for 15% of the overall market." "There were 12 deals which
topped $1 billion during Q1, tied with Q4 2013 but(... Press release has been abridged for publication)
