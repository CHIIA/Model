Singapore (Platts)--19Jun2014/341 am EDT/741 GMT
China National Offshore Oil Corp. is in talks to acquire up to 40% interest in the Aphrodite gas field in
Cyprus, potentially pitting itself against Australia's Woodside Petroleum, Israeli media reported Thursday.

Financial daily Globes, citing sources, said the Chinese company is eying between a 30% and 40%
stake in the field.
Houston-based Noble Energy owns 70% of the field, which is located in block 12 in Cyprus, while Delek
Group has the remaining 30% interest.

The report also said the field's 4.1 Tcf of estimated reserves could support a floating LNG plant, "which
would allow the Chinese company to export gas" to China.

Noble in May terminated a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Woodside for the latter to
take a 25% stake in Israel's giant Leviathan field for up to $2.7 billion, after failing to agree on
commercial terms.

Aphrodite is located north of Leviathan on the border between Cyprus and Israel.
Globes also reported over a week ago that Woodside remains in talks to take a stake in Cyprus' block
12, despite the failure of talks at Leviathan.

The newspaper said Woodside believes Aphrodite is suitable for development via FLNG, similar to the
one it was trying to promote for Leviathan.

The latest report said CNOOC stands a better chance of concluding the deal with Noble and Delek, but
did not specify any reasons.

"CNOOC was also interested in becoming a partner in the Leviathan field and sent representatives to
Israel several times for talks. But ultimately the Leviathan partners preferred Woodside and its greater
experience in FLNG projects," the report added.

Noble discovered the Aphrodite field in December 2011, and an appraisal well completed in October last
year showed a 5 Tcf gas resource of high quality methane. But the resource falls short of the volume
needed to proceed with a planned LNG export facility at Vassilikos, which for now is the heart of the
Cypriot government's energy policy.

This is not the first instance that CNOOC has been linked to the prospect. In early 2012, Cypriot Interior
Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis said the company was among several firms showing an interest in investing in
the field.
Officials at Cyprus' energy ministry could not be reached for comment Thursday.
