Takeovers: Hong Kong investment firm Stanhill Capital Partners plans to team up with Droxford
International, an investment vehicle controlled by Indonesia’s billionaire Salim family, to make a joint
bid for Robust Resources.

Stanhill and Droxford will offer 49c a share for the Robust stock they do not already own, a 56 per cent
increase on Stanhill’s solo offer of 31.5c a share made on July 18.

The pair own about 46.6 per cent of Sydney-based Robust, which has exploration projects in
Indonesia and the Philippines, including a gold, silver and base metals project at Romang Island.
The joint offer values the company at about $96 million. Robust shares rose 50 per cent to 44.5
cents.
Robust recently completed a reverse takeover of Mentum Inc, a listed company on London’s
Alternative Investment Market. Under the agreement, Robust sold gold and copper assets in the
Kyrgyz Republic to Mentum and took an 87.3 per cent stake in the company. Mentum changed its
name to Tengri Resources and will focus on Central Asia resource opportunities.Stanhill recently
rejected suggestions it could be acting with the Salim family in its bid.
