A Chinese investor has paid $13.2 million for an office building in the city-fringe suburb of North
Melbourne, an area poised for a new wave of development.
More than $130 million of property in North Melbourne and West Melbourne has changed hands since
November, when a Singaporean developer paid $41.5 million for a 10-storey office building at 383 King
Street.

The most recent deal involves an office property, owned and occupied by professional group
Engineers Australia. It is on a 2076- square-metre site at 13-21 Bedford Street, just off the intersection
of Peel and Elizabeth streets.

Six other tenants lease space at the 3000-square-metre office building but they are on short-term
leases, with the longest ending in 2017.

Savills Australia agent Nick Peden, who negotiated the deal with Clinton Baxter, said the buyer would
keep the building leased for a few years before undertaking a residential development.
The propertywas sold 32 per cent above its reserve, at a new record land rate for North Melbourne of
$6358 a square metre, Mr Peden said.

The top three prospective buyers out of the 11 expressions of interest received by Savills were all
based offshore and the campaign attracted 125 inquiries, he said.
Another deal, further north in the suburb, on a 1943-square-metre site at 287-313 Macaulay Road,
attracted 80 inquiries and sold for $4.8 million to a local developer with connections to Dubai. It was
sold by Knight Frank.

"There are no barriers to North Melbourne development, no need for a Docklands-style taskforce. The
infrastructure, the trams, the roads, favourable zoning and the strong community culture are already in
place," Mr Peden said.

"We are seeing a surge in developer and investor interest."

Other agents also report renewed interest in the area. CBRE agent Josh Rutman said multiple offers
were received for a 2271-square-metre parcel of land owned by veterinarian hospital Lort Smith at
15-27 Wreckyn Street.

He said local and offshore developers were equally keen on the area and prices were far in excess of
what was achieved 12 months ago.
