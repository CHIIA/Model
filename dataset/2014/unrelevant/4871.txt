0626 GMT [Dow Jones] China's economy can withstand a hard landing, but its impact could cross
borders, says Moody's. "The impact of even a 'hard' landing should not be overstated," the credit rating
agency said. It says even a pronounced property slowdown would reduce China's GDP by no more than
2 percentage points, and that is before accounting for any corrective measures from the government. It
says China's low debt-to-GDP ratio and strong external positions mean that "a flare-up in financial risk
would not lead to simultaneous banking sector instability and rapid exchange-rate depreciation". Some of
China's trade partners, especially commodity exporters like Australia and Indonesia, however, may be
vulnerable to a sharp Chinese slowdown. "These countries would not only suffer from an abrupt drop in
Chinese imports, but also falling commodity prices and lower investment," Moody's says.

0533 GMT [Dow Jones] A mining investment boom has ended in Australia, leading to less engineering
work, but residential and commercial building work is filling the void, says Craig James, chief economist
at CommSec. Elsewhere, a fall in public sector building as state governments repair their budgets is
being met by a rise in private sector building, he said. "It is no wonder that the Reserve Bank is on the
interest rate sidelines--it wants to see how it all plays out," James says. Still, the Reserve Bank can't be
complacent on inflationary pressures, he adds. While construction costs have eased in the engineering
sector with softer activity levels, inflation in the building sector has climbed to six-year highs, James says.

0519 GMT [Dow Jones] Myanmar's capital city Yangon will see the supply of new high-end apartments in
luxury condominium towers quadruple by 2017 says a report by Frontier Myanmar. Around 1,100 new
condominium units will have been completed in the second half of 2014 and annual supply in 2015 will be
limited at roughly 1,200 units. However in 2016 this number will rise sharply to more than 5,000 units,
with around the same number in 2017. The report also said that the launch prices of off-plan condo sales
have risen extremely quickly over the past five years, averaging between $250 and $300 per square foot
in the third quarter of this year. "But in our view, prices at the higher-end are now likely to stabilize due to
the large numbers of units launched and heightened completion amongst developers," said Clare
Hammond, Frontier's managing director. (celine.fernandez@wsj.com)

0512 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian residential investment declined by 2% over the third quarter, following
an 8.7% increase in first quarter and a 3.7% gain in the second quarter. Prashant Newnaha, an
economist at TD Securities, said the outcome is slightly disappointing in that the central bank "has looked
at this sector to pick up the slack" and drive growth in the economy. But he adds that residential work

Page199of244©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.done is up a strong 9.7% for the year and the value of private residential work remains near 25 year
highs. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter: @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0500 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's manufacturing output grew 0.2% on year in October but only
because of a boost from the highly volatile pharmaceuticals sector. Output reversed a 1.0% decline in
September but fell short of the median 2.1% growth predicted by a Dow Jones poll of five analysts. The
pharmaceutical segment grew 24.3% on year, reversing an 18.3% fall in September. The biomedical
sector, which includes production of other medical devices, rose 22.5% after a 10.4% contraction in
September. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output was down 4.3% in October, compared with a
0.9% rise in September. Singapore's pharmaceutical production is highly unpredictable as it's dominated
by a small number of multinational firms. Production of high-value medicines, for example a batch of
cancer drugs, can send production value soaring in a month, only to fall dramatically soon after as plants
undertake long periods of maintenance and closure between batches of different drugs.

0457 GMT [Dow Jones] The Philippines' release of third-quarter gross domestic product data Thursday
could trigger more volatility for the recently-stable peso. Upbeat trade data published Tuesday bodes well
for the GDP report. Analysts forecast the economy grew 6.5% on-year in the third quarter versus the
6.4% growth in the second quarter. The Philippines recorded a September trade surplus of $281 million
compared to a trade deficit of $663 million a year ago. If the GDP data spring a positive surprise, peso
strength could see USD/PHP break the October trendline at 44.91 which could give way to the Bollinger
downtrend channel at 44.85. Activation of the downtrend channel could encourage bearish USD/PHP
bets. USD/PHP is now 44.93 from its Tuesday close of 44.97. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0447 GMT [Dow Jones] Thailand's investment board approves its seven-year investment promotion
strategy with a focus to promote innovation and businesses that will help facilitate the military
government's "digital economy" platform, beginning next year. The Board of Investment said it will give
personal tax breaks to individuals that start projects the board deems crucial to the country's economic
restructuring and long-term competitiveness. The new regime will be applied to applications submitted
next year, onwards. The board will also promote investment in regional special economic zone by giving
investors three more years of tax breaks on personal income. (warangkana.chomchuen@wsj.com;

0433 GMT [Dow Jones] JP Morgan has lowered its June-2015 forecast for the Australian dollar to
US$0.8300 from US$0.8700 (now trading at US$0.8538) before returning to US$0.8600 by year end of
2015. It says the domestic macro-economic outlook and the expectation that the Reserve Bank of
Australia will begin to hike rates in fourth quarter of 2015 are the key supports for the view that the Aussie
dollar will bottom out in first half of next year before heading higher in the second half. It says the forecast
track for the Australian dollar remains very sensitive to disappointment on the economy and a rethink of
RBA policy. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter: @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0428 GMT [Dow Jones] a draft memorandum of understanding of Thailand-China cooperation to develop
medium-speed railway project will be up for deliberation by the country's parliament and may face
questions, says Maybank Kim Eng economist Tim Leelahaphan. The project, valued at 400 billion baht
($12.2 billion), focuses on the building of dual-track rail lines in three sections to link Bangkok to the
border of Laos. Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha says the two countries haven't talked about
funding the project yet and a working committee will be working out the details. "At the moment there's no

invest," he says. (warangkana.chomchuen@wsj.com; Twitter: @waanspeaking)

0417 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/INR is hardly changed Wednesday despite some early weakness in the
U.S. dollar. The daily Bollinger uptrend channel thus remains in effect--contingent on a daily close above
61.81--implying the dollar could keep rising in the near term. The overnight fall of the yield on U.S.
governmentbonds created a downdraft for the greenback in Asia, but most USD/Asia pairs have since
rebounded. The next trigger for USD/INR could be the release of more U.S. economic data later. U.S.
weekly jobless claims, spending on durable goods, and new home sales could be key numbers to watch.
Signs of weakness in the upcoming data might hamper expectations for an earlier-than-forecast U.S.
interest rate hike and thus weigh on the greenback. USD/INR is now 61.84 from its Tuesday close of
61.85. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0416 GMT [Dow Jones] India's telecommunications regulator sticks to its earlier proposals for the auction
of frequencies to cellphone companies. In a letter to Department of Telecommunications, the regulator
said it is not changing the starting prices, and asked the government to auction all available spectrum to
the cellphone firms to bring more clarity in the sector. The letter follows a note from the telecom
department seeking reconsideration of the regulator's earlier proposals. (krishna.jai@wsj.com; Twitter:

0405 GMT [Dow Jones] Companies the world over are adopting cloud technologies because they're
cheaper and offer flexible services, research firm Gartner says. In a recent survey, some 44% of
respondents at companies in the U.S., South America, Europe, Asia and Australia said the main benefit
of the cloud is that it offers "overall cost reduction." Other executives said they like the cloud because it
represents a "modern approach" and is more agile than traditional software and infrastructure systems,
according to Gartner. Still, there are some concerns about the technology, such as security and privacy,
especially regarding the potential for government snooping. (newley.purnell@wsj.com; Twitter:
