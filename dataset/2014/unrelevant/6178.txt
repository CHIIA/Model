Frasers Centrepoint, a Singapore-listed property company controlled by one of Thailand's richest men,
has made a A$2.6bn (US$2.4bn) approach for Australand, one of Australia's biggest property groups,
trumping a rival offer.

The move is the second big overseas venture by billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi since he won a
battle last year for control of Fraser & Neave, the Singapore drinks-to-property conglomerate.

Frasers yesterday said it had made a proposed $4.48-a-share cash offer for Australand, topping an
already sweetened bid of A$4.35 a share from Stockland, Australia's second-biggest listed property
group.
Frasers, which has a portfolio of residential and commercial property in Singapore, China and
Australia, was part of F&N until listed separately on the Singapore bourse in January.

Australand said it would allow Frasers exclusive access to its books for due diligence for four weeks.
"The board concluded that the conditional offer proposal [from Frasers] would deliver a compelling value
outcome for Austra-land securityholders and is superior to the final and conditional offer from
Stockland," said Paul Isherwood, Australand chairman. The Singapore group said the agreement would
be a "transformational transaction and catalyst for Fraser to deepen its roots . . . in Australia".

Australand shares rose 5.6 per cent to A$4.55 in Sydney yesterday while in Singapore, Frasers
Centrepoint fell 3.9 per cent to S$1.85.
