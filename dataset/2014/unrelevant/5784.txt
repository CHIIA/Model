Trading points:

Reporting today:

*AAD: Ardent Leisure reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $30.8 mln, div 6.6c/$34mln/$29.5 mln, div 6.9c/underlying $33.2 mln, full yr $59.3
mln.

*On February 5 a leading broker retained an "add" on Ardent Leisure with a price target of $$2.32 up from
$2 earlier. The broker said Main Event has a demonstrated track record of executing sale and leasebacks,
enabling efficient recycling of capital. The broker said while it was unlikely the company would sell the
underperforming Bowling portfolio and/or the stable but low growth Marinas business, which was possible,
deploying capital to the high growth Main Event business, this would be well received by the market.

*ALZ: Australand reports for the full year.

Analysts expectations: $147.5mln, div 11c.

*On January 23 a leading broker had a price target of $3.50 for Australand with an "underweight" rating.

*ANN: Ansell reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $US70.3 mln, div 20.3c/$US71.3 mln, div 17.4c.

*On February 13 a leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Ansell while reducing the price target to
$19.26 from $19.96. The broker said Ansell is trading below its $19.26 price target and encapsulates the
expected benefits from Barrier Safe. Increased leverage after BarrierSafe reduces scope for an increase
to forecast capital returns and/or another material acquisition.

*AZJ: Aurizon reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $245.1 mln, div 7c/$268.2 mln, div 7c/u/lying profit $258 mln up 16c, div 8c.
*On February 7 a leading broker said "very strong coal export volumes (up 15% on 1st half on pcp) will
contribute to growth in Aurizon and Asiano".

*On January 29 a leading broker had an "add" on Aurizon with a price target of $5.33, up from $5.27
earlier. The broker said it has increased its forecast EBITA across full year 2014/16 . The broker said an
upgrade to AZJ's coal haulage guidance seems likely after Aurizon reported 109.7Mt for first half 2014.
The broker said "we continue to be positive on the long term outlook for Aurizon - a potential doubling of
dividends over five years. "If the share price weakens (say on concerns of industrial unrest) use it as an
opportunity to buy stock".

*On January 28 a leading broker had a "hold" on Aurizon with a price target of $4.86 up from $4.66 earlier.
The broker said Aurizon will update its full year 2014 coal volume guidance at the first half result and
expects Aurizon to guide closer to 210/215 million tonnes than the current guidance of 200/205 million
tonnes. We believe there is upside risk to our forecasts" the broker said in the report.

*BEN: Bendigo & Adelaide Bank reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $185.7 mln, div 30c/$181.6 mln, div 31c/$190.5 mln div 33c/consensus $187 mln
div 31c.

*On February 10 Nomura said Bendigo is well positioned to deliver a solid result in 1st half 2014. While
market share trends were not particularly favorable for the regionals, we expect BEN' margin performance

Page128of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.to positively surprise the market. Given BEN's large reliance on retail funding (particularly TDs) it should
be well placed to deliver improving margins in first half 2014 and potentially in 2nd half 2014. Also, given
strength in the housing market BEN's headline performance should also benefit from solid contribution
from Homesafe.

*DWS: DWS reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $6.3 mln, div 3.c.

*FWD: Fleetwood reports for the half year.

*GOZ: Growth Properties reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $40.7 mln, div 9.4c.

*IMD: Imdex reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: 2c div.

*UGL: UGL reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $48.4 mln, div 17c/$46.8 mln, div 12c/$46 mln reported, underlying $61 mln, 19c
div.

*On January 29 a leading broker had an "underweight" on UGL with a price target of $5.73, up from $5.60
previously. The broker said UGL was the 4th in its preferences. WOR was the top choice followed by
Downer and TSE. Monadelphous was 5th and Leighton 6th.

The broker said in the medium term the outlook for UGL could improve with the business currently
shortlisted on a number of large infrastructure projects and the market for property services appearing
robust. In full year 2014 however we still see earnings risk as skewed to the downside as UGL's rail
division comes under pressure and cash flows and balance sheet metrics potentially disappoint.

*Another leading broker on January 17 had UGL as its No. 3 preference after Leighton and Worley. The
broker had a "hold" on UGL with a target price of $7.84. The broker said, "The stock is trading close to
trough levels, however we remain cautious given we expect guidance to be downgraded". The broker
didn't expect any change to the proposed demerger

*WSA: Western Areas reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $6 mln for the full year.

*On February 10 following WSA's full year 2014 guidance a leading broker retained an "overweight" on
WSA saying overall the update brings WSA's targets closer to its estimates, which were higher than
WSA's original guidance, but it still sees some conservatism in the new guidance.

Based on unaudited results, WSA said it expects to report improvements from the prior six month period
for EBITDA margins, EBITDA and NPAT.

*On January 28 a leading broker lifted its rating for WSA to "buy" from "neutral" with a price target of
$3.20, up from $3.18, on valuation.

The broker said in its view recent investor concerns over debt repayments have been overstated. The
company has a $A110.2 million convertible bond due i July 2014 and a $A125 million bond due in July
2015. With cash of $94 million t end 2013, the broker expects WSA to close out the 2014 convertible
bond using cash and an undrawn $125 million facility. Also WSA has sufficient liquidity to repay the July
2015 convertible bond, although should prices move unfavorably, it is likely to be able to reset the 2015
convertible bond, removing any potential concerns about refinancing.
Company guidance: On February 10 Western Areas Ltd announced an upgraded guidance for the
financial year 2014 as a direct result of the continuing strong performance of the company's operations.
Mine production is upgraded to 27,000 tonnes of nickel in ore vs 25/26,000 tonnes originally guided.
Nickel in concentrate is upgraded to 25,000 tonnes from 23,000/24m tonnes.

Unit cash cost of production in concentrate has been lowered to $A2.70 per pound from $A2.80 /2.90 per
pound originally guided.
Capital expenditure and exploration costs remain at $60 million.

the final reading in January vs a fall to 80.6 expected.

*BBC news reported the eurozone's economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of 2013, up from
0.1% growth in the previous quarter. It was the third quarter of growth since the end of an 18-month

include 17 of the EU's economies. Latvia became the currency zone's 18th member in January.

Economic activity is still 2.7% below the peak it reached in 2008, before the full onset of the financial
crisis.

There is one small landmark in the new data - the Italian economy managed to grow for the first time since
mid-2011. But the rate was even more feeble than the eurozone average.

"The eurozone's recovery has moved up a gear," said Chris Williamson, chief economist of Markit.

"Not only has the pace of growth picked up to the fastest since the second quarter of 2011, but the
recovery is also becoming more broad-based, encompassing core and so-called 'periphery' countries
alike."

*In the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the construction sector grew by 0.2% in the 4th quarter of
last year vs a 0.3% contraction in earlier data.
