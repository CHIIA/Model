While a short squeeze exacerbated by options close off today may have contributed to the rally in our
market today, overseas markets last night also rose - with any fears of an early start to hiking US interest
rates put at rest by the sharp decline in the US GDP last night. It is also very close to the end of the
financial year and jockeying to hit the targeted close is likely to play a part.

"Bernborough" said, "I will call the market up about 10. There are 3 days to go and we will see what
happens. There are still buyers out there - everyone is hoping for a big pull back so they can buy. The

*AGK: ACT overturns ACCC's opposition to MacGen acquisition

Page136of235©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.AGL Energy Ltd announced it welcomes the decision by the Australian Competition Tribunal which
effectively overturns the ACCC's decision to oppose AGL's acquisition of the assets of Macquarie
Generation (MacGen).

The Tribunal reached the view that the proposed acquisiton is not likely to result in a signficant detriment
to teh ability of retailers, including small retailers to compete in the NSW electricity market. In additon the
Tribunal concludes that the acquisiton of MacGen by AGL would produce a vigorous competitive market.

The ACCC has limited grounds for appealing the decisio and a maximum period of 28 days in which to do
so. MacGen is the lowest cost, large scale baseload generator in NSW with a total capacity of
approximately 4,600MW. NSW is AGL's largest electricity market with over 800,000 customers. It does not
currently own any scheduled generation assets in NSW.
