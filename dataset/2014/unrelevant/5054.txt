Under the Subscription Agreements, the Stage 1 Placement is conditional upon
the following conditions ("Stage 1
Conditions"):

HEI having received all necessary regulatory approvals within the
People's Republic of China for it to
acquire its Placement Shares.

The Stage 1 Placement Shares will be issued and paid for within three
Business Days of the date on which CoAL
notifies the Placees that each of the Stage 1 Conditions has been satisfied.
If any of the Stage 1 Conditions has not been satisfied by 23 November 2014,
or such later date as the Company
and the Placees agree (not to be later than the Stage 2 Cut-Off Date, as
defined below), the Subscription
Agreements will automatically terminate and the Placement will not proceed.
Under the Subscription Agreements, the Stage 2 Placement is conditional upon
the following conditions ("Stage 2
Conditions"):
Completion Condition"); and
Placement Shares or the Company having

Company in respect of some or all of
Subscription Agreements ("TMM

completion of the Stage 1 Placement having taken place ("Stage 1
TMM having obtained sufficient funds to purchase its Stage 2
found a substitute investor or investors to subscribe for TMM's Stage
investor having entered into a subscription agreement with the
TMM's Stage 2 Placement Shares on substantially similar terms to the
Condition").

•
•

The Stage 2 Placement Shares will be issued and paid for within three
Business Days of the date on which CoAL
notifies the Placees that the TMM Condition has been satisfied (unless the
TMM Condition is satisfied before the
Stage 1 Completion Condition has been satisfied, in which case the Stage 2
Placement Shares will be issued and
paid for at the same time as the Stage 1 Placement Shares).
Under the Subscription Agreement with TMM, if TMM has not obtained sufficient
funds to purchase its Stage 2
Placement Shares by 1 December 2014, then the Company has the right to
terminate TMM's participation in the
Stage 2 Placement. In that case, the Company may seek to find one or more
other investors to take up TMM's
Stage 2 Placement Shares at the issue price of GBP0.055 per Share and
otherwise on substantially similar terms.
If the Stage 1 Completion Condition has been satisfied, but the TMM Condition
has not been satisfied, by the
earlier of (1) 24 December 2014 and (2) the date which is three Business Days
earlier than three months after the
date of the EGM (the "Stage 2 Cut-Off Date"), then the Stage 1 Placement will
proceed but the Stage 2 Placement
will not proceed.
The Company will notify ASX as and when it receives notice that a condition
has been fulfilled.
CoAL has given certain limited warranties to the Placees under the
Subscription Agreements ("Warranties"), and
each Placee has the right to terminate its participation in the Placement if
it becomes aware that there has been a
breach of any Warranty, or any fact or circumstance has arisen which would
render any of the Warranties untrue
or inaccurate or misleading in any respect which, in the reasonable opinion
of the relevant Placee, is material in

Page304of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.the context of its investment in CoAL, in each case as if the Warranties were
repeated at all times between the
date of the Subscription Agreements and completion of the relevant stage of
the Placement. If a Placee terminates
its Subscription Agreement before the Stage 1 Placement has completed, then
each other Placee will also have the
right to terminate its Subscription Agreement and the number of Placement
Shares may decrease accordingly or
the Placement may not proceed at all. If a Placee terminates its Subscription
Agreement after the Stage 1
Placement has completed, then each other Placee will have the right to
terminate its Subscription Agreement, but
only insofar as it relates to their participation in the Stage 2 Placement
and CoAL will be entitled to retain the
proceeds from the Stage 1 Placement.
The Company has been informed by each of HEI and M&G that they have sought
approval from the Foreign
Investment Review Board ("FIRB") for the acquisition of their respective
Placement Shares. The Company has
also been informed by HEI that it has submitted the necessary applications
for the regulatory approvals required
to satisfy the Stage 1 Conditions.

Use of Placement proceeds

Page305of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Subject to completion, the Company intends to use the proceeds raised from
the Placement primarily as follows:

•

•
•

•
•

tenements comprised in the Company's

Colliery;
or pay provisions of the throughput
Limitada and Grindrod Corridor

To settle the outstanding acquisition consideration of the
Greater Soutpansberg Projects;
To implement modifications to the existing plant at the Vele
To resolve the current contractual exposure resulting from the take
agreement between the Company, Terminal De Carvao Da Matola
Management Proprietary Limited;
To settle the Investec Bank Limited working capital facility in
To fund the Company's expected working capital requirements for the

accordance with its terms; and
next 18 months.
In addition to the Placement, the Company is seeking to secure funding from
the planned disposal of certain non-
core assets, including the Mooiplaats Colliery, within the next 18 months,
and is reliant on that funding as well as
the Placement proceeds to be able to achieve all of the uses stated above.
While the Directors are confident of
completing one or more of these planned disposals, there can be no guarantee
that any of these initiatives will be
successful. Further, even if successful, these planned disposals would not
provide all the funding required to
satisfy the Company's needs without the Placement.
If the Placement is not approved at the Meeting or does not proceed in whole
or in part for any other reason,
including as a result of any of the other Placement conditions not being
satisfied, or the Company is not able to
achieve the planned disposal of certain non-core assets including the
Mooiplaats Colliery (whether at all or for the
expected amount) within the next 18 months, the Company will need to seek
funding from other sources to meet
its future capital expenditure and working capital needs. While the Company
is confident of being able to obtain
substitute funding if the planned disposal of certain non-core assets
including the Mooiplaats Colliery does not
go ahead, it would be significantly more challenging to obtain alternative
funding if the Placement proceeds are
not received in full, and there can be no guarantee that such funding will be
available at all or that, if available, it
will be on terms which are commercially acceptable to the Company. It is
therefore vitally important to the
continued operation of the Company that shareholders vote in favour of
Resolution 1 at the Meeting.

If Stage 2 Placement does not proceed
In the event that TMM is not able to obtain sufficient funds to purchase its
Stage 2 Placement Shares, the

Page306of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Company has the right to terminate TMM's participation in the Stage 2
Placement and is confident that
alternative methods could be implemented to obtain the funds that would
otherwise have been provided by
TMM.
In particular, the Company has already engaged with third parties who, for
timing reasons, have been unable to
participate in the Placement and who could possibly absorb TMM's Stage 2
Placement Shares if needed.
Additionally, the Company has the ability to issue up to 15% of the Company's
total issued share capital without
requiring further shareholder approval, which could be utilised if the Stage
2 Placement does not proceed.
The Directors only intend to progress these alternative funding options if
the Placement cannot proceed as
currently planned. There is no current intention to obtain additional funding
beyond the Placement proceeds and
the proceeds of planned asset disposals as described above.
RESOLUTION 1 - APPROVAL OF ISSUE OF PLACEMENT SHARES
Resolution 1 seeks shareholder approval to the issue of a maximum of
695,000,000 Shares at an issue price of GBP
0.055 per Share.
Listing Rule 7.1 requires shareholder approval for the proposed Placement.
Listing Rule 7.1 broadly provides,
subject to certain exceptions, that a listed company must not, without prior
approval of its shareholders, issue
securities if the number of securities issued, or when aggregated with the
number of securities issued by the
company during the previous 12 months, exceeds 15% of the number of
securities on issue at the commencement
of that 12 month period.
Given the issue of the Placement Shares under the Placement will exceed this
15% threshold and none of the
exceptions in Listing Rule 7.2 apply, shareholder approval is required in
accordance with Listing Rule 7.1.
The effect of Resolution 1 will be to allow the Company to issue the
Placement Shares during the period of 3
months after the date of the Meeting (or a longer period if allowed by ASX),
without using the Company's 15%
annual placement capacity, if the other Placement conditions are satisfied or
waived (if applicable).
The following information in relation to the Placement Shares is provided to
shareholders for the purposes of
Listing Rule 7.3:
