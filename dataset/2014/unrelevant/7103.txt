The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close mildly higher today.

Europe closed mixed in a narrow range, the UK market closed slightly lower, the US markets were slightly
higher.

On the NYSE where 3229 issues traded there were 1,623 issues higher, 1,502 down and 104 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2743 issues traded there were 1,468 issues higher, 1,188 down and 87 unchanged.

*Volume was low in all overseas markets.
Metals were weaker, iron ore rose, crude fell a touch, gold was slightly lower. The $A is at 92.78US c, up
a few from last evening.

"Support at 5430 then at 5400, resistance at 5450 then 5465 .. I'll call it up 10"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500 last night had a 10 point range in a pretty
quiet night, however closing at a record high, not far off intra day highs. For the S&P500 the picture looks
as good as it can be on the technical charts. There are no real areas of resistance given it is testing new
highs - 1930 may offer resistance.
"Spot gold is consolidating around 1240/1245. I expect a dead cat bounce at some stage.
"Copper was a bit weaker last night, broke the $3.12/lb level of support. It needs to hold the $3.09/lb level
or could head back to $3/lb.

"It was a pretty uneventful night on the Euro last night, awaiting the ECB meeting tonight.
"US bond yields ticked slightly higher, now sitting just at the 2.6% level - the sell off in bonds continues.
"China yesterday broke back below the 20 day moving average. The consolidation there has broken down
negatively. Support now is at 2010. The critical level of support is 2000. If we see 2000 broken, it may
head back to the lows of March of 1980.

"The Japanese market remains very strong, it has closed above 15,000 for two consecutive days. It has
quite a bullish chart.

"The XJO broke down yesterday below the 20 day moving average, it also broke the 50 day moving
average for the first time since early May.

"It is short term bearish. For the week we really need to see 5430 hold in my view otherwise we could
break down to the previous May lows. Any break of 5400 would see the market potentially test 5300 over
the coming weeks. However there is good support at 5430 and then at 5400. Resistance is now at 5450
followed by 5465.

Page191of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."For the day, under performance on our market has been pretty much every day this week. I expect us to
take back some of that today. I will call us up 10 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 34.9 points to 5444.8, 2 points last evening.

Austrian biotech Affiris patents a drug against Alzheimer's it discovered by chance
Handelsblatt reports Austrian biotech companyAffiris claims to have discovered a drug against
Alzheimer's by chance according to own data. "Just as the invention of penicillin was random, so it is also
in our case," CEO Walter Schmidt said on Wednesday. The substance AD04 had been used in a research
study against a placebo.

By chance, the Viennese researchers recognized the action against the dementia Alzheimer's disease.
The new agent has according to the company two effects: it stabilizes the power of memory and stops
shrinkage of the hippocampus. Its effect was especially pronounced in patients in the early stage.

Affiris is alredy in talks with major pharmas and financial companies, Affiris CEO Schmidt told Handelsblatt
last night, adding that the drug could reach the market in less than five years.

He would not comment on the possible price.
The market for a drug against Alzheimer's disease is calculated at Euro 4/5 billion, Handelsblatt added.

Affiris, founded in 2003 has financial investor MIG Funds as a major shareholders, also venture capital
firm Santo VC held by the twins Thomas and Andreas Strungmann who sold their pharmaceutical
company Hexal nine years ago for Euro 5.9 million to Novartis.

G7 talks on Russia, Climate Change

Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), reiterated that if the talks in the G7 summit in Brussels did not go well,
there was the threat of sanctions against Russia. She said talks with Russia should continue at the same
time.

The German Chancellor also said the US and the UK were also responsible for the destabilisaiton in
eastern Ukraine.
The G7 will also decide on common positions for free trade, increased energy security and the
preservation of international law in Brussels, Chancellor Merkel announced. At the same time they again
called for greater regulation of so-called shadow banks.

Page196of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy stressed at the same time, Russia was not excluded from this
summit, permanently from the Group of Eight (G-8). However, it is still too early to decide whether, when
and under what conditions can Russia take part again.
On energy, the Chancellor referred to decisions of the G7 ministers: "By 2015, they want to develop a
comprehensive, long-term action plan, which seeks to prevent that energy is used as a political means of
coercion," Merkel said, referring to the Russian-Ukrainian dispute to gas supplies.

New climate policy to limit emissions of greenhouse gases

In addition, the G7 countries want a new start in climate policy and the limitation of emissions of
greenhouse gases. At the World Climate Conference in 2015 a binding agreement must be stipulated
which should enter into force by 2020, Merkel said.

Much more has to be done to limit global warming to two degrees, she warned.
