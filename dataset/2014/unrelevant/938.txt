* Planned business spending in Australia for 2014/15 upgraded

* Aussie up a quarter of a U.S. cent

* 10-yr government bond yields at lowest in over a year

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar received a boost on Thursday after
a better-than-expected outlook for business investment leant hope the economy could weather an
ongoing pullback in the mining sector, hoisting the New Zealand dollar higher.

The Australian dollar powered up to $0.9360, from $0.9336 in early trade. It climbed to a three-week
peak of $0.9373, where it met heavy resistance.

"Both the Aussie and bonds reacted to the headline print, but details were mixed," said Su-Lin Ong,
senior economist at RBC Capital Markets in Australia.
Planned spending for 2014/15 was upgraded to A$145.2 billion, topping analysts estimates of around
A$142 billion. However, there is a risk that gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter, due
out next week, could show a contraction, partly due to consumer caution.

Not helping is a 0.9 percent decline in plant and equipment spending, which could also drag on
economic growth.

Still, some economists are guardedly optimistic.

"The better print for the actual quarter and some signs that non-mining investments are picking up are
encouraging," Ong said, keeping her GDP forecast at 0.5 percent for the second quarter.

The Aussie had already been underpinned by demand from carry trade investors, borrowing in euro to
buy higher-yielding Aussie assets. The euro slipped to A$1.4110, very near 10-month lows, with
charts suggesting more downside. Initial support was found at A$1.4087.

The common currency is down 2 percent this month largely due to growing expectations of another
round of policy easing by the European Central Bank.

The Aussie kept near multi-month highs versus the yen, pound Swiss franc and its kiwi neighbour.

The New Zealand dollar traded around $0.8384, and up from the week's trough of $0.8311.
It was supported after dairy exporter Fonterra, New Zealand's largest company, on Wednesday
announced a tie-up with a Chinese firm which could boost its branded infant formula sales in the
Chinese market.
Fonterra, the world's largest dairy exporter, also stuck to its milk price forecast for the current year.
There had been concerns it would lower the payout given an ongoing slide in global prices for dairy,
the country's biggest export earner.

post-float high on a trade-weighted basis.

Technical support was seen at $0.8353, the 61.8 percent retracement of the kiwi's February-July rally,
and below that at $0.8311.

New Zealand government bonds rose, pushing yields as much as 4 basis points lower across the
curve.

Australian government bond futures were split, with the three-year bond contract down 1 tick at
97.370. The 10-year contract added 4 ticks to 96.720, very near a 14-month peak, with the yield curve
flattening.
