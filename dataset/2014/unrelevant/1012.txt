Sydney (Platts)--1Apr2014/1020 pm EDT/220 GMT (Updates with detail throughout)
BP Australia will cease refining at its 102,000 b/d Bulwer Island oil refinery in the east coast city of
Brisbane by mid-2015, company president Andy Holmes told a live broadcast press conference in
Melbourne Wednesday.

"Over the years we have invested heavily in Bulwer," Holmes said. "A major upgrade [in 2000] to make
low sulfur fuels was about trying to improve our competitive position, but the business environment has
changed. The emergence of very large, modern export-based refineries in Asia that can operate at a
much lower cost base has transformed the industry and presented the Bulwer operation with an
insurmountable challenge."

Holmes said the decision would not impact Australia's energy security.

"Australia is well served by diverse, regionally integrated and reliable supply chains. We know from
experience that these supply chains have effectively and efficiently delivered competitively priced fuels to
customers through disruptions and through the demand growth that we've experienced both domestically
and in China," he said.

"Also, as Australia is a price taker in the region, the decision whether to refine or to import petrol does not
have an impact on Australia's wholesale or retail fuel prices."

BP also operates a 146,000 b/d oil refinery at Kwinana in Western Australia, which Holmes said had an
advantage in both the feedstock it could process and its ability to produce modern, high-octane fuel.

"Provided [Kwinana] continues to deliver best in class safety and reliability performance and it continues
to improve its efficiency, we believe it has a strong future," Holmes said.

He conceded however, the BP could not give "open-ended commitments to any parts" of its business.

Australia's refining and marketing sector has undergone significant restructuring in recent years. The
industry is characterized by aged facilities with capacities of around 100,000 b/d and all four domestic
refiners -- BP, Caltex, ExxonMobil and Shell -- have struggled to compete with new, larger plants
operating in the Asian region.
Bulwer Island will be the fourth of Australia's original eight oil refineries to close.

ExxonMobil mothballed its 78,000 b/d refinery at Port Stanvac in South Australia in mid-2003, and Caltex
is implementing plans to convert its 135,000 b/d facility at Kurnell in Sydney into an import terminal later
this year.

Shell Australia converted its 79,000 b/d refinery at Clyde in Sydney into an import terminal in September
2012 and two months ago, the company sold its 120,000 b/d Geelong plant and 870-site service station
network to European trader Vitol for $2.6 billion.

According to figures from the refining industry's Australian Institute of Petroleum, national consumption of
oil products was 949,500 b/d in the financial year ended June 30, 2013. The domestic refineries
produced 635,900 b/d of products, of which around 9% was exported, with net imports from more than
20 countries accounting for about 40%, or 387,800 b/d, of total consumption.

import facilities around Australia's coast, to take advantage of the supply overhang in the region.

"In future, the industry will channel investment into product imports and distribution infrastructure and
sharing, rather than duplicating, should be the norm," he said.

CALTEX TO SUPPLY GASOLINE, DIESEL

In a separate statement, Caltex Australia said it had signed an agreement to supply BP with gasoline and
diesel from Brisbane's other refinery, the 109,000 b/d facility it operates at Lytton. The supply contract
will "provide ongoing safe and reliable supply to BP, and enable Caltex to place more of its Lytton
refinery production in Brisbane," Caltex CEO and Managing Director Julian Segal said.

In order to supply BP's terminal on the north side of the Brisbane River, a new pipeline and associated
works costing around A$30 million ($28 million) will be constructed by Caltex from its Lytton refinery and
fuel storage facilities on the south side of the river.

Holmes said alternate arrangements would also be made to import jet fuel.
The company added that it expected the implementation of changes required to maintain supply and
safely shut down the process units would take around 12 months.

Once processing has been halted, the import jetty, aviation fuel tanks and associated pipelines will
remain operational while other storage tanks and pipelines will be placed on a care and maintenance
basis pending a decision to convert the site to a multi-product import terminal, BP said. Holmes added
that in the medium term there was a "very strong case" to convert Bulwer Island into a full import
terminal.

BP's current staff of around 380 at the refinery is expected to fall to about 25 after the closure. The plant
also employs around 300 contractors, some of whom will be retained.

Australia's wholesale and retail sector has also seen rationalization and increased entry by independents
and international players. The number of retail sites across the country has decreased from 20,000 in
1970 to around 6,300 in 2013, although the reduction in numbers has plateaued since the mid-2000s.

BP supplies transport fuels to around 1,300 service stations, and has a 15% share of the Australian retail
fuel market by brand.
