Australian buyout shop Pacific Equity Partners on Monday arranged the latest of a series of exits with a
deal to sell New Zealand portfolio company Griffin's Food Ltd. to Manila-listed Universal Robina Corp.
for NZ$700 million ($608 million).
The deal follows Pacific Equity initial public offerings for toilet paper maker Asaleo Care Ltd. and
catering and cleaning services companySpotless Group Ltd. this year and its sale in May of Australia's
Peters Food Group Ltd. to PAI PartnersSAS portfolio companyR&R Ice Cream plc for a price known to
be about A$450 million ($422 million).

Griffin's makes cookies, potato chips and biscuits under brands including Cookie Bear, Huntley &
Palmers and Nice & Natural. United Robina said the purchase will be "value accretive," noting that
Griffin's had sales last year of NZ$280 million and Ebitda of NZ$78 million.

It will use long-term debt to help fund the takeover.

The deal is one of several involving the acquisition of Australian or New Zealand foodmakers by
international buyers who have in their sights the enormous Chinese market, where Western brands can
command premium prices.
Recent such deals include Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. and Hong Kong's First Pacific Co.
Ltd.'s A$1.32 billion agreement to buy baker and dairy companyGoodman Fielder Ltd. in May and the
January victory of Canada's Saputo Inc. in a long-running bid battle for Warrnambool Cheese & Butter
Factory Co.
"We believe Griffin's is a natural strategic fit to our existing snack foods portfolio given its strong brand
heritage in New Zealand — a country trusted worldwide in having high credibility when it comes to food
quality, safety and authenticity," said Universal Robina president and CEO Lance Gokongwei in a
statement. "The global trend of snacking is fast transforming the sector and our plan is to continue
offering our consumers in Asia new and exciting premium brands such as Griffin's Biscuits, ETA Salty
Snacks and Nice & Natural Wrapped Snacks."
Universal Robina had a market value of 344.7 billion pesos ($7.9 billion) as of Monday's close and had
revenue last year of P81 billion. It is 60.5%-owned by separately listed JG Summit Holdings Inc.
Pacific Equity Partners bought Griffin's from Groupe Danone SA for $385 million in 2006. Pacific Equity
Partners managing director David Brown said Griffin's had increased its Ebitda "substantially" under the
firm's ownership through initiatives including the establishment of two manufacturing "supercenters," the
formation of an export division and the purchase of nut bar maker Nice & Natural.

It didn't say what it made on the Griffin's investment.

The transaction requires New Zealand government clearance under the 2005 Overseas Investment Act
2005.
Credit Suisse Group and First NZ Capital advised Pacific Equity Partners.
