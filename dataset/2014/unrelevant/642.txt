Confidence in the ability of global central bank stimulus to keep equity prices levitating saw the
Australian sharemarket shrug off tumbling iron ore prices and the US dollar-driven rout in currency
and commodity markets.
On Thursday night, equity markets received a surprise shot in the arm after the European Central
Bank monetary policy statement said there was “unanimous” board member support to use
“unconventional instruments within its mandate” to counter prolonged low inflation “should it become
necessary”.

The news, coming just a week after the Bank of Japan’s expanded quantitative easing program, gave
fresh impetus to the reversal of global currency flows towards the recently reviled US dollar following
the end of US Federal Reserve bond-buying stimulus.

The S&P-ASX 200 index climbed 43 points, or 0.78 per cent, to 5549.1 on volume 25 per cent above
average as mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto continued to defy the nosedive in iron ore prices
that has dragged their higher-cost rivals down in its wake.

The two large-cap miners were also likely supported by strategist reports the Japanese Government
Pension Investment Fund would diversify about $220 billion of its holdings away from Japanese
bonds to “liquid” foreign equities over the next two to three years.
Spot iron ore fell 1.3 per cent to a five-year low of $US75.40 a tonne on Thursday and Dalian iron ore
futures were up 0.2 per cent yesterday.
Gold dropped $US9 to a four-year low of $US1133 an ounce and Brent crude oil lost 0.6 per cent to
$US82.40 a barrel.

The Australian dollar fell US0.8¢ to a four-year low of US85.40¢ as the euro dropped and the US dollar
resumed its rally following solid US data. Government 10-year yields jumped 10.7 points to 3.354 per
cent.

“Much of the rise in the US dollar to date reflects weaker trends in the yen and euro, some swooning
emerging market currencies — the Russian rouble and Brazilian real — and weaker growth outcomes
in China holding back commodity currencies,” Royal Bank of Scotland currency strategist Greg Gibbs
said. “The market is in tune with a better-performing US economy, but it is yet to buy into a sustained
upbeat outlook that brings forward Fed policy tightening.”

US weekly jobless claims dropped to 278,000, one of the lowest readings this century, while the
average was at 2005 levels.

But National Australia Bank global head of currency strategy Ray Attrill noted the US unemployment
rate was 4 per cent back then, compared with the current 5.9 per cent. Benchmark US 10-year yields
remained unconvinced on the growth outlook, rising 3 points to 2.386 per cent.

People’s Bank of China confirmed rumours last month it had injected ¥770 billion ($140 billion) into
the country’s major banks.

Explaining fading growth indicators, the PBOC statement said the funding was mostly to offset
declining foreign capital and exporter capital inflows.

“It shows the central bank is very reluctant to loosen monetary policy, but it has to reduce financing
costs for end borrowers,” Minsheng Securities chief macro-economic researcher Guan Qingyou told
Bloomberg.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei index climbed 0.5 per cent as the yen hit a fresh seven-year low.
