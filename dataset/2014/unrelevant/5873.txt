Australian gas producer Origin Energy has agreed to farm into two gas-prone areas in the highly
prospective Cooper Basin in Central Australia.
Under the agreement, Origin will acquire an initial 40% stake in parts of exploration concessions PEL
516 and PEL 115, known as Area A, and a 30% stake in parts of PEL 514, known as Area B, with an
option to later increase its working interest in both areas by another 10% and become operator.

Independent exploration company Senex is operator with a 100% working interest in Area A and an
80% interest in Area B where its partner is Sydney-based independent Planet Gas.
Area A covers two areas south and east of the gas and oil processing center of Moomba, while Area B
lies north of the hub.
Origin will invest an initial A$97 ($87) million on exploration on the blocks and a further A$72 million if
it exercises its option. Senex will initially remain operator of the two areas, which cover some 1,900 sq
km.

Senex will retain operatorship of the permits during the two-stage work program, with Origin having the
option to become operator thereafter. The Area B farm-out is restricted to the concession's deeper
gas-prone structures. Senex will retain its interest in the oil-prone shallows.
The joint venture's spending could total A$252 million, with Senex's share 100% free carried up to
A$185 million on the agreed initial two-stage work program and Senex, Origin and Planet having the
option to contribute an additional A$67 million on a participating interest basis if an additional work
program is approved.
The two companies said they expect the transaction to close by end June.
Origin, together with joint venture partners ConocoPhillips and China's Sinopec, is developing Australia
Pacific LNG, one of three LNG export projects being built on Curtis Island off the port of Gladstone in
Queensland, eastern Australia. Gas demand for the projects, plus delays to coalbed methane
exploration and production in eastern Australia, have seen the three projects' developers look further
afield for supplies.
Origin said its $22.3 billion, 9 million mt/year APLNG project was 60% complete and on track to deliver
its first cargo in mid-2015.
"We are pleased to be working with Senex Energy given its proven track record operating in one of
Australia's largest onshore hydrocarbon provinces," Origin's upstream CEO Paul Zealand said February
24.

Senex managing director Ian Davies said: "Origin is a natural partner for Senex to accelerate
commercialization of a potentially massive gas resource."

the first half of its 2014 financial year. The company said its net half-year production fell 1.5% year on
year to 650,000 barrels, equivalent to about 3,550 b/d. "We expect production to increase in the
remainder of FY14 following drilling success across our high margin Cooper-Eromanga oil fields,"
Davies said.

Untapped resources

The Origin-Senex deal is the latest in a growing list focusing on the Cooper Basin's largely untapped
unconventional hydrocarbon resources.

Consultancy RISC has estimated Australia's unrisked tight gas and shale gas resource potential could
be around 230 Tcf, including 44 Tcf in the Cooper and partially overlapping Eromanga Basin.
Last year the CEO of Real Energy, Scott Brown, said he estimated the basin holds more than 100 Tcf
of unconventional gas and admitted he was preparing the company to be taken over.

In 2012, Bernstein Research wrote: "While it remains too early to tell who will be the winners in the race
for Australian shale, we favor E&P [companies] with exposure to the Cooper Basin."

In mid-2011, BG's Australian subsidiary QGC formed a joint venture with Australia's Drillsearch to
explore for shale and tight gas in Cooper Basin.
Santos, which operates the Moomba oil and gas processing facility, produced Australia's first
commercial shale gas at its Moomba-191 field in late 2012.

But Senex is the basin's largest operator by area, with almost 11,000 sq km under its operatorship.
Other recent Cooper basin deals include last month's farm-in by New Standard Energy to Ambassador
Oil & Gas' Cooper Basin exploration permit PEL 570. In December 2013 US shale pioneer Magnum
Hunter Resources became New Standard's largest shareholder.
