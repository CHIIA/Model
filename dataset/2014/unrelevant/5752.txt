SYDNEY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - London copper was on Tuesday holding 1-percent gains notched up the
session before after the dollar suffered its biggest one-day drop in a year, alleviating pressure on
commodities.

FUNDAMENTALS
* Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was little changed at $6,712.50 a tonne by
1220 GMT. Prices are slowly edging away from 5-month lows at $6,600 a tonne hit Oct. 2.
* China markets, including the Shanghai Futures Exchange are closed from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7 for the
National Day holiday. They will resume trade on Wednesday.

* The dollar nursed heavy losses early on Tuesday, having suffered its biggest one-day fall in a year
as it reversed almost all of its U.S. payrolls-inspired gains in a temporary setback for dollar bulls.

* An influential Federal Reserve policymaker said he would be "delighted" to raise interest rates some
time next year since it would be a sign of economic success, but for now a "very accommodative
monetary policy" is still needed.

* Most euro zone bond yields fell on Monday after data showing German industrial orders dropped at
their fastest rate since 2009 in August revived expectations of further monetary easing.
* Rio Tinto rejected a merger approach from smaller rival Glencore Plc to create a $160 billionmining
and trading giant in August, the world No.2 miner said on Tuesday, following media reports on
Glencore's ambitious plan.
