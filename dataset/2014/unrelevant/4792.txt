takeovers: China’s Fosun International has built up a 29.3 per cent stake in Roc Oil, after the
company’s biggest shareholder, Allan Gray, accepted Fosun’s offer.

It is understood fund manager Allan Gray, with nearly 20 per cent in Roc, accepted the 69c a share
offer last night. The offer values Roc at $474 million.

Roc’s second-biggest shareholder, Dialog Group, also accepted the offer. This may trigger an
accelerated acceptance from hedge fund shareholders in Roc, and bring Fosun closer to the 50.01
per cent acceptance threshold.Roc recommended the Fosun offer in August, abandoning an $800m
merger plan with Horizon Oil.
