@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;Australian food manufacturer Goodman Fielder was
considering a sweetened bid from an Asian consortium yesterday that values the company at A$1.37
billion (Bt41.4 billion) after rejecting an earlier offer.

Goodman Fielder went into a trading halt on Thursday after Singapore-based agribusiness Wilmar
International and Hong Kong-based investment manager First Pacific Company lifted their takeover
offer from 65 cents a share to 70 cents.

"The company and First Pacific will not increase the price further in the absence of a competing
proposal," Wilmar said in a statement.
The Australian firm owns food brands including Helga's, MeadowLea and Wonder White.

@HD2 New Briefs head;Temasek buys into VMLA
@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;Singapore's state investment firmTemasek Holdings has
invested in Virgin Mobile Latin America (VMLA) in its latest move to extend its global reach into other
regions and sectors.
The wealth fund giant confirmed it was the lead investor in a new round of capital funding for VMLA
totalling US$86 million (Bt2.7 billion).
"The equity will help launch the Virgin Mobile brand in Mexico in 2014 and Brazil in 2015," Temasek
said in a statement. It said the investment would also "fund growth and expansion opportunities as they
arise in the region, including the company's existing operations in Chile and Colombia".

Tweaking its global portfolio, Temasek has recently invested substantially in emerging sectors such as
retail and African resources as it reduces heavy reliance on the financial sector. The telecoms, media
and technology sector make up 24 per cent of Temasek's S$215 billion (Bt5.5 trillion) global portfolio,
compared with 31 per cent in financials.
