By David Winning

SYDNEY--PanAust Ltd. (PNA.AU) said Tuesday its majority-owned Frieda River copper-and-gold
mining project in Papua New Guinea could cost US$1.7 billion to build.
PanAust--currently a takeover target for China's Guangdong Rising Assets Management--said Frieda
River could produce 125,000 tons of copper-in-concentrate, and 200,000 ounces of gold, annually.
Brisbane-based PanAust recently acquired an 80% stake in the Frieda River project from Glencore
PLC (GLEN.LN). The remaining interest is held by Australia-listed Highlands Pacific Ltd. (HIG.AU).
"Preliminary analysis indicates that the base case development concept would be robust at a copper
price of US$2.80 per pound and gold price of US$1,300 a troy ounce," PanAust said in a statement.

PanAust, which is preparing a feasibility study into the Frieda River project, said the initial
construction-cost estimate didn't include a fleet of mining trucks or a power plant.
