Tiaro Coal said Tuesday that Singapore-listed ICP has bought a 19.9% stake in the Australian miner for
A$3 million ($2.82 million), which will help the company develop its Paragon coking coal mine in
Queensland. ICP already has a 11.9% stake in Tiaro's subsidiary company, Paragon Coal, which is
developing the mine in the Marybourough coal basin. The rest of Paragon Coal is held by Tiaro (47.6%)
and Chinese coal producer and trader China Qinfa Group (40.5%). China Qinfa also has a 19.88%
stake in Tiaro. "The acquisition will also be a catalyst for a strategic relationship with China Qinfa Group
Limited (Qinfa), a group that has coal trading and coal mining assets in China, which may bring further
opportunities in the development of coal resources across Asia and Australia," ICP Chairman Mick Aw
said in the statement. The Paragon metallurgical coal project is expected to start producing at a rate of
5.5 million mt/year.

Tiaro Coal Managing Director Dan Buckley said in November last year the company was expecting to
start production at Paragon in 2016, after securing mining and environmental approvals over 2014-2015.
But Tiaro said Tuesday a start date for production has not yet been firmed up. A pre-feasibility study for
Paragon was started in February and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Tiaro is also
developing several metallurgical coal projects in Queensland, including the Burrum and Clyde Park
projects, as well as the Anggana coal project in Indonesia's East Kalimantan.
