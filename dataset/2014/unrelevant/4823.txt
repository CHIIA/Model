China Construction Bank – the sixth largest bank in the world by market capitalisation – has leased
an entire boutique building in Brisbane's central business district.
The bank, which was initially looking to buy the asset, has taken a seven-year lease over 340
Queen Street at a high rent compared with the rest of the market.

The bank will pay more than $800 a square metre for the B-grade building on a gross effective
basis with no incentives from the landlord.

By comparison, the premium-grade 480 Queen Street has been doing deals on a gross effective
rent of between $650 and $700 a square metre a year with an incentive of close to 35 per cent.

CCB has taken the space in preparation for the G20 summit in November but the bank was unable
to make a statement on the deal.
The asset, which covers only 720 square metres, has also just been sold to local syndicator Trident
Corporation for more than $5 million.
JLL's Seb Turnbull negotiated the asset sale while Knight Frank's Tom O'Driscoll introduced the
bank.
Less than 100 metres away from the CCB's new premises, Bank of China has already taken up to
300 square metres of ground floor and mezzanine-level space in 307 Queen Street. That bank has
an estimated 10,000 Chinese customers in the state.
Chinese businesses and investors have been flooding into the Australian property market but both
Brisbane and the Gold Coast are only just starting to milk the benefits.
This week China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, committed $HK12.5 billion ($1.7 billion) to Australia
real estate, including constructing a $900 million beachfront resort on the Gold Coast.
