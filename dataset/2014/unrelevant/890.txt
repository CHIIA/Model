Mining magnate Gina Rinehart’s foray into the beef industry has expanded, with the purchase of a
major wagyu herd in western NSW.
A company associated with Ms Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting has struck an agreement to buy two
grazing properties near Dubbo and about 3000 head of cattle, including 1600 full-blood wagyu
females.

“This is part of Gina Rinehart’s commitment to invest in Australian agriculture and ensure the country
is positioned to meet the demands of our northern neighbours,” a spokesman for Hancock Prospecting
said.

The deal would likely make Ms Rinehart the second- largest wagyu producer in the country, behind
Australian Agricultural Company, which exports the majority of its high-quality beef to northern and
South East Asia.

Ms Rinehart is also understood to be close to finalising the acquisition of four more beef cattle stations
in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.Australia’s richest person also recently reached
agreement with the Queensland Government over a $500 million dairy export deal into the Chinese
infant formula market.
