DAIRY farmers are making 25 per cent more money than they were last year, but the increased
cashflow is going to pay creditors or reduce debt, Dairy Australia says.
The organisation's Situation and Outlook update, released yesterday, reports that farm gate milk
prices are up about 25 per cent on last season and the outlook for global demand for dairy,
particularly in China, remains robust.

Global dairy demand remains on a steady footing despite pricing at near record levels and
production shortfalls in China and Russia have boosted demand in those markets.

South-east Asia is showing steady growth despite localised challenges, and exports to South
Korea should benefit from the yet to be ratified Korea-Australia free trade agreement.
Australia's milk production so far this season is down on the same period in 2012/13 and is
expected to finish the year the same or slightly lower than 2012/13. The shortfall is due largely to
ongoing issues from the challenging second half of 2013.
Dairy Australia is forecasting milk production of 9.0-9.2 billion litres for the 2013/14 season.

"Poor weather has been a constraining factor, particularly in northern regions, as have lower in-calf
rates and pasture damage," Dairy Australia commercial and research analysis manager Norman
Repacholi said.
"But as the season progresses, confidence will likely firm with the farm gate price and this will
provide the latitude to capture some production opportunities," Mr Repacholi said.

"Processors will attempt to adjust product mix to maximise returns where contractual arrangements
permit, still, lower than expected production could mean delays in fulfilling orders.

"At the same time, producers focused on Australia's domestic market have not seen the same, if
any jump in milk price as those experienced by dairy producers in export focused regions. They
are also still facing cost pressures as a result of unfavourable weather or tight regional hay and
grain supplies," he said.
Mr Repacholi said Australian dairy heifer exports were still in high demand, with live cattle exports
up 12 per cent to about 85,000 head in the year to November 2013, with China the major buyer (79
per cent) followed by Pakistan (10 per cent) and Russia (4 per cent).

On global currency movements, the weaker Australian dollar is likely to place upward price
pressure on imports such as fertiliser, fuel and grain prices.
"Despite last season's challenges, Australian dairy has scored international headlines with the
competition to acquire Warrnambool Cheese and Butter (WCB) and a rush of other major
transactions," Mr Repacholi said.
