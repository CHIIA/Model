RWE (CM) Orbite Receives First $6 Million Installment of Quebec Investment Tax Credits

Sydney - Tuesday - July 22 (RWE) - Orbite Aluminae Inc [TSX:ORT] announced today it has received a
first installment of $6 million related to its 2012 Quebec Investment Tax Credits.

The funds were due to the Corporation in relation to equipment purchased for manufacturing and
processing in the Gaspe region during the 2012 financial year.

This first $6 million and subsequent funds the Corporation receives upon reimbursement of the 2012 and
2013 investment tax credits will be deposited in a segregated account and serve as security for the
convertible debentures issued in 2012.

The Corporation anticipates receiving the balance of its 2012 investment tax credits during the remainder
of 2014, with payments for 2013 expected in 2015.

Prior to this payment, the Corporation had a balance of $27.7 million in Quebec Investment Tax Credits to
be received, of which $19.7 million relates to the 2012 financial year, $6 million to the 2013 financial year,
and $2 million for 2014 as of the date hereof.

The Corporation anticipates accruing another $2.3 million during the remainder of 2014 such that total
Quebec Investment Tax Credits under this program should reach approximately $30 million following
completion of its HPA facility at Cap-Chat.
