NEW HOMES

Whether it's inner-city living, a place by the beach, or somewhere close to nature, Sydney has it all.

Ask a Sydneysider what are the best suburbs to live in and you'll receive a broad variety of answers.
Although famous for its harbour, Sydney is also blessed with beautiful beaches, pristine bushland,
lakeside areas and even mountains bordering the edge of our urban sprawl.

Domain has found three new developments in vastly different areas of our fair city, all with plenty of
lifestyle attractions on offer.
Nature lovers have their last opportunity to buy into new, architecturally designed digs on the edge of
Lane Cove National Park. Defence Housing Australia is developing a community in Lindfield that
borders bushland and is just four kilometres from the thriving hub of Chatswood.

Known as Crimson Hill, the community will eventually be home to 700 people across five precincts of
houses and apartments. Communal public spaces include a FIFA-certified football oval, a community
centre and walkways among native landscaping.

The developers are aiming for a 5-star Green Star rating. The final release is Shout Ridge, a selection
of 47 apartments, which is being launched on November 29. Blending into the natural environment,
two low-rise buildings designed by Architectus will be oriented to take in the bushland views and
benefit from cross-flow ventilation.

Each building has two distinctly different facades. At street entry, strong symmetrical lines rise over
three floors to the top levels where soaring, cantilevered, timber-clad rooflines are angled to the north.
The other side of the buildings features elegantly curved balconies overlooking the national parkland.
Broad eaves protect the interiors from the elements.

The managing director of DHA, Peter Howman, says Shout Ridge delivers a stand-out design,
architecturally and environmentally. "[It] is the perfect demonstration of how we've combined great
design and a leading approach to environmental sustainability," he says.

For buyers who like the pace of inner city life, enjoy a harbourside location and want to be within
walking distance of the city, a new project at Pyrmont, Pier 99 is due for completion in 18 months. The
six-storey complex of 73 apartments is set to benefit from the largest urban renewal program in
Sydney since the 2000 Olympics.

Pyrmont is part of The Bays Precinct which extends along Blackwattle, Rozelle and White bays. This is
the third stage in the renewal program following Barangaroo and Darling Harbour.

Director of CBRE, Murray Wood, says there is a paucity of development sites on the bays. While Pier
99 isn't harbourfront - it's just across the road - Wood says, "It's a wonderful opportunity for buyers to
benefit in the revitalisation of the area."

from Wentworth Park light rail station. The project is a collaboration between Chinaventure, Galaxy
Capital, VIMG and SIV. The building will be raised above a podium and is across the road from the
Sydney Fish Markets which are also earmarked for improvement.

For those who like to start the day with a surf, Manly on Sydney's northern beaches allows residents to
lap up the good life before taking the ferry to work in the city. A new complex of 18 apartments is
planned for a site a couple of minutes' walk from the sand.

"It's incredibly rare to find new product within two blocks of the beach," says Haig Conolly of Lloyds
Property. "The apartments have been designed to suit an indoor-outdoor lifestyle with all having
outside areas." There's also plenty of room for residents to store surfboards and bikes.

Zinc Apartments will be four minutes' walk to the ferry wharf and three minutes from The Corso.

Shout Ridge, Crimson Hill

98 Eton Road, Lindfield
Positioned four kilometres from Chatswood and bordering the Lane Cove National Park, Shout Ridge
is the last release in the Crimson Hill masterplan. The 47 architecturally designed one-and
two-bedroom apartments across two buildings will be offered for sale on November 29. One-beds
(from 62 square metres) from $585,000 and two-beds (82 square metres-plus) from $765,000. Strata
levies from about $630pq. Due for completion mid-2016. Phone 1800 918 978, crimsonhill.com.au.

CASE STUDY

Bush-edge haven

Having raised five children in a Killara house that backed onto national parkland, Felicity Unwin was
more than happy to find a new home on the edge of the bush.
Unwin, 71, and her husband, Dr Ross Unwin, 75, bought an apartment in Lindfield's Crimson Hill
which borders Lane Cove National Park.

"It's a lovely area and we're used to living close to the bush," says Felicity.

While Ross will take a 15-minute commute to his medical rooms in Macquarie Shopping Centre,
Felicity will use the apartment's third bedroom as her art studio.

"And we'll have the best of both worlds being right on the bush but with quick access to work and the
city."
