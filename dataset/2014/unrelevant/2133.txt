Quite likely the market will attempt one more rally high ..

Daniel Goulding in "The Sextant Market Report" today (thankyou Daniel) said "following last week's
reading to indicate the heightened possibility of a pullback in excess of 15%.. the next relevant exercise is
determining the exact timing of the top. Unless the current sell off picks up steam, it is quite likely the
market will attempt one more rally high before a meaningful decline can commence .."

Daniel still expects the ASX200 will fall towards or below 4300 late 2014/early 2015 before a long term
bull market that could begin as early as 2016.

Our market closed down 45.6 points to 5435.8, closing 18 points off the lows of the day, on average
volume worth $3.9 billion. Banks and resources were both down sharply, with no sectors in the positive.
Thwe $A is at 93.44US c, up about 55 points from last evening.
A combination of pre-Budget jitters, continuing evidence of China's slowing economy, weakness in Asian
markets and the Ukraine problem all combined to weaken sentiment.

Meanwhile, a host of excellent Aussie companies are making presentations today at the Macquarie
Conference - likely to at least slightly to have improved overall sentiment.
