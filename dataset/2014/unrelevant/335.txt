394 issues higher and 612 down. the SPI Futures closed down 28 points to 5431 on strong volume of
24,155 contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields were down 1 point to 3.84%. The $A is at 93.95 US c,
currently up about 20 points on last evening.

*The banks contributed 7.8 negative points to the index, insurers contributed 0.2 positive points, resources

negative points and Telstra contributed 1.9 negative points.

Spot gold is steady at $1261. Crude futures is up 22c to $104.62.

Our market sagged all day, losing a final 5 points on matchout. There is a lack of optimism in the market -
demand for coal and now iron ore, the two bulwarks of the resources export trade are respectively out of
favor and now in surplus with falling prices, jobs from the great old employment sources are disappearing -
eg m/v manufacture, Williamstown ship building jobs threatened with the government confirming the two
largest ships it has ordered will be built abroad, housing prices are inflated and out of reach for the young,
- and a grim budget, particularly in the midst of falling economic growth.

"Ceiling will be 5472. Floor will be 5410.. close at 5453, down 1 point"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract down 17 points.

"In terms of the bigger picture, the jury is still out on the matter of deflation versus inflation. The price
action in commodity markets, and their internal backdrops suggest the spectre of deflation could make a
return but by no means is it a fait accompli.

"At present, the Aussie Materials are positioned on the edge of a cliff, given the presence of a head and
shoulders pattern which if triggered, projects a 10% decline. "Obviously the inflation-deflation thematic has
huge implications for how portfolio managers should be positioned. Ultimately the go-to asset when
deflation raises its head are bonds, and this usually works out well.

"Arguably however, we live in exceptional times, and the last exceptional time when deflation raised its
head, bond yields went higher against expectations. What we saw back in the middle of 2013 was
arguably a deflationary tremor where bond yields went higher. Of course one might counter that it was
simply the result of pending tapering but that's what makes a market.

Page130of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5472. The floor will be 5410. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5453, down 1 point"..

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 15.7 points to 5454 last evening.

*ACCC will block Healthscope proposed purchase of Brunswick Private Hospital
The ACCC announced today it will oppose the acquisition of Healthscope's proposed purchase of a
123-bed rehabilitation hospital, Brunswick Private Hospital, from Healthe Care.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said on Thursday it will oppose the deal, on the
basis it would lessen competition for private patients requiring rehabilitation services in Melbourne's inner
north.

"The ACCC is concerned that there are no other private rehabilitation hospitals in northern Melbourne and
Healthscope would face only limited competition from the Epworth hospital in Richmond and St Vincent's
Private in East Melbourne, located in Melbourne's inner east," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a
statement.
China white paper sends shock waves through Hong Kong/barristers protest
China State Council released an unprecedented White Paper that said Hong Kong is just "one of the
local administrative regions' and warns against "outside forces' using the city to interfere in China's
domestic affairs.
"The high degree of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong is subject to the central government's
authorisation," says the paper.
*Macquarie Group has cautioned against investing in Hong Kong companies which are exposed to the
political winds of mainland China, following an official warning that the city's administrative "autonomy" is
a privilege that can be removed at any time.
Hong Kong has retained its status as the financial hub of Asia since its handover from Great Britain in
1997, when Chinese leaders committed to retain a system of "one country two systems' for 50 years.
On Tuesday, China's

The city is home to more than 80,000 Australians while 550 Australian businesses have a "major
presence" there, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but many are growing uneasy
at the growing reach of Beijing.
Our thought only: Also huge impact on the LME, if Hong Kong becomes "just a local admin region" for
China.
*The South China Morning Post reports the day after China's unprecedented white paper outlining
Beijing's "comprehensive jurisdiction" over Hong Kong the HK Bart Association said it was "erroneous' for
Beijing to place local judges in the same category as "Hong Kong's administrators', including the chief
executive and top officials.

"Any erroneous public categorisation of judges and judicial officers as 'administrators' or official
exhortation for them to carry out any political mission or task" would send out the wrong message to
Hongkongers and the international community, it said.
That sent out a message that Hong Kong courts were not independent, it said.

*UK govt, NZ jettison Tony Abbott's plan to oppose carbon emission scheme
"The Age" reports the UK's conservative climate and energy minister has rejected suggestions his
government could form an alliance of "like-minded" nations with Australia to oppose carbon pricing, putting
an end to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's dream that a group of five countries could be formed to undermine
global moves to install carbon pricing and challenge a push by US President Barack Obama for stronger
international regulation of climate change.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen are increasingly isolated in their push to
limit action to mitigate climate change.

In moves that show Australia is increasingly isolated on the subject, New Zealand's Prime Minister John
Key has also said he was caught off-guard by the idea of an alliance and signalled his government has no
intention of walking away from its emissions trading scheme. ''This government takes climate change
seriously,'' a spokeswoman said.

Page132of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*Former Vice President Al Gore said he was aware that Tony Abbott had once used a 'scatological word"
to describe the science, and said Australia had some of the best scientists, if not the best, in the world who
are fully aware of the serious consequences for Australia - also measures to counter climate change,
including retrofitting with green energy sources could create thousands of jobs. H

He added, "Mother Nature has a louder voice than Tony Abbott".

*CGS: Signs first contract for its new web based tool, Precision Recruitment

Cogstate Ltd announced it has signed its first contract for Precision Recruitment, a new web based tool for
streamlining patient recruitment for clinical drug trials. The contract will generate $US1.8 million of
revenue for Cogstate over an estimated 24 month period.

Precision Recruitment was launched last month for pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost and time
associated with recruiting patients for clinical trials.
While traditionally most patient pre trial screening has taken place on site, a slow expensive and inefficient
process, Precision Recruitment allows patients to initially be screened at home.

Analyst comment: A leading broker said while Cogstate in its presentation (on June 6) had advised a profit
downgrade and Merck pulling away from the Canadian program, "It sounds like CGS has a clear plan to
move back to break even in a short period of time.

The share price has been knocked back to a low of 24c from a six month high of 39c. The plan involves
divesting Axon Sports (reducing loss by $A1.3 million) increasing the level of clinical trials work coming
through and developing a new revenue stream in patient screening for clinical trials with a paticular
emphasis on Alzheimer's disease.
"With a market cap of $A23.7 million, $7.1 million in cash and possible sale of Axon Sports and more

Nexus Energy Ltd has asked for a trading halt pending an announcement on the results of the Scheme
Meeting to be held today at 11 a.m.

*NXS/SVW: More than 50% have vetoed the Scheme on a count of proxy votes
Nexus Energy Ltd advised following the deadline for casting direct votes and lodging of proxy
appointments by 11 a.m. on June 10, Nexus has today been advised by Computershare Investor Services
that the final audited proxy votes cast in connection with the scheme total 897.7 million, representing
67.48% of all the issued shares in Nexus. The final audited proxy votes provide that more than 50% of
Nexus shareholders who have cast a direct vote or lodged a proxy appointment have voted against the
scheme, and greater than 25% of the total number of Nexus shares on issue have voted against the
Scheme.

Unless a sufficient number of Nexus shareholders who have voted or directed their proxy to vote against
the Scheme attend the Scheme Meeting and change their vote, the statutory majorities required for the
Scheme to be approved will not be attained. Seven West Group has advised Nexus that it will not (outside
of its participation in a Nexus administration or other insolvency process) grant waivers of any repayment
obligations under the Bridge Facility and Senior Facility and will rely on its rights and entitlements as
senior secured creditor and majority noteholder.
Nor will it provide an alternate acquisition or funding proposal to Nexus.

If the Scheme is not approved, absent an alternative proposal that provides adequate and immediately
available funding, the Nexus Board would need to place Nexus into voluntary administration.
SGW has also advised Nexus that it will seek to acquire all of Nexus' shares or some or all of Nexus'
assets through a Nexus administration or other insolvency process.

Nexus confirms no competing or superior offers have been received to date. (Jun 11)
