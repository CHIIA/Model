12:56 EDT - Asian fund managers predominantly in the buyout, growth, venture capital and secondary
sectors raised $15.31B in 3Q, pushing the total amount raised for the first nine months to on par with the
whole of 2013, according to data from Dow Jones LP Source. In total, fund managers raised $46.46B as
of 3Q, already equal to the amount raised for all of 2013. Asia's regional megafunds have dominated
fundraising as cautious investors allocate large sums of capital into top-performing managers with a
history of distributions. Carlyle Group (CG) closed a $3.9B Asian buyout vehicle in September, and
Morgan Stanley's (MS) Asian private-equity arm in July raised $1.7B for a fourth fund to invest across
the region. (sonja.cheung@wsj.com; @SonjaCheung)

12:47 EDT - Novelis, a unit of India's Hindalco Industries, says it's officially opened the first plant in
China "dedicated to the production of heat-treated aluminum automotive sheet." As governments exact
higher fuel efficiency standards from automakers, aluminum's market share in the automotive industry is
growing fast. Since 2011, Novelis, which operates in 11 countries, has invested over $550M to triple its
automotive sheet capacity to 900,000 metric tons by 2015. The new facility in Changzhou has an annual
capacity of 120,000 tons a year and will deliver "high-quality automotive sheet for use in lightweight
vehicle structures and body panels such as hoods, doors, fenders and lift gates" to customers in Asia.

12:39 EDT - Falling nearly 20% within a month, Illumina (ILMN) completes the reversal of the downdraft
in the wake of the gene-sequencing company's 3Q beat-and-raise. Janney upgrades ILMN to buy and
hikes its fair-value estimate to $192 from $165 as the company has expanded its "core customer base
from traditional academic and government institutions into clinical and applied markets...This reality
expands the company's moat, improves long-term growth visibility and extends ILMN's ability to
maintain industry-leading growth rates." While Cantor Fitzgerald says 3Q was "another blowout quarter,"
the investment bank is "less certain about capacity utilization and sustainability of the customer base
over time." It also points out how year-over-year comps will toughen in 2015. ILMN climbs 8.8% to $179,
putting the year's pop at 62%. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

12:28 EDT - The period of unusually low volatility that began a couple of years ago has finally come to an
end, says BlackRock's Russ Koesterich. But while investor sentiment has clearly shifted, economic
fundamentals remain relatively stable. "This suggests the recent sell-off in stocks could present
opportunities for long-term investors," he says. BlackRock favor large- and mega-cap stocks which have
held better in the last few weeks, providing a bit of cushion from the volatility. "With the recent sell-off
having made them more attractively valued, we suggest investors continue to emphasize larger
capitalizations, particularly with more volatility likely on the horizon." (chiara.albanese@wsj.com

12:25 EDT - The past week's 15% rebound in Ocwen (OCN) shares is getting washed away as New
York's top banking regulator accuses the mortgage servicer of backdating correspondence with
borrowers in financial straits, a move which could have allowed OCN to avoid making mortgage
modifications. The company has been under more than its share of regulatory scrutiny of late--which
has led to shares hitting a series of fresh 2-year lows. Another one has occurred in the wake of the latest
headlines, with OCN down 12% at $23.13. It's swooned 58% this year. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com;

Middle East since the global financial crisis rocked major hubs like Dubai, and since the Arab Spring
swept through the region. Fundraising and investment in the region have been fairly muted since the
global financial crisis, according to data from the Emerging Markets and Private Equity Association. In
2008, a dozen and a half funds raised $3.35B for investment there. In the subsequent five years,
fundraising totals failed to exceed $800M. With their new funds, Gulf Capital and NBK have collected
$1.06B, nearly as much as the $1.14B raised through the entire Middle East and North Africa region in
2012 and 2013. (hillary.canada@wsj.com; @H_Canada)
12:18 EDT - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission fined Edison International's (EIX) utility
$650,000 as part of a settlement stemming from a probe into the utility's involvement in a September
2011 blackout that left five million people in Arizona, southern California and Baja California, Mexico in
the dark. EIX's plans for separating its system from a major transmission line in the event of a problem
were inadequate, the regulator found. FERC earlier this year fined the Imperial Irrigation District $12M
and Pinnacle West's (PNW) Arizona utility agreed to pay $3.25M as part of settlements with FERC to
resolve a federal investigation into the utilities' roles in the blackout. EIX flat at $59.82.

12:09 EDT - The Fed bought $1.536B in Treasurys today as part of its monthly bond-buying stimulus
program, which is expected to end this month. If it does, that leaves two more daily operations: one this
Thursday targeting $1.36B-$1.65B and the last one on Monday targeting $0.85B-$1.05B in long-dated
bonds. While it's been a long time coming, Nomura still thinks financial markets will undergo a "reset
process" when active QE is officially over, which likely means higher volatility. "The Fed would love to
transition away from being the driver of markets to a strong economy justifying valuations...however we
think fundamentals won't fill QE shoes the same way." DJIA up 164, 10-yr yielding just under 2.21%.

11:55 EDT - Google (GOOGL) is rolling out new changes to its all-important search algorithm to demote
sites which feature pirated content, but some copyright owners still wonder why the company isn't doing
more. For instance, in some searches with the keyword "mp3" appended to the name of an artist or
song, sites like mp3skull.com can appear first. GOOGL's transparency report shows it has received more
than 3M requests from copyright owners to take down web pages from mp3skull, but data from analytics
site Alexa show GOOGL is still a top source driving traffic there. Even so, the overall percentage of traffic
to mp3skull.com coming from search engines has already dropped significantly the past few months,
according to Alexa, from nearly 50% over the summer to closer to 30% recently. (rolfe.winkler@wsj.com;

11:55 EDT - Brazil's presidential race is still a statistical tie, but polls, analysts and investors say the
momentum belongs to President Dilma Rousseff. Brazil's Ibovespa stock index is down almost 2.6% in
afternoon trading. The incumbent has been stumping hard in big cities in the nation's southeast, picking
off voters in the stronghold of challenger Aecio Neves, according to the latest Datafolha poll. And thanks
to her campaign's effective attack ads, Neves' rejection rate (40% of voters) is higher than Rousseff's
(39%) for the first time in the campaign. Rousseff's "chances of re-election are higher than they were two
weeks ago," says economist Pedro Paulo Silveira of financial services firm TOV Corretora.

11:55 EDT - Hedge funds were recently caught "wrong-footed in several markets at the same time," says
Societe Generale. No surprise there, as WSJ reported as much today. But SocGen provides more color
for the pain, spelling out their aggregate positions by asset class. As of Oct. 14, hedge funds were bullish
on oil, and stocks in the US, Japan and emerging markets. They were bearish on small-cap US stocks,
volatility and Treasurys. They had to unwind some of those trades during the declines, meaning "their
performance will not benefit when markets turn around," SocGen says. (alexandra.scaggs@wsj.com;

11:47 EDT - Coke's (KO) disappointing 3Q results and downbeat outlook prompt the stock to suffer its
worst performance in 6 years. Among those taking a hit is Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)
has long been the soda company's largest shareholder, and today's 6% stock drop means BRKB's
400M-share, or 9%, stake is worth $1B less than at Monday's close. It's the second day in a row a major
BKRB holding has taken a hit, with IBM skidding 7.1% yesterday after its own 3Q report. It's off another
3.3% Tuesday as the broader market continues to rebound. The duo is pulling 55 points from the Dow
industrials, which nonetheless is up 164. After being flat yesterday, BRKB is up 1.1
today.(steven.russolillo@wsj.com; @srussolillo)
