Moody's Investors Service says that the 1H 2014 results of CLP Holdings Limited (CLPH) are in line with
expectations and have no immediate impact on its A2 issuer rating.

The rating outlook remains negative.

"CLPH's Hong Kong operations continued to generate stable cash flow, while its overseas operations
showed a modest turnaround attributed to cost reductions in Australia and improved coal supply in India,"
says Ivy Poon, a Moody's Analyst. "However, the Australia operations remain under pressure due to the
challenging operating environment."
CLPH reported a drop of 9% in total revenue to HKD47.1 billion, mainly due to the lower top-line
contribution from its Australia operations.
Nevertheless, its operating earnings, excluding non-recurring gains, rose 22% to HKD4.8 billion,
supported by the stronger earnings from the Hong Kong operations -- after the full integration with
Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) and Hong Kong Pumped Storage Development
Company, Limited (PSDC) -- and higher returns from its ongoing investments in electricity infrastructure.
Furthermore, the Australia operations reported improved earnings, driven by the improving cost structure
since 2H 2013. However, the operations will remain under stress in the next 12 months due to sluggish
demand, falling margins, and the removal of the country's carbon tax and associated transitional
assistance.
The overall performance of the India operations showed some improvements; for example, the coal
shortages at the Jhajjar plant were resolved. However, the improved performance at Jhajjar will continue
to be partially offset by reduced earnings from the Paguthan plant due to weak demand from the offtaker.
"In addition, the company's leverage increased along with its total debt after CAPCO/PSDC acquisitions,
but we expect the weakening in the credit metrics to be temporary, given the debt repayments scheduled
in 2H 2014," says Poon.
Reported total debt rose to HKD75 billion from HKD56 billion in 2013, mainly because of the full
consolidation of CAPCO.

Correspondingly, adjusted debt/ capitalization, including Moody's adjustments on the perpetual securities,
increased to 47% from 42.5% at end-2013 and adjusted funds from operation (FFO) / debt fell to around
23% from 27.8% at end-2013.
However, CLPH has maintained higher-than-expected cash of HKD6.8 billion in view of the Group's debt
repayments scheduled in 2H 2014. As a result, Moody's expects adjusted debt/capitalization will recover
to below 45% and adjusted FFO/debt will hover at similar levels at end-2014.
The negative rating outlook continues, given the uncertainties related to its overseas operations, and
especially the persistent pressure expected for its Australian operations over the next 12 months.

The principal methodology used in this rating was Regulated Electric and Gas Utilities published in
December 2013. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
