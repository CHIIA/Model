THE value of Chinese deals in Australia has surged since the start of the year with Sino investors
continuing to move on mining projects.
The value of merger and acquisition activity carried out by Chinese investors surged 42 per cent to
$2.4 billion in the first six months of the year compared to the same period a year earlier, a report by
accounting firm PwC found.

The resources sector accounted for 88 per cent of the total value of the deals, dominated by Chinese
investors moving to increase existing shareholdings in miners. “The fact these deals are strategic
moves by existing shareholders, combined with easing commodity prices and a persistently high
Australian dollar, argues against calling any general turnaround in Chinese interest in resource sector
investment,” PwC’s Deals Asia leader Andrew Parker said.Guangdong Rising Assets Management’s
proposed takeover of Brisbane-based Laos copper and gold producer PanAust and Baosteel taking
control of iron ore and coal miner Aquila Resources accounted for the bulk of Chinese merger and
acquisition activity.
