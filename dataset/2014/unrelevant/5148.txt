14:42 EDT - Simon Properties (SPG) is happy with its size globally, CEO David Simon said during the
company's 3Q conference call. International represents about 10% of SPG's activities, and when asked
if that could ultimately grow to 30% or 40%, he said not likely. The retail-real-estate world has been
abuzz about SPG since July, when French retailer Klepierre (LI.FR)--in which SPG owns a large
stake--expanded in Europe by agreeing to buy Dutch rival Corio (CORE.AE). Talk got even hotter last
month when an Australian newspaper reported SPG was in talks to buy retail landlord CFS (CFX.AU) for
$6B. Simon rejected those rumors at a conference later that month, saying his company--America's
largest mall operator--had "no deal" in Australia, and he didn't respond to a question mentioning Australia
today. (robbie.whelan@wsj.com; @RWhelanWSJ)

14:37 EDT - Railroad stocks dip after a series of CEO comments dimmed hope for imminent M&A deals.
Norfolk Southern (NSC) CEO Wick Moorman said on an earnings call that railroad mergers would be
"highly problematic," citing regulatory scrutiny and few cost savings to be found. His remarks follow
comments from Canadian Pacific (CP) CEO Hunter Harrison, who said yesterday he saw merit in
consolidation, but CP was unlikely to go hostile after failing to engage CSX in merger talks earlier this
month. Some analysts had speculated CP might turn its sights to NSC or Kansas City Southern (KSU),
whose eastern US networks complement CP's oil-bearing rails in the West. NSC down 2.4%; KSU down
2%; CSX off 0.6%. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com)

14:35 EDT - Subprime lender World Acceptance (WRLD) is at a 2-year low following its F2Q report, in
which EPS rose less than analysts anticipated amid what Jefferies calls "lower-than-forecast loan
volumes/growth." In the US it dropped 10% as existing-customer volume slid 17% while for new clients
lending volume was just 1.6% lower. The results come as the CFPB earlier this year requested WRLD
documents related to the "marketing, offering or extension of credit." Shares are down 25% this year,
including today's 3.2% drop to $65.44. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

14:29 EDT - India's Sesa Sterlite Ltd. (500295.BY) said today that it's paid $82.75M to Asarco stemming
from its failed attempt to acquire a US-based copper miner. Sesa, a unit of natural resources giant
Vedanta Resources (VED.LN), had sought to delay making the payment while it was appealing the
$132.75M bankruptcy judgment. Sterlite, before its merger with Sesa Goa, had offered to buy Asarco out
of bankruptcy in 2008, but the deal wasn't completed. Instead, Asarco exited bankruptcy under the
control of Mexican mining company Grupo Mexico. Asarco claimed damages from the failed Sterlite
deal, spawning years of litigation. The company had already collected $50M from Sesa Sterlite.

14:09 EDT - Chinese private-equity firm CDH Investments will return capital to its investors after
entering into a share-backed financing in the form of a loan based on some shares it owns in Chinese
pork producer WH Group. The structured transaction involves CDH "mortgaging" a portion of its WH
Groupstake in exchange for loans; it won't involve the sale of any shares. Roughly $500M in cash will be
returned to investors, and is part of CDH's drive to distribute about $1B a year to investors, says CDH
Executive Director Niklas Schelander. Chinese P-E firms have come under scrutiny for being slow to
return capital to investors, so CDH's effort to give investors back some cash will likely be well received.

14:07 EDT - Tekmira (TKMR) rebounds some today after disclosing it has started limited production of a
drug targeting a specific variant of the Ebola virus known as Ebola-Guinea, which is responsible for the

Page245of290©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.current outbreak in West Africa. TKMR expects supply availability in early December "for potential use by
various collaborators." The drug could be used in clinical trials in West Africa, but the plan hasn't been
finalized. Meanwhile, TKMR will continue to make its original experimental Ebola drug, TKM-Ebola,
available for emergency use to people with confirmed or suspected Ebola infection. TKMR has a limited
supply of the drug. Shares are up 6.8% to $19.20, cutting the week's pullback to
12%.(peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

14:04 EDT - Recent FTC actions reflect a crackdown on companies which prey on customers using
mobile technology, and the agency today announces a group of defendants has agreed to pay $10M to
settle charges they sent millions of texts to lure consumers into handing over personal information or
signing up for unwanted services. The agency has accused a number of companies and 2 of the 4
national wireless carriers of cramming, or imposing unwanted charges for third-party charges on their
cellphone bills. AT&T (T) earlier this month agreed to pay $105M to settle allegations. Wednesday's
announcement involves 3 groups of defendants, with 1 having to pay $7.8M to resolve allegations it sent
millions of texts and facilitated the sending of illegal robocalls. (gautham.nagesh@wsj.com)
14:02 EDT - Lower stocks so far this session have failed to give a boost to haven bonds. The reason:
the bond market is under pressure as banks and investors sell Treasurys to make room for new supply
from Verizon's $6.5B new bond supply, traders say. Typically a company sells Treasurys to hedge
unwanted volatility in rates when issuing new debt. When the new bonds are priced later today, the
hedge will get reversed with the firm coming back to buy Treasurys. Ten-year notes last down 8/32,
yielding 2.236%. (min.zeng@wsj.com; @minzengwsj)

14:02 EDT - Trinity Industries (TRN) could face liquidity pressures following federal jury's ruling that the
guardrail maker defrauded the U.S. government, according to Fitch. On Monday a jury said TRN should
pay $175M for lying to federal regulators when the Dallas-based company changed a guardrail's design
system. Damages are tripled---in Trinity's case, the amount would grow to $525M---under the federal
rules designed to create steep fines for companies that lie to the government. Fitch says a reasonable
worst case scenario is $1B penalty. If TRN faces a penalty of more than $500M, Fitch believes the
company's credit profile would deteriorate below investment grade. Trinity, which has denied
wrongdoing, is expected to appeal. (patrick.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @patfitzgerald23)

14:01 EDT - Goldman Sachs economists are the latest to add to a recent slew of research suggesting
the US economic recovery should be fairly insulated from weaker global growth. Goldman estimates that
a 0.5 percentage point reduction in foreign GDP should shave about 0.13 point off US GDP growth. That
means the firm's 0.3 point cut to global GDP forecasts since July should translate into a less than 0.1
point reduction in US growth in 2015 through the end of 2016. While a stronger US dollar will add to the
drag, that should be offset by lower oil prices and bond yields, GS says. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com;

13:54 EDT - Boeing (BA) is taking the 747 under its own wing, just as many airlines drop the jumbo in
favor of two-engine alternatives. The company's customer finance exposure to 747 jets it owns and
rents to airlines jumped to $461M at the end of 3Q, compared with $172M in the prior quarter and $286M
at the start of the year, according to a regulatory filing. These are all discontinued models, not the
revamped 747-8 whose sluggish sales have fueled speculation BA may cut or even cease production.
It's exposure to other aircraft types fell during the quarter, except for a small increase in the MD-90
portfolio. BA off 4.2% at $121.81. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

13:52 EDT - Janney says investors continue to be best served "waiting for evidence of a recovery as
opposed to trying to anticipate improvement" at Lumber Liquidators (LL), which posted
weaker-than-feared 3Q results. "It remains unclear how much of LL's problems are macro vs.
self-inflicted" and "when either issue will be resolved--hence a continued risk to estimates--while
valuation remains elevated." The closeout-flooring retailer "surprised us" with the magnitude of its soft
4Q view, says Janney. But Wedbush, which entered the LL bull camp last month while admitting the
move might be early, says today that "our favorable view on 2015 remains as LL puts operational issues
behind and the growth story gets back on track." LL falls 11% to $51.36, hitting a 22-month low.
