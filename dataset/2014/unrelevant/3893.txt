The big hedge funds in Singapore and Hong Kong that keep our market liquid are reeling. They had
a shocking October and have been scorched on Australian M&A deals all year.

But if there is one deal they would be willing to back, it would be Recall and its long-running suitor,
Iron Mountain.

Event funds studying the numbers reckon a tie-up with the Boston-based and United States-listed
Iron Mountain would make dollars – and sense – for both companies.
And now that Recall is positioning itself in line with Iron Mountain and considering spinning off its
property, the numbers look better.

The problem is that they cannot necessarily see it coming before the end of the year. And despite
very specific reports that Iron Mountain is working up a $2 billion-plus offer, there is one burning
question in hedgies' minds: if Iron Mountain really wants to own Recall, why didn't it make a
compelling offer before the documents business was spun out of Brambles last year? 

Still, where there is smoke there is fire, and if there is no movement before the end of the year it will
be on M&A watchlists for 2015.

Elsewhere, Orica shareholders are awaiting an update on the proposed chemicals spinoff. As Street
Talk first reported on Friday, Blackstone Group was understood to have edged ahead in the race to
buy the $1 billion entity, emerging as the leading contender after a trade sale process.
However, the global private equity giant is up against the equity markets, which are bubbling along
and could guarantee Orica's chemicals a good start to life on their own.
Finally, private equity firmPacific Equity Partners finalised the sale of biscuit maker Griffin's Foods
to Universal Robina Corp on Friday.
