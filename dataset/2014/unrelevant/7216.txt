ConocoPhillips, one of the early entrants in Australia's fledgling shale gas sector, has thrown in the towel
after disappointing drilling results, confirming that the country's shale prospects may be harder to tap than
initially thought.
"[Conoco] is seeking to transfer its interest in the Southern Canning Basin to New Standard Energy. ...
The decision to withdraw was reached following review of results from the initial drilling in context of our
overall global portfolio," Conoco's vice president for exploration and development, Frank Krieger, told
International Oil Daily.

Conoco entered the play in 2011 with domestic minnow New Standard Energy. Under the deal, Conoco
was obliged to spend $109.5 million to explore the Goldwyer shale gas prospect and, in return, received
a 75% working interest with an option to take over as operator.

Conoco brought in state PetroChina as a partner in early 2013 as part of a series of gas agreements that
saw the Chinese company take a 29% stake in the 11 million gross-acre Goldwyer shale permit.
PetroChina has also withdrawn from the permit, New Standard Energy said in a statement, and the
Australian independent is now looking to farm out some of its acreage.
