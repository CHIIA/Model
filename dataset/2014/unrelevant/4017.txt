The S&P/ASX200 closed up 44.1 points to 5338.1 on strong volume worth $5.6 billion. There were 541
issues higher and 439 down. The SPI Futures closed up 31 points to 5328 on lightish volume of 20,948
contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields were steady at 4.12%. The $A is at 90.62US c, up about 35 points
from last evening.

The banks contributed 13.2 positive points on the index, insurers contributed 2.9 points, resources
contributed 7.1 positive points, retailers contributed 2.7 positive points and Telstra contributed 0.5 positive
points.

*Over the week the S&PASX200 points was up 8.7 points or 0.2% to 5338.1.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures rose 170 points to 14,300 points, Shanghai CSI physical rose 15.81
point to 2009.29, Hang Seng futures gained 34 points to 21,184 points. S&P future was down 0.3 points to
1865.8, Nasdaq futures rose 0.75 points to 3692.25. Dow futures fell 1 point to 16,264 points.
Spot gold rose $5 to $1332. Crude was down 42c to $98.48.

*The S&P/ASX200 in a late rise climbed to 5338.1 points, up 44.1 points on last evening, doubling its early
rise with gains across the board, but the main feature was volume.
Just $1.2 billion worth of shares had traded at 12.30 pm today and 20 minutes before the close the
volume was a miserable $2.6 billion - swelling to $5.6 billion on matchout!
The buying, likely to have including one or more "buy" portfolios seems to have had a major focussed on
the financials (more detail in the 4.30 pm "hot").

ADD: Ben Faulkner added after the close, "If Shanghai holds here then the break yesterday is potentially a
false breakdown ".

"For the day I'll call us up 10 points'.

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "I'll start with the S&P500. Again there was good support
around the 1855 level last night, which held. The S&P also tested the 20 day moving average which held.
It has closed above that level for 3 days in a row in a similar range with quite big volatility. This has often
been a catalyst for a pullback, worth keeping an eye on. Meanwhile the S&P tested 1874 for the last three
nights as a resistance point. The break and close above there on the week is short term bullish. A failure
to close above it tonight could see some short term bearish pressure - keep an eye on the close for the
week.
*Copper was down 5% last night, very close to the $2.90/lb support level. We really need to see $2.90
hold for the week. If not it is very bearish for copper. On the 5 year weekly chart copper has been in
downtrend since back in 2011. Keep an eye on the $2.90/lb price on Comex. A break would look quite
ugly.

Page192of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*Shanghai had quite a volatile day. It broke and closed below the key 2000 level we have talked about,
that it has tested several times in the last couple of weeks. The break and close below 2000 was pretty
bearish. A break and close below 2000 today would confirm the bearish trend after being short term
bearish yesterday.

*The XJO had a lot of selling pressure yesterday, probably indicating some overseas selling, and pretty
much closed on its lows. Given we broke levels of support yesterday, on the daily chart there is probably
no real support now until 5260. A break of 5260 would threaten a head back towards 5190.

"For the week, the bulls will want to see the close at or above 5315 today. Resistance is at 5300 and then
5315. Anywhere above 5315 and we're looking for 5330 for the next resistance.

"For the day I'll call us up about 10 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 61.6 points to 5294 last evening.

Gina Rinehart secures $US7.2 billion in funding for Roy Hill

agencies provide $US7.2 billion ($7.9 billion) to support the 55 million tonne project, which aims to ship

Total capex is estimated to peak at between $150/180 million in 2015, reducing to $130/150 million in
