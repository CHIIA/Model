TD

MILWAUKEE, WI--(Marketwired - May 15, 2014) - ZBB Energy Corporation (NYSE MKT: ZBB), a leading
developer of intelligent, renewable energy power platforms and hybrid vehicle control systems, today
announced its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014.

Third Quarter Highlights
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Company's major accomplishments included:

-- Completed a secondary offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at

$2.25 per share for net cash proceeds of $13.1

million.

-- Achieved the initial milestone of the joint development agreement with

Lotte Chemical, and received $3 million in one-time upfront license fees
for the quarter.

-- Tested and shipped equipment to Ergon Energy in Australia. Ergon has

successfully completed their lab testing and will place the equipment in
the field over the coming weeks as part of their field trial to
suitability.

determine

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Company:

-- Hired a sales manager for the state of Hawaii.
-- Advanced to the RFQ stage for the

Imperial Irrigation District's

40-megawatt energy storage project.

"The completion of our secondary offering and the initiation of the Lotte Chemical project strengthened
our balance sheet this quarter and enhanced our financial capacity to more aggressively pursue the
multiple sales opportunities in our markets," said Eric C. Apfelbach, President and Chief Executive Officer.
"To prepare for these opportunities, we are actively working to add staff in our sales and technical areas,
including our recent hire of a sales manager for Hawaii."
"Additionally, ZBB and Lotte are working towards an agreement that would enable Lotte to purchase from
ZBB the "chassis" frame, internal componentry and power electronics for ZBB EnerStore(R) flow
batteries, whereby Lotte will source the electrolyte and manufacture the stacks to be placed in the chassis

Page128of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.frame provided by ZBB. This combined global manufacturing strategy will give us the lowest possible
costs and enable us to ramp quickly to meet the large demand that is being indicated by the RFQ activity."
"We believe our products are the right fit for the multi-billion dollar energy storage proposals in
California, New York, Province of Ontario and South Korea." continued Mr. Apfelbach. "We expect
additional energy storage proposals going forward, including in China, which we believe over time has
the potential to be a $40 billion market opportunity."

Financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2013 included:

-- Product sales decreased 59% to $822,318 from $2,019,191.
-- Engineering and development revenues increased 650% to $750,000 from

$100,000.

-- License revenues were $3,000,000.
-- Product gross margin was 33.0% compared to 12.8% in the prior year

quarter.

-- Net loss to common stockholders improved to $67,945 compared to

$2,824,313.

-- Loss per share improved to ($0.00) from ($0.18).

Financial results for the nine month period ending March 31, 2014 compared to the nine months ended
March 31, 2013:

-- Product sales decreased 58% to $2,652,896 from $6,372,336.
-- Engineering and development revenues increased 200% to $950,000 from

$318,183.

-- Product gross margin was 36.0% compared to 13.4% in the prior year

period.

-- Net loss to common stockholders improved to $4,901,204 compared to

$8,790,560.

-- Loss per share improved to ($0.27) from ($0.57).

Financial Position
The Company's backlog as of March 31, 2014 was approximately $5.2 million. $3.25 million of our
backlog relates to provisions of the Lotte Amended License and Research and Development Agreements.
The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2014 with total assets of $23.5 million, including $13.4
million in cash and $583,000 in accounts receivable.

"I expect our order flow to remain uneven in the near-term. We will continue to work with our partners,
including Lotte Chemical and Cummins Crosspoint, to extend our relationships and secure additional
business. In addition, the recently announced plan by the U.S. Department of Energy to offer up to $4
billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy projects could rejuvenate interest and orders in the
domestic market," Mr. Apfelbach concluded.

The Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 15, 2014 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (3:30
