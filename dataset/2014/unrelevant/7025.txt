The export deal with Seoul won't solve the lack of milk
WITH more than 60 years of experience running a dairy farm, the De Vere family knows how to
make the most of any business opportunity that comes its way.

The family's 100ha farm, River Ridge Dairies on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, is home to 160
cattle that produce a million litres of milk each year.

While third-generation farmer Ray De Vere yesterday welcomed the news that the South
Korea-Australia free-trade agreement will include the dairy industry, he said drought and low milk
prices meant he was unlikely to profit.
``Any export market is a positive for Australia, whether it be China, South Korea, Indonesia or
Singapore,'' Mr De Vere said. ``(But) the milk's just not there, Australia is short of milk. There are
more and more farmers dropping out due to bad weather, they're culling their stock or export to keep
their farms going.

``The farmers know it, the processors know it, but consumers and the government just think it's
cruising along nicely.''
As the Abbott government announced yesterday that tariffs of up to 176 per cent on dairy exports
would be phased out under the agreement, Mr De Vere said there was simply not enough money to
invest in producing milk for international markets even though demand was high.
He currently gets 54c for a litre of milk while production costs 36c. Farm repairs, administration and
other costs increase that figure by a further 17c before the De Vere family makes any money for
itself.
``We made a 1.9 per cent return on a $2 million asset last year. That's a pretty crazy business to
be involved in when most businesses strive to make a 15 per cent return,'' he said.
``The drought could be managed if the farmers were getting a higher return for their milk. They
could buy feed and invest money into their farms on water and infrastructure. But while the money
isn't there to tip back into your asset, you're just not going to be able to produce more milk.''

National Farmers Federation president Brent Finlay said the industry welcomed the decision to scrap
tariffs in the South Korea-Australia deal, but hoped to see similar outcomes from other such
agreements negotiated with countries including Japan.
According to Dairy Australia's Situation and Outlook update released this month, South Korea was
Australia's 10th-largest dairy market in 2012-13, importing 18,178 tonnes of products.
