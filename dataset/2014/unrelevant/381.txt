Australian shares rose slightly on Wednesday after a slew of positive news from miners helped to
offset another day of weakness in banking stocks in the wake of David Murray's interim report into
the financial sector.

After a short-lived early rally, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index closed up 0.1 per cent on
Wednesday to 5518.9. The broader All Ordinaries Index finished ahead 0.2 per cent at 5504.5.

Rio Tinto climbed 1.3 per cent to $63.94 on robust third-quarter results, with analysts saying that the
miner was likely to exceed its full-year iron ore production target.

Fortescue Metals was also higher, finishing up 6.3 per cent at $4.58, after it told investors it could
produce as much as 160 million tonnes in the new financial year, suggesting the capacity of its
export system is not limited to 155 million tonnes as previously thought.

Resources giant BHP Billiton, meanwhile, ended ahead 0.6 per cent at $38.25. The sector was also
buoyed by positive news from China, which reported 7.5 per cent annual GDP growth in the June
quarter, slightly ahead of consensus forecasts.
"Those companies with China exposure, such as the big resources exporters, tended to outperform,
while the domestic sectors were the main underperformers," Credit Suisse's equity strategist
Damien Boey said.
Mining junior Sirius Resources led the best-performing resources sector, surging 14.8 per cent to
close at $3.95, after reporting another promising discovery near the Fraser Range area of Western
Australia. It was by far the best-performing stock on the market.

However, not all miners enjoyed the sector rally.
Newcrest continued to submit to weakness in the gold price. Its shares closed down 1 per cent at
$10.92, while gold fell 0.7 per cent to $US1298.
The spot price for iron ore, landed in China, was up 0.1 per cent to $US98 a tonne in late trade.
Australia's biggest oil producer Woodside Petroleum edged up 0.2 per cent to $41.62 as Brent crude
oil rose 0.1 per cent to $US106.10 a barrel.
The company reports June quarter production figures on Thursday,

Financials were among the worst-performing sectors, as investor sentiment continued to be affected
by Tuesday's paper by the former Commonwealth Bank of Australia boss David Murray, in which he
called for higher capital ratios and more competition between the banks, and criticised
superannuation fund fees.

growth this year as a contributing factor to weakness in the sector. Consumer staples was the worst
performing sector.

Among financials, wealth manager Perpetual was hardest hit, with a 3 per cent fall, to $47.26.

The big four banks also slipped – some for a second day running – with Westpac Banking
Corporation off 0.5 per cent at $33.89, Commonwealth Bank of Australia down 0.2 per cent at
$81.35, National Australia Bank losing 0.1 per cent to $33.98 and Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group ending the day down 0.2 per cent at $33.15.

Macquarie Group, however, was among the day's better performers, climbing 1.8 per cent to $60.08,
as buoyancy in global capital markets began to feed through to US investment banks' quarterly
earnings.

"Macquarie has become a well-rounded investment bank and wealth management group," said Bill
Chatterton, Morgans' senior private client adviser.

"This makes them an attractive investment at the moment."
