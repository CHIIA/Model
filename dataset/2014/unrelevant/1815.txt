HK firm will take the lead role in operating the North West Rail Link in Sydney from 2019 as it
expands abroad amid a drop in property profit
MTR Corp and its consortium partners have won a A$3.7 billion (HK$26 billion) contract to deliver
and operate Sydney’s North West Rail Link, Australia’s largest public transport project, which is
worth A$8.3 billion in total.

The contract awarded to the consortium by the government of the state of New South Wales was
an “operations, trains and systems contract” and was the largest of the three delivery contracts for
the railway project, MTR and other partners of the Northwest Rapid Transit consortium said on
Tuesday.
“MTRC will invest and take the lead role in railway operations, commencing from 2019,” the firm
said in a statement. But the rail operator is not involved in other contracts including tunnelling and
viaduct building.
MTR won an HK$18.5 billion contract to run the Crossrail train line in London in July. The Sydney
rail line is 36km long, much shorter than the 118km London line.
The rail operator has been expanding into rail-related businesses outside Hong Kong as its profit
from property development at home declined. Profit from property development fell 54.6 per cent
year on year to HK$203 million in the first half of this year.
“The [Australian] federal government’s objective is to catalyse A$125 billion in new infrastructure
spending by the end of the decade,” said Marcelino Fernandez Verdes, executive chairman and
chief executive of Leighton Holdings, an Australian construction and engineering company that is
one of the five partners in the consortium.

Other partners include Australian engineering services providers John Holland Group, UGL Rail
Services and infrastructure projects investor Plenary Group. MTR is the only Hong Kong company
in the consortium.

It will operate and maintain the rapid-transit network upon completion, together with John Holland
and UGL. It is also a member of a four-way joint venture with John Holland, Leighton and UGL to
deliver the infrastructure and rail systems. Plenary Group will act as the financial sponsor and
capital manager of the consortium.
“Equity financing will come from three of [Northwest Rapid Transit’s] consortium members, MTRC,
Leighton Contractors and Plenary Group,” Plenary Group said in a statement. There will also be
equity investment from other parties such as Palisade Investment Partners.

Bank and Westpac – as well as international banks such as Standard Chartered, HSBC Holdings,
ING, Plenary Group said.

The Sydney contract is a public-private partnership covering the major parts of the design,
construction and financing of the North West Rail Link, between Rouse Hill and Chatswood, and the
operation and maintenance of the new line for 15 years.

Fares for the rail line will be set and controlled by the New South Wales government, in line with
those for the rest of Sydney.
