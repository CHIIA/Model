A one-bedroom treasure trove owned by the late Sydney chef Robert Yates that attracted thousands
of online hits has sold for $776,000, $26,000 over reserve.
The oversized, one-bedroom apartment in a converted warehouse at 204/105 Campbell Street,
Surry Hills was one of 396 Sydney auctions listed for Saturday.

Every room of the 87-square-metre apartment is adorned with Mr Yates' unique collection of
Georgian furniture, French paintings, Chinese porcelain artefacts and Chinese glass paintings.
Even the modest bathroom has hanging art and, in an ode to his profession, there are three silver
cloches mounted on the kitchen wall.

Executor of the will, John Ward, who was happy with the result, reminisced about his good friend
who was affectionately known as Madame Souffle and was a flamboyant entertainer.
"His dinner parties were legendary," Mr Ward said. "His guests dined in opulence on the finest china.
He had 700 plates and used about 200 hosting a party of just eight people; he would swear a lot
from the kitchen and plate everything individually.

"Most of his possessions will be bequeathed to individuals and others will be auctioned off. He was a
generous and private man, and went out of his way to help someone. If you had a problem, he'd call
you over and whip up something to eat at the drop of a hat; he was that sort of friend."
Auctioneer Gavin Croft sold the unit in under 10 minutes with two local owner-occupier groups going
head to head.

BresicWhitney agent Romany Brooks said the result set a new standard at the landmark Carlisle
building. "We had lots of interest online and 50 group inspections but seven buyers purchased
mid-week elsewhere," she said.
"The great photos of the art in the apartment got people's curiosity and took people into another
world. Everyone also loved the 3.4-metre ceilings, practical layout, alfresco terrace and the fact it
has parking.

"There has been no slump in winter for selling in Surry Hills; it's still one of the most popular inner
city remaining viable investments but apartments, houses or terraces, we can't get enough stock."
The apartment last sold for $490,000 in 2006, has a strata levy of $1634 a quarter and has a rental
potential of $650-700 a week. It is pet friendly and has a heated indoor pool, sauna, spa, gym and
concierge in the building.
The Lumex Property Group on Saturday launched its new Strathfield residential development,
Centric.

one- and two-bedroom apartments were snapped up by owner-occupiers and investors, with prices
ranging from $629,000 for a one-bedroom unit, to $685,000 for a one-bedroom plus study and from
$780,000 for a two-bedroom unit.
