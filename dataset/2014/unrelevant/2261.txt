CHINA'S Far East Consortium and Daniel Grollo's development company Grocon have filed plans
for separate apartment projects in Melbourne with an end value of about $1.8 billion.

The plans come as new research from Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat
shows Melbourne has the fifth-highest number of 100m-plus residential buildings under construction
in the world, with 15 apartment towers being built.

FEC on Tuesday night fronted the Melbourne City Council, seeking an adjusted permit for a project
that could have an end value of $1.5bn -- Melbourne's largest apartment development.

FEC is now planning to build 2853 apartments and two five-star hotels totalling 488 rooms in four
towers on the site that once housed the former headquarters of The Age newspaper.
Fairfax sold the sprawling Spencer Street site to ISPT for $66 million in 2007. It was onsold in 2012
to FEC for $92m.

FEC did not respond to requests for comment.
Separately, Grocon has filed plans for a high-end, 320-apartment tower on Spring Street in the CBD
overlooking Treasury Gardens. The tower will have 40 storeys.

The project, aimed at owner-occupiers, is expected to have an end value of $300m.

Newly appointed Grocon chief executive Carolyn Viney said the development would be the first for
its joint venture investment vehicle with UBS -- UBS Grocon Real Estate.
``We think it's the right time to harness growing interest in Melbourne's residential market and this
project will mark the fourth residential project we've secured in our pipeline over the past 12
months,'' she said.
Chinese-Australian group Golden Sunrise Developments is embarking on a twin-tower,
348-apartment project in Southbank following strong sales.
Golden Sunrise will build two towers -- one 37 levels, the other 34 -- on a site that abuts Kings Way
in the Melbourne CBD fringe precinct of Southbank.
Golden Sunrise purchased the site from a joint venture between Macquarie Bank and Lustig &
Moar last year. The building is expected to have an end value of more than $160m. The Marco
apartments will hold 348 apartments on the 1455sq m site that sits next to the Australian Red
Cross's former headquarters.
The former ARC site is owned by Central Equity and will be home to its 419-dwelling Epic
apartment project, which has an end value in excess of $200m.

development in the CBD after planning issues. Sixth Grange, affiliated with Singaporean developer
Harry Chua, will retain the permit for a 61-storey tower.
