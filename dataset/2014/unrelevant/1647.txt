The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close higher today.

Markets in Europe, the UK and US closed higher.

On the NYSE where 3226 issues traded there were 1,622 issues higher, 1,494 down and 110 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2718 issues traded there were 984 issues higher, 1,646 down and 88 unchanged.
Metals were mostly weaker, crude was mixed, gold fell. The $A is at 92.60US c, down about 15 points
from last evening.

"Maree" said, "It looks today as if we will have a gain on the market.

"There has been a lot of focus on Australia's (lower) growth. We have not made new highs like the rest of
the world, we have factored in a lot of this slowdown. We have factored in China's slowing. A lot of the
negatives from the forthcoming Budget have also been factored in - we expect it will be in deficit, may be
another 5/10 years.

"While the $A is too high for manufacturing exporters and others, the Aussie dollar at current levels keeps
inflation restrained. If the $A was weak the RBA would probably be forced to lift interest rates - and we
know the level of debt for households is alarmingly high. I don't think a weaker $A would get us out of
trouble.

"Meanwhile, we have the 4th largest level of funds under management in the world.

"For today, I expect the market will rise about 20 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed at 5536.1, up 5.1 points last evening.

April 29. Good morning.

*The US imposed further sanctions on seven Russian officials and 17 firms linked to President Putin's
"inner circle" over their role in the Ukraine crisis. The EU added 15 names to the list of persons sanctioned
for "actions undermining the Ukraine's territorial integrity, a EU spokeswoman said in a Twitter post.

*IMF yesterday downgraded Australia's growth f'cast - too low to stop unemployment rising. Missed by us
yesterday, deepest apologies.

reading since May 2013, and the most since 2011.

The increase beat economists' expectations for a 1% advance and was the first increase after eight
consecutive months.

These contracts usually become sales after a month or two, and March's rise suggested home resales
could rebound in the months ahead.

*The US Treasury Department announced the biggest quarterly paydown of government debt in seven

end of June cash balance of $130 billion, the Treasury reported in Washington.
However net borrowing of 4169 billion is projected for the next quarter, with $130 billion in cash on
September 30.

*In Germany the Bundesbank in its monthly report issued last night said it expects the German economy
to lose momentum in the second quarter after a strong start to the year. The bank cited the surge in
industrial orders as reason for strong growth in the first quarter with mild weather also underpinning
growth.

*In the UK, the outlook for the economy over the next three months is "exceptionally strong and broad
based" according to the employers' organisation the CBI, BBC News reported.

In other news

*The IMF last evening downgraded its growth forecast for Australia since its report on October 2013 to
growth of 2.6 % in 2014 and 2.7 % in 2015. The Washington-based institution has previously expected
Australia's economy to grow between 2.8% and 2.9 %.
The IMF said Australia's economy is expected to grow below the trend since investments in the mining
boom have reached its peak and is now on a declining phase. In the agency's regional report, Regional
Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific released in HongKong on April 28, the IMF also said Australia's
economy will need to grow above 3 % every year to keep unemployment rates from rising further.

Australia's Treasurer Joe Hockey has previously pledged that his budget on May 13 will not block the
country's tentative signs of economic recovery. He suggested that budget cuts might happen in the
coming years as part of a 10-year plan.

*The IMF upgraded its economic growth forecasts for New Zealand in the last six months. The agency
expects the New Zealand economy to grow at 3.3 % in 2014 and 3% in 2015. The previous growth
forecast was at 2.4 %.
*Asia is expected to experience strong growth in 2014 and 2015 to be among the company of global
growth leaders. The Asian region is expected to benefit from improved growth opportunities among the
world's advanced economies.

However, global economies continue to face new and old risks including the ongoing geopolitical
uncertainty over Ukraine, the tapering or the moving away from the unconventional monetary U.S. policy
and the impact of low inflation in the EU, the report said.
