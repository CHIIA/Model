CHINESE tourists visiting Australia have an eye on migrating, with many attracted by our education
system and cleaner environment.
A report says interest from China was confirmed by evidence Chinese people were snapping up
Australian apartments.

“Chinese buyers look to buy in areas where there is an existing Chinese community and are often
buying for their children while they study, ensuring that they buy close to transport networks,”
Chinese Tourists — Exploring New Frontiers says.
With the number of Chinese tourists to all foreign destinations tipped to double to 200 million a year
by 2020, the report by Asian investment firm CLSA says Australia could reap its share with
potentially huge spending on retail, wine and casinos.
“Reportedly, more of Penfolds’ flagship product Grange is sold from the Sydney international
terminal than any other Australian store,” it says.The report says China has become Australia’s
second-biggest inbound visitor market, with Chinese visitors spending $3.5 billion here in the 12
months to September.
