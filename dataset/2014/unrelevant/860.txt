Japanese stocks rose Wednesday as a stronger dollar and hopes for a clearer picture of U.S.
monetary policy helped exporters and financial shares lead the market higher.

The Nikkei Stock Average rose for a second consecutive day, and closed up 0.9% at 15115.80.

The dollar rose 0.3% overnight to cross the 102 yen mark, and advanced further in Asian trade -- last
at 102.22 yen, compared with 102.16 yen late Tuesday in New York.

Exporters benefited from the weaker yen. Panasonic gained 3.4%, TDK added 2.4% and Suzuki Motor
climbed 2.3%.

Tokyo was also supported by a rise in market heavyweight SoftBank, which added 1.7% as the
company bounced back after two days of losses.
In addition, Resona Holdings rose by 2.8% after Deutsche Bank reiterated its "buy" recommendation,
citing progress in the bank's plan to pay back government bailout funds received over the past few
years.

More broadly, Asian markets were mixed as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the Federal
Reserve's statement, waiting for an update on the direction of monetary policy in the world's largest
economy. The U.S. central bank was expected to announce another $10 billion reduction in its
bond-buying program to $35 billion a month.
In Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index ended down 0.1% at 23181.72, Chinese property
developers fell after signs of further weakness in China's housing market. Average new home prices
rose 5.4% from a year earlier in May, compared with a 6.4% gain in April.
China Resources Land fell 1.2% in Hong Kong and Evergrande Real Estate Group fell 16%.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5% to 2055.52. China Vanke, the world's largest residential
property developer by revenue, fell 0.3%, and Poly Real Estate Group slipped 0.2%.

In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3% to 5382.70, its lowest close in more than two months, as
resource companies remained in focus.
Woodside Petroleum fell 4.6% in Sydney after the oil company resumed trading following Royal
Dutch Shell's sale of a 9.5% stake in the firm to institutional investors. That move weighed on the
broader market on Tuesday, as investors sold shares in other companies to take part in the deal.
Also in Sydney, energy-minerals firmAquila Resources surged 7% after the company recommended
to shareholders that it accept a takeover deal from China's Baosteel Group and Aurizon Holdings.

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi was down 0.6% to 1989.49, its lowest close in more than five
weeks.

at 25246.25.
