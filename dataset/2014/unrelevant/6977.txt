Perth, Australia (Platts)--9Apr2014/449 am EDT/849 GMT
Thailand's state-controlled upstream company PTTEP wants to prioritize the development of the
Cash-Maple gas and condensates fields offshore northwestern Australia, which will likely mean selling
all or part of its Montara oil field, also in the Timor Sea, a senior PTTEP executive said Wednesday.

"We're looking for partners for Cash-Maple and looking for anyone who would give value for Montara,"
Montri Rawanchaikul, PTTEP's deputy CEO for exploration and development said at the final session of
the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association's annual conference in Perth, Western
Australia.

"We need to re-arrange our portfolio...we see the value in Montara, with production ramping up and the
project has been de-risked. Part of our strategy is to rearrange it, it's not essential that we pull out," he
said.

The Cash-Maple fields contain an estimated 2-3 trillion cubic feet of gas, plus condensates.
The PTTEP executive said that, as a stranded offshore asset, the company was looking at both floating
LNG and pipeline options for developing Cash-Maple.

"Geographically it's great because we can take the gas back to Thailand," said Rawanchaikul.

He added that that PTTEP would like to conclude work on a development option this year, so the
company can take a final investment decision on Cash-Maple in 2016 and produce first gas in 2022.
In September 2013, PTTEP-Australasia CEO Ken Fitzpatrick said the company was hoping to reach
FID on Cash-Maple in 2015-2016 and was targeting first gas for export by end-2019 or early 2020.

Last month the Australian newspaper reported PTTEP was seeking to sell its assets offshore Western
Australia, including both Montara and Cash-Maple.
The newspaper said Montara has been valued at $2 billion by consulting company McKinsey and
named ConocoPhillips, Woodside, Apache, Italy's Eni and China's state owned Sinopec and PetroChina,
as possible buyers.
Montara, which started producing oil in late June last year, is currently pumping some 20,000 b/d,
Rawanchaikul said. All the oil is sold to the company's parent PTT, he added.
Montara had originally been scheduled to start up in late 2009, but a 10-week oil spill and subsequent
fire at the drilling rig led to the development being suspended while investigations were carried out.
PTTEP's drilling license for the field was renewed in February 2011.
