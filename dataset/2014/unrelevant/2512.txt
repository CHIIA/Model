By 2030, two-thirds of the global middle class will be in the Asia-Pacific region which opens up enormous
opportunity for regional air travel

By 2030, two-thirds of the global middle class will be in the Asia-Pacific region which opens up enormous
opportunity for regional air travel

Asia-Pacific is A high-growth region. Ernst & Young has reported in a survey that this region will have 1.7
billion people who qualify as middle class by 2020 and that this figure is expected to touch 3.2 billion by
2030. That means the region will have two-thirds of the global middle class. It also means that the air
travel potential of the growing middle class is enormous.

Another interesting fact that is music to the ears of airlines is that there is large-scale migration from
smaller cities to larger cities. The air connectivity for such traffic movement has to be regional and hence
some of the Asian countries have begun networking the hinterland with smaller airports. Those who have
taken an early lead are likely to emerge winners. The key regional airline players in Asia-Pacific are few,
but the landscape is soon going to change as there are a number of them entering the fray. Australia
which has a fairly large geographical spread, has fairly networked different locations with competitive
regional airlines.

Air Costa , Indian Regional Saga
Air Costa , an Indian regional airline based in Vijayawada, commenced operations in October 2013 with
two Embraer E-170 aircraft leased from ECC.

The airline plans to focus on improving connectivity between Tier-II and Tier-III cities in India and has
announced an investment of $150 million by 2015. The airline plans to set up a maintenance, repair and
overhaul (MRO) facility at Vijayawada by 2015. It currently has a maintenance centre at the Chennai
International Airport.

Air Costa received two more Embraer E-170 jets, one in December 2013 and the other in January 2014.
It aims to have ten E-170s and E-190s by the end of 2014 and a total of 25 aircraft by 2018.

At the Singapore Airshow, Air Costa ordered 50 E-Jets E2 aircraft with option for another 50 from
Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, a deal worth $2.94 billion. Air Costa will become the first customer in
India of the E-Jet E2 with the first delivery in 2019.

Air Costa flies to nine destinations in India connecting metros to Tier-II cities. The cities it connects
include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Vijayawada, Madurai and
Visakhapatnam.

Regional Express, Australia, Tops The Charts

'Our heart is in the country'. That is the tagline and essence of Regional Express, the largest regional
airline from Australia and in the region. It has a fleet of 95 aircraft, 51 of them being Saab 340, followed
by 16 Piper Warrior, seven Westwind 1124 and other aircraft including a Brasilia 120 for exclusive
freighter service. Regional Express is popularly known as Rex.

regional aviation part of the business. They believed there were sound business reasons for this initiative.
Both Hazelton and Kendell, before they were part of Ansett, were profitable entities and enjoyed excellent
reputation and support. Both airlines were still in operation under their own brands, the route networks of
both operators were complementary and they operated the same types of aircraft.

Rex has its roots firmly in the bush and in country Australia. Rex believes that the bush needs and
deserves an air service of quality that provides good connectivity with capital cities at affordable prices.
Rex seeks to fulfil these expectations. Since its formation, Rex has steered a course balancing the needs
of regional communities for extensive and affordable air services and to be economically viable and
sustainable.
