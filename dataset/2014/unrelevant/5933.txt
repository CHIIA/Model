2350 GMT [Dow Jones] Woodside (WPL.AU) is undervalued and its strategy is sound, says Citigroup,
which reckons the Australian oil company will reveal Thursday it is getting higher prices for its LNG. The
broker, which rates Woodside a buy, says the LNG price details could prompt consensus earnings
upgrades of 7% to 8%. Woodside has copped some flak for paying 80% of its profit as dividends while it
struggles to find new investment options. Citigroup, however, says the scenario provides a 6% to 7%
dividend yield for the remainder of the decade, while leaving US$3.5 billion spare room for acquisitions.
"Woodside is delivering on a good strategy, with a clear order for capital allocation to target shareholder
returns greater than 15% per annum," the broker says, applying a A$46.44 price target. WPL is down
0.9% at A$38.36. (ross.kelly@wsj.com)

2342 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate near term after hitting a nearly two-year low
of $83.59 on Friday but settling up five cents at $85.82/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The
daily continuation chart is mixed as the five- and 15-day moving averages are declining and the MACD
indicator is bearish, but the slow stochastic measure is turning bullish in oversold territory. Resistance is
at $86.29 (Friday's high); a breach would be near-term positive, exposing the upside to $87.95
(Thursday's high), then to $88.63 (Wednesday's high), $90.57 (Tuesday's high), $90.74 (Oct. 6 high,
near the middle 20-day Bollinger Band), $91.79 (Oct. 3 high) and $92.96 (Oct. 1 high). But a drop below
the $83.59 support would reinstate the negative near-term outlook, exposing the downside to $82.10
(July 2, 2012, low), then to the psychological $80.00 line and $77.28 (June 28, 2012, swing low).
November crude is down 91 cents at $84.91/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2258 GMT [Dow Jones] A 0.8% fall in New Zealand food prices in September is in line with expectations
as food prices have remained largely flat over the last year, says ASB economist Christina Leung; "The
result adds to other inflation indicators pointing to a contained inflation environment." Leung adds that the
3Q CPI release due next Thursday will show annual inflation at around 1.2%; "With little urgency for the
RBNZ to resume its tightening cycle, we continue to expect the RBNZ will keep the OCR (official cash
rate) on hold at 3.5% until March 2015." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2246 GMT [Dow Jones] September Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, or REINZ, may show subdued
house sales due to election-related uncertainty, says Westpac Bank. Recent data from REINZ have been
weak, "hinting at a renewed slowdown in housing" but "it is not clear whether this was signal or noise,"
says Westpac. House sales fell 19% between September and April, and rose 4% between April and
August. While they may be weaker in September, Westpac says a rebound in October is possible. The
data are due early this week. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)

2241 GMT - Bell Potter remains positive about Australia's big general insurers. It defends buy
recommendations for Insurance Australia Group (IAG.AU), QBE Insurance (QBE.AU) and Suncorp
(SUN.AU) based on the defensive nature of the industry and operating scale of the three companies,
which are working to cut costs. It also says SUN has a large and likely growing capital surplus, while the
upside is likely greatest for QBE given its investments are shorter in duration and its claims liabilities
longer in duration. It has a target of A$6.75/share on IAG, A$13.10/share on QBE and A$15/share on
SUN. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2223 GMT - Highfield Resources (HFR.AU), which is developing a potash project in northern Spain,
offers 53% upside for investors betting that emerging economies such as Brazil and China will need
more fertilizer to sustain their food production, says Bell Potter. The broker has a buy call and A$0.90

study into its Muga-Vipasca project around mid-2015, but will likely need to raise around A$110 million
thereafter to fund the equity component of its development. Bell Potter also adopts a more conservative
price outlook on long-term potash prices of US$300/ton, compared with Highfield's estimate of around
US$400/ton. HFR last traded at A$0.585. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2218 GMT - Australian shares are likely to continue last week's slide, with no sign worries over the pace
of global growth are letting up. U.S. stocks capped a volatile week with losses Friday, and the Dow
industrials shifted back into negative territory for the year. IG forecasts an opening fall of 1.1% for the
S&P/ASX 200 to about 5127. Trade balance data due Monday out of China will be watched closely given
concerns over a slowdown in Australia's biggest trading partner have been one of the triggers for the
sharp and sustained selling in Aussie shares, IG market strategist Evan Lucas says. BHP Billiton
(BHP.AU) shares may weaken after the U.S. ADRs fell 1.1%, although the spot iron-ore price rose 0.5%
on Friday to US$79.90/ton, IG figures show. The ASX 200 ended Friday down 2.1% at 5188.3.

2209 GMT - If investor lending in Australia loses more steam then it would relieve a key constraint to
easier monetary policy, says J.P. Morgan. "The fact that further macro-prudential measures are expected
to be announced by year-end adds to this prospect," J.P. Morgan economist Ben Jarman says. The
value of loans for investment housing in Australia fell 0.1% in August from a month earlier, slowing
sharply from a 5.6% on-month rise in July, data showed Friday. "Of course, it's still possible that foreign
investment activity keeps prices going up," Mr. Jarman says, noting that Sydney is a potential hotspot.
That would leave the Reserve Bank of Australia with the existential question of whether it should care
about rising asset prices if there is no marginal leverage associated with it. "We suspect officials would
view such a situation as outside the purview of monetary policy," Mr. Jarman says.
