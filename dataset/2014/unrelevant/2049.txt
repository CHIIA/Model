MINING contractor Mineral Resources could stymie Baosteel and Aurizon’s $1.4 billion bid for Aquila
Resources.
Mineral Resources was yesterday confirmed as the mystery buyer of a $192 million strategic 12.8
per cent stake in Aquila. It paid between $3.72 and $3.75 for its 52 million shares.

That’s a significant premium to the $3.40-a-share $1.4 billion takeover bid for Aquila lobbed by
Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and Brisbane-based rail operator Aurizon late last month.

Mineral Resources chief Chris Ellison said the miner had the skills to build, own and operate key
infrastructure on Aquila’s proposed $10 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project. “We have the financial
capacity to make a meaningful capital contribution towards the development of the project and will
proceed to engage with all major stakeholders including Aquila and Baosteel to facilitate the best
outcome possible,” he said.
