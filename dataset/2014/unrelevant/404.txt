* Asian investors look poised to takeover Australian-owned food brands

* Goodman Fielder, who own Praise, Wonder White, in sell-off process

* Dick Smith slams looming $1.37 billion move saying Australians left with little choice at checkout

* It follows an exodus of proudly-owned Aussie foods now in overseas hands

Meadow Lea margarine and other signature Australian-owned brands, such as Helgas and Wonder
White breads, could become the latest home-grown food products to be sold in to foreign hands after
Asian investors bid $1.37 billion.

The companies, owned by Goodman Fielder, could be moved offshore in as little as four months as
the company board paves the way for Singapore oils trader Wilmar International and Hong Kong
investment house First Pacific to enter into a takeover.

Goodman Fielder owns and operates sugar refineries in North Queensland and Victoria, and the
company employs about 6000 people in Australia, NZ and Asia. A company spokesman said it
wasn't clear how many Australian-based jobs would be affected by the move.

Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith says the looming take-over is a blow to the Australian
home-grown food industry and customers who prefer to buy locally manufactured products.

A statement from Goodman Fielder released on Thursday said a recommendation had been put to its
board to accept a takeover bid from the two Asian investors at 71 cents a share.

Goodman Fielder has a portfolio of well-known consumer brands in some of Australia's largest
grocery categories, including Meadow Lea, Praise, White Wings, Pampas, Mighty Soft, Helga's,
Wonder White, Meadow Fresh and Irvines.
If the buy-out proceeds, the once proudly-owned Australian food brands will join the long list of former
iconic products Cottees Cordials, milk brands Dairy Farmers and Dare Iced Coffee, Bushells and
Nerada Teas and big biscuit manufacturer Arnott's to fall into foreign hands.

Smith said moves such are contributing to the demise of Australian-owned products.

'With more than 80 per cent of product in a typical supermarket trolley already either imported or
coming from a foreign-owned company, how long will it take for this figure to reach 90 per cent  or
even 95 per cent?' he said.
Company Chairman Steve Gregg said the move would be a positive for the company's expansion
into the Asian market.
“We believe this revised proposal also demonstrates the strength of our underlying business and
brands but also the opportunity to leverage these assets to grow the business across the Asian

Mr Smith said the growing sell-off of Australian-owned products into foreign hands leaves shoppers
with almost next to no choice but to buy foreign-owned at the checkout.
He said: 'Even the most patriotic consumers who want to buy Australian-made-and-Australian-owned
find they increasingly don’t have a choice and the problem is becoming exponentially worse.'
The buy-out will be subject to rigorous approvals, including a majority shareholder agreement and a
Federal Court decision.
