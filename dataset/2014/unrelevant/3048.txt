"Ceiling 5435. Floor 5390. Close at 5400, down 9.9 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract down 1 point. This week has been rather difficult to forecast given the slow grind
up that we have seen.

"This slow grind in addition to a number of other bearish tells is entirely consistent with a decline back to at
least 5250 before the final run up.

"But it is also consistent with a move to a new rally first, probably 5550, which would be the
penultimate/final high.

"I have been basing my forecasts on the former scenario playing out, and I will do the same today but in all
honesty it is probably now a line ball decision so I will hedge my bets with the high.

"The ceiling will be 5435. The floor will be 5390. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5400, down 9.9 points.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS

*AHE: SPP at $3.49 to be launched, capped at $10 mln
Automotive Holdings Group Ltd announced it will shortly launch a share purchase plan offering eligible
shareholders the opportunity to subscribe for new shares up to a value of $15,000 at $3.49 per new share.
The amount to be raised is capped at $10 million.
*CSR/BLD: To combine brick operations in NSW, Vic, Qld, SA, Tas, ACT
CSR Ltd and Boral Ltd announced they propose to form a j/v to combine their brick operations located on
the east coast of Australia including operations in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania
and t he ACT.
CSR and Boral will approach the ACCC to seek clearance for the transaction.

The proposed j/v will be owned 60% by CSR AND 40% by Boral to reflect the relative valuation of the two
businesses. No cash consideration is proposed.

Brick demand in Australia has experienced a sustained structural decline with bricks becoming an
increasingly smaller component of the broader claddng market. Lower brick demand has resulted in
declining capacity utilisation, reduced profitability, plant curtailments and closures.

Page40of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Combined revenue in the order of $230 million, initial overhead savings of $7/10 million per annum
following the formation of the j/v and integration of the businesses. Longer term, the consolidation of
selected manufacturing sites will lower unit costs of production and enable both companies to develop
selected high value land assets without impacting product range and operational capability. It also
positions the business to deliver returns that recover the cost of capital through building cycles.

The companies said a cahnge in the dwelling mix away from detached houses, traditionally more brick
intensive towards multi residential units, the virtual elimination of double brick construction from detached
houses on the east coast for frame and cladding systems with single brick veneer, emerging trends in
external facades to alternative cladding materials have reduced brick demand and impacted the brick
industry as a whole.

Cost synergies and the ability to develop certain sites over time without forgoing a similar product range or
operational capability is expected longer term.

*FSF/WOW: Fonterra wins long term milk supply contract to Woolworths

"The Age" reports New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra will start supplying private label milk to Australian
supermarkets for the first time after winning a long-term milk supply deal with Woolworths.

After a competitive tender, Woolworths has awarded its private label milk contract in Victoria - previously
held by Lion Dairy & Drinks - to Fonterra and given it a 10-year rather than a two-year contract.
The deal will see Fonterra invest more than $30 million into a state-of-the art milk processing plant at its
Cobden site in South West Victoria, creating 30 new jobs.
The Victorian contract is believed to be worth about $60 million a year.

Woolworths has also awarded a 10-year private label milk contract in Queensland to Parmalat, which has
been Woolworths' supplier in that state for several years.

In Western Australia, Lion Dairy & Drinks also lost its contract to Perth-based processor Brownes Dairies,
which has won a 7.5 year contract

Woolworths' decision to award long-term contracts in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia follows
the lead set last April by Coles, which signed a 10-year private label contract with Murray Goulburn for
Victoria and NSW.
*TCL/Others: ACCC not to oppose acquisition of Qld Motorways Group
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will not oppose the proposed acquisition by the
Transurban Consortium including Transurban Group of the toll road and associated assets of Queensland
Motorways Group. Transurban will be the entity responsible for operating the QM Group tollroad assets.
The consortium includes AustralianSuper Pty Ltd, Tawreed Investments Ltd, Transurban Holdings Ltd,
Transurban International Ltd and Transurban Infrastructure Management Ltd . ACCC Chairman Rod Sims
said in the report the ACCC concluded the acquisition of QM Group's tollroad operations in Queensland
would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition.

*XRO: Revenue for yr to March 31 up 83%, 2nd half loss in line with 1st half
Xero Ltd announced operating revenue of $NZ70.1 million for the year ended March 31 2014, up 83% up
from last year's $NZ38.4 million number.
With monthly committed subscriptions growing to $NZ7.8 million the recurring revenue model means that
Xero commences its 2015 financial year strongly with $NZ93 million in annualised subscriptions, up 81%
on the $NZ51.5 million reported for the same time last year. The net loss after tax for the second half of
the year ending March 31 2014 is expected to be similar to that reported for the first half, resulting in a full
year loss of approximately $NZ35 million vs $NZ14.4 million last year. Xero has expanded its team to
758 employees, adding 376 employees in the 2014 financial year, and has $NZ210 million of cash to fund
its growth.

The strong NZ dollar adversely impacts reported operating revenue given that 66% of revenue is
denominated in foreign currencies. On a constant currency basis Xero grew operating revenue by 92% in
the period.

Xero now has 284,000 paying customers - 102,000 in NZ, 109,000 in Australia, 47,000 in the UK, 18,000
in North America and 8,000 in the rest of the world, up from 157,000 a year ago with subscription revenue
up 84%.
