Norton Gold Fields’ hostile takeover of Bullabulling Gold has continued, with the Chinese-owned
gold miner yesterday increasing its stake to 15.9 per cent.

The stand-off between the companies will drag on for another fortnight after Norton on Monday
extended the offer period until June 16.

After launching the surprise $24 million bid on April 17, Norton’s voting power in Bullabulling has
grown from 2.5 per cent on the back of acceptances and market buying.

Tensions between the parties ramped up last month when Norton lodged a complaint with the
Federal Government’s Takeovers Panel about Bullabulling’s commentary on the 7-cents-a-share
offer.

A reply from the panel is believed to be imminent.
Norton, controlled by China’s biggest gold producer Zijin Mining Group, last month poured the
one millionth ounce at its Paddington operations since its $45 million acquisition from Barrick
Gold in 2007.
Norton delivered record gold production of 172,739oz last year and expects to produce between
176,000oz and 184,000oz this year.

Managing director Dianmin Chen has stated Norton has enough cash to fund the takeover and the
muscle to develop Bullabulling’s 3.7 million ounce project, weighed down by capital costs,
expected to be about $450 million.

Norton shares closed 9.5 per cent higher yesterday at 11.5 cents, while Bullabulling last changed
hands for 7.1 cents.
