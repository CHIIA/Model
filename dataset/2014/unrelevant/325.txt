A surge in the uranium spot price failed to help Paladin Energy’s bottom line, with the company
declaring a net after-tax loss from operations of $US45.8 million for the September quarter.

According to Paladin’s latest financial results, released late yesterday, revenue for the quarter
crashed 43 per cent to $US39.3 million.

The spot price of uranium rose 5 per cent in the quarter, from an average $US29.65 a pound in the
June period to $US31.17/lb in the last quarter. Paladin’s average received price in the period fell 18.3
per cent to $US31.16/lb.

Revenue was crunched by both the fall in its received price and a 25 per cent fall in production at the
Langer Heinrich mine — to 1.03 million pounds of uranium oxide — because of scheduled
maintenance shutdowns and “issues associated with unforseen processing circuit scaling”.

The unexpectedly big loss will put further pressure on Paladin’s balance sheet, despite the
completion of a $US190 million company-saving deal with China National Nuclear Corporation for
the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Langer Heinrich. Closure of the deal left Paladin with cash holdings
worth $US209.5 million at September 30.
Paladin also refinanced its existing $US110 million project finance loan and $US20 million working
capital facility in the quarter, and used some of the CNNC cash to pay down debt.
But the company still faces the task of refinancing $US300 million of convertible bonds maturing
next November, as well as paying $US40.4 million in interest and principal repayments before next
September.

Its shares gained 1.5¢ to 40¢.
