DEVELOPMENT: China’s Dalian Wanda Group is set to begin 2015 with a much bigger development
pipeline, with it closing in on major sites in Sydney and the Gold Coast.
In its biggest play yet, the Beijing-based group controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin is believed to be
finalising negotiations to buy Gold Fields House fronting Sydney Harbour.

Wanda will probably spend about $400 million on the building, currently controlled by Blackstone and
a group of pension funds, and convert it into a luxury apartment tower.
Blackstone this week said it was in talks with a party on the site, but the group and the agents on the
deal, CBRE and JLL, have declined to comment further.
On the Gold Coast, The Weekend Australian can reveal that Wanda and another Chinese company,
Ridong Group, have agreed terms to jointly develop a multi-billion-dollar resort at Nerang near the
Commonwealth Games village.It will be the second Gold Coast development the groups pursue
together, with Wanda joining Ridong earlier this year in the $900m Jewel apartment and hotel
complex.
