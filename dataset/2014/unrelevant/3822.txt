MORE than $2.35 billion worth of hotels are expected to change hands this year, but transaction
volumes are well down on previous years.
A report from Savills Hotels says 2014 transaction volumes were 22.5 per cent down on 2013 figures,
although a number of high-price landmark establishments sold during the year.

Apart from the recent $463 million sale of the Sheraton on the Park Hotel in Sydney to China’s
Sunshine Insurance Group, other big deals this year were the $360m sale of the Sofitel Hotel Darling
Park in Sydney to private hotelier Jerry Schwartz and the $135m sale of the Park Hyatt Melbourne
Hotel.
Led by Perth, national hotel occupancies jumped to 80.9 per cent in October, up from 79.2 per cent in
the previous year.
Perth achieved the highest hotel occupancies in October, averaging 89.7 per cent, followed by
Sydney and Melbourne both achieving 87.4 per cent, and Adelaide with 85.7 per cent, according to
STR Global.

The Savills Hotels report says the emerging Asian middle class with its thirst for overseas travel,
coupled with improved domestic business conditions, was benefiting the Australian hotel sector.

French hotelier Accor, meanwhile, continues to expand its network, yesterday announcing it would
rebrand the 109-room Four Points Sheraton Geelong as the Novotel Geelong and the 223-room
Chifley Hotel Penrith as the Mercure Penrith.

Accor is focusing on regional areas because of new infrastructure projects planned, including
Badgerys Creek Airport in Sydney’s west. “Areas such as Geelong and Penrith have been targeted for
major infrastructure projects that will attract both significant business travel as well as larger local
populations as a result of increased work opportunities and proximity to Melbourne and Sydney
respectively,” Accor Pacific COO Simon McGrath said.
The InterContinental Hotels Group, the world largest, also recently announced it would manage the
former Rydges Hotelssite in the heart of Perth. Owned by an Asian investor, the 240-room hotel will
open as an Inter-Continental by early 2017.Big regional hotel sales during the year included the $48m
sale of the Novotel Northbeach Hotel in Wollongong, south of Sydney.
