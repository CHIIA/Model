SYDNEY -- Hong Kong billionaireLi Ka-shing emerged triumphant in a takeover battle for Australian
gas-transmission companyEnvestra Ltd. after a rival bidder agreed to support his 2.37 billion
Australian dollar (US$2.22 billion) offer.

The victory gives Asia's richest man access to a network of pipelines that span a combined 22,500
kilometers and distribute natural gas to households and businesses in major Australian cities such as
Melbourne and Adelaide. It also adds to a string of offshore deals for Mr. Li in recent years as he
disposes of some assets in Hong Kong, and comes just days after it was revealed he was considering
a bid for an Irish aircraft-leasing company.

Mr. Li's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. is leading a consortium that offered A$1.32 per
Envestra share, trumping an earlier bid from Australia's APA Group Ltd. and pitting two of Envestra's
biggest shareholders against each other.

Rather than raise its offer, APA said Thursday that it had decided to sell its 33% interest in Envestra to
the Cheung Kong-led group.

"The cash offer put forward by the consortium well exceeded our valuation of the Envestra business,
even at full ownership," said Mick McCormack, APA's chief executive officer.
Mr. Li's offer for Envestra places a high value on the company by historical standards. The shares
have rarely traded as high as A$1.32, having previously only come close to that level in 2007, just
before the global financial crisis took hold.

In May, Cheung Kong said it would attempt to generate cost savings by combining Envestra's
operations with some of its other Australian power assets. Cheung Kong also owns 51% of both SA
Power Networks in South Australia state and Victoria Power Networks in Victoria state. About 80% of
Envestra's assets are located in those two states.

Cheung Kong appears to be paying a large premium for Envestra, based on other recent deals in
Australia's power sector, such as State Grid Corp. of China's acquisition of a stake in SP AusNet
Ltd., said Nathan Lead, a Brisbane-based senior analyst at broker Morgans.
"I just wonder if it's part of a bigger roll-up play for them," Mr. Lead said. "They've potentially got an
appetite for further investments in the energy-infrastructure space."

Pipelines that connect gas fields to export plants, power generators and homes are typically monopoly
assets that can provide steady, regulated returns to investors. APA owns big pipelines to export hubs
and cities, while Envestra owns the thousands of so-called spaghetti strands that run to separate
end-users.
Australia, the world's 12th-largest economy, has seven gas-export terminals valued at A$180 billion
under construction on its coastline to feed utilities overseas, supporting a need for transmission
infrastructure and sparking a spate of deals in the pipeline sector. APA in 2012 paid US$1.36 billion
for rival pipeline owner Hastings Diversified, while last year local pension fund QIC Global
Infrastructure beat out Cheung Kong among others to buy the Moomba-to-Adelaide gas pipeline.
