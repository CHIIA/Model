MARKET RETREATS FURTHER MAYBE EYEING CHINA MARKET

Our market ignored a better than expected GDP number to close down 34.9 points to 5444.8, 2 points
above the low of the day on volume worth $3.7 billion, on the light side.
China's physical and Hong Kong futures markets both fell quite sharply. May not be related but the
scandal at one port last night, plus memories of Tianmen Square massacre may be weighing on the
market.

(FastMarkets reported at the port of Qingdao authorities have stopped the shipment of some material
while they investigate the alleged cases of multiple financing, or loans using the same warehouse
receipts as collateral. Trades in China said the seized material is mostly aluminium as well as some
copper concentrate, not refined copper or nickel. Traders told FastMarkets getting finance for metal had
already become more difficult, and this will be exacerbated by the Qingdao news).

points above midswaps, the nation’s first issuance in the European currency since 2006. The dollar bond
sale drew 4.5 times more bids than offered, while the euro debt attracted 4 times the amount, the finance
ministry said in an e-mailed statement.
