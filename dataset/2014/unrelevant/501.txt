Cromwell Property Group will convert two major government office towers in Brisbane to
residential, following a trend that has caught on in Sydney.
Cromwell purchased Health House and Forestry House in May last year for $65 million. The
properties have a net lettable area of 26,650 square metres and a land area of about 3500 square
metres.

"We will look to have an alternative use; I don't think it will stack up as offices," Cromwell chief
executive Paul Weightman said.

With as much as 100,000 square metres of space being laid empty by the state government and a
record high office vacancy rate, other city landlords are investigating similar conversions. Investa is
looking at converting its former Boeing House in Adelaide Street to residential.
Frasers Hospitality purchased an 18-storey office tower in Brisbane last year for $37 million and is
converting it into a hotel, while Singapore-based SilverNeedle is also converting Lennons Plaza into
a hotel.
The trend follows movement in Sydney where there has been numerous conversion plans. Chinese
group Maville proposes to convert a Kent Street commercial building into a 24-storey residential
tower, while Cbus is converting an office tower at 130 Elizabeth Street into a residential complex
with 150 apartments.
