PROPERTY tycoon Bob Ell has cashed in on the Chinese investment boom by selling an office tower on
Sydney Harbour for $80m.
The Australian property legend will reap a gain of about $30 million on the sale of the tower, 52 Alfred
Street, which he picked up about four years ago from a Colonial First State-managed fund.

The 13 storey tower is leased to health products groupKimberly-Clark but a conversion into apartments is
seen as likely.
Bridgehill has been among the top buyers of apartment sites and its luxury projects have also won
support from offshore buyers. It forked out $82 million last August for an old council depot in Zetland,
south Sydney, where it is planning a series of unit towers.
It also recently sold out a planned luxury apartment conversion of the nearby TAL building in Milsons
Point. Agents CBRE were finalised the latest site purchase last night.
Chinese groups have forged into major capital cities to secure key sites for landmark developments.
