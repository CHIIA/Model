(SeeNews) - Jan 15, 2014 - Hydro Tasmania on Tuesday inaugurated its 168-MW Musselroe wind
farm in Tasmania, jointly owned with Chinese firm Shenhua Clean Energy Holdings Pty Ltd (SCE).
The Australian hydro and wind power firm said on its website on Tuesday that the 56-turbine facility in
northeastern Tasmania has generated first power in April 2013. It is operated by Woolnorth Wind Farm
Holdings -- a 25/75 joint venture between Hydro Tasmania and SCE.

The AUD-394-million (USD 352m/EUR 258m) complex, the construction of which was initiated in
December 2011, is estimated to generate enough electricity to supply up to 50,000 households per
year. In addition, it is expected to offset 450,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according
to the developers’ calculations.
Woolnorth Wind Farm Holdings operates another two wind parks in northwestern Tasmania. The
Australian firm owns a 25% stake in the facilities, while SCE holds the controlling 75% share.

(AUD 1.0 = USD 0.891/EUR 0.654)
