Section: Business News - The SET-listed Banpu Plc, Asean's top coal miner, posted first-quarter net
profit growth of 120% year-on-year to US$55 million (1.78 billion baht), primarily due to coal swap
profits and improved coal operations in Indonesia and Australia, the Bangkok Post reports.

Chief executive Chanin Vongkusolkit said Banpu's sales volume from its mines in Indonesia and Australia
increased by almost 10% from 9.98 million to 10.9 million tonnes.

As coal prices remain unfavourable, its sales revenue slid 1% to US$831 million.
Coal sales totalled US$771 million, accounting for 93% of revenue, with the rest coming from sales of
power and steam from its three combined heat and power plants in China.
The fall in coal prices resulted in a lower average selling price (ASP) of Indonesian coal, but the ASP of
Australian coal rose to A$75.40 (2,300 baht) per tonne from A$65.56 as export volume soared on the
back of the Australian dollar's depreciation against the greenback.
In the first quarter, Banpu gained US$30 million in profits from coal swap deals," Mr Chanin said, adding
that improvements in production efficiency and cost management have resulted in a decrease in
production costs at both Indonesian and Australian mines.
During the quarter, production costs at Indonesian coal mines reduced to US$44.78 per tonne from
US$53.70, while Australian operations' production costs decreased to A$52.98 per tonne from A$58.41.
The ability to manage sales costs has resulted in a higher gross profit margin (GPM) in the coal business
in the quarter to 35% from 27% in the same period last year, Mr Chanin said.
Meanwhile, weakening coal prices helped lower production costs in the power business, enabling its
GPM in the quarter to surge to 33% from 29% in the same period last year, he added.
Mr Chanin said the company also received US$26 million worth of equity income from affiliated
businesses, consisting of US$20 million from BLCP, in which Banpu has a 50% shareholding, and
US$4.7 million from its Chinese coal business.
With coal mining and related businesses in Thailand, Indonesia, China, Australia, Laos and Mongolia,
Banpu's total assets were US$7.3 billion as of March, an increase of US$180 million from the figure in
December last year.
Its net debts amounted to 2.7 billion, while its net debt-to-equity ratio was 1.01 times compared with 1.1
times in the first quarter last year.

Earnings per share were 2.1 US cents per share in the first quarter, up by 133% from 0.9 cents per share
in the same period last year.
BANPU shares closed on May 14 on the SET at 29.50 baht, up 25 satang, in trade worth 644 million
baht.
