DEAL-STARVED bankers and legal firms are eyeing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a loosening of
regulation across Asia as ushering in a new ``golden age of growth and prosperity'', but the wave of
cross-border takeover deals it is likely to spark will throw up new tests for the Foreign Investment
Review Board and Joe Hockey.

As the government kicks off its deregulation agenda, an inaugural report on merger and acquisitions
in the Asia-Pacific by law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, to be released today, predicts that to
accommodate the changing landscape there may be a shake-up of Australia's foreign investment
regime in place since the 1970s.

Concern about Australia's attitudes to foreign investment spiked after the Treasurer last year blocked
US giant Archer Daniels Midland's $3.4 billion takeover of grains handler GrainCorp following
pressure from the Nationals.
After that decision, Mr Hockey did approve State Grid Corporation of China's acquisition of stakes in
Australia's energy infrastructure, which Freehills said indicated GrainCorp was blocked due to unique
circumstances.
While the Abbott government has vowed to be ``open for business'', foreign acquisitions of
agriculture, mining and property assets have sparked concerns in recent years, with the Chinese
buying more than $5bn worth of residential property a year, according to Credit Suisse.

Tony Damian, a partner at Freehills, which has extended its reach into Asia with its 2012 merger with
Britain's Herbert Smith, said the FIRB would only get busier as cross-border M&A in the region rose
amid a relaxation of regulatory barriers in countries from China to Indonesia.

He said the national interest test, regarded by many as an opaque measure that was easily subject to
the whims of politics of the day, as well as other aspects of the regime could be reviewed, after the
Coalition pushed for a Senate committee into foreign investment in agriculture before the election.

``It's absolutely possible (the national interest test could be changed). It seems to be on the cards . . .
and if that happened it would be significant,'' Mr Damian said.

``Is national interest the right test? What does it mean? This current government through pursuing, for
instance the Korea free trade agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, demonstrates it is very
much in favour of those capital flows as opposed to being against them.''

Mr Damian said the removal of barriers to capital flows across the Asia-Pacific would result in a
``golden age of growth and prosperity'', citing the Trans-Pacific Partnership as critical.

The partnership would form a massive free trade bloc in the Asia-Pacific, including Japan, the US,
Singapore, Malaysia and Australia. In addition, the relaxation of outbound investment in China and
reforms in Myanmar, Singapore and Indonesia would further drive activity between nations -- and the
deal flow for law firms and investment banks.

really is groundbreaking economic and legal architecture, and I do believe it will drive this golden age
of growth and prosperity in the region, and it will see increased capital flows, unhindered by many of
the legal and regulatory barriers that exist today -- and therefore lots more deals.''

Mr Damian's comments come as a survey of fund managers by Merrill Lynch showed investors were
favouring emerging markets

such as Indonesia winning the ``race to reform''.
In the latest major cross-border deal, Singapore-based CapitaLand yesterday sold its $844 million
stake in property group Australand.
In a soft M&A market, foreign acquisitions of Australian companies fell 22 per cent to $US29.4bn last
year, according to Thomson Reuters.
Law firm Gilbert + Tobin has tipped a potential M&A revival as foreign bidders return after ``keeping
their powder dry'' last year.
Gilbert + Tobin said the extraordinary battle for Warrnambool Cheese & Butter, won by Canada's
Saputo, pointed to a return of animal spirits and that foreign bidders would face smoother conditions
this year.

``With the Australian dollar now coming off its recent highs, and the prospect of a more stable federal
government, 2014 could see a return of foreign bidders,'' the firm said.
