Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board has approved the proposed acquisition of
Bullabulling Gold by Chinese-owned Norton Gold Fields.

Norton yesterday declared the 7c-a-share bid was unconditional and urged Bullabulling
shareholders to accept the offer.

Bullabulling responded yesterday by reiterating the view of chairman Peter Mansell, who last
week labelled the takeover offer which closes on June 2 as “inadequate and opportunistic”.

Bullabulling shares traded 5 per cent lower yesterday at 7.2c, but still at a premium since the April
17 bid was announced. Yesterday’s share price valued the company at $25.1 million, according
to Bloomberg.

The Brett Lambert-run Bullabulling has been targeting mid-2016 for first production at its 3.75
million ounce gold project near Coolgardie.
Norton’s biggest shareholder, China’s Zijin Mining Group, already controls 2.5 per cent of
Bullabulling shares.
