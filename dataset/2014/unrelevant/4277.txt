Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. Chairman Andrew Forrest has acquired more shares in the Australian iron
ore miner, investing about another A$7.0 million to raise his stake to around 33.2%, according to a June
19 ASX filing.

Forrest purchased 1,750,000 shares on June 16 and June 17 in an on-market trade, increasing the total
number of shares held to 1,033,479,247.

The acquisition represents about a 0.06% increase in interest based on Fortescue's current
3,110,000,000 shares on issue.

Forrest has been progressively buying up more shares over the past few months, having picked up an
extra 2,000,000 shares between May 1 and May 5 at a cost of A$9.7 million.
Fortescue revealed June 16 that it has contracted a Chinese shipyard to build four large ore carriers at a
cost of about US$275 million in a bid to reduce its transport costs.
The 260,000 deadweight tonnage class vessels will account for about 6% of the company's shipping fleet
requirements.

CEO Neville Power said at the time the new vessels will help boost efficiencies at Fortescue's Herb Elliott
port facility, located within the Port Hedland harbor in Western Australia, as well as lower costs.
