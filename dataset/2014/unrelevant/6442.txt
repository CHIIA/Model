Takeovers A JOINT takeover bid for Aquila by China’s Baosteel and Australian rail operator Aurizon
is a step closer, with another key shareholder poised to accept the $1.4 billion offer.
Aquila co-founder Charles Bass, who holds a 10.7 per cent stake in the target, intends to take up the
offer in early July. The company’s chairman Tony Poli, who holds 28.9 per cent stake, has already
said he intends to accept the offer.

However, both men say they reserve the right to change their minds. “Upon Mr Bass and Mr Poli
accepting the offer (in accordance with their current statements of intention), the bidders will have a
relevant interest in Aquila of over 50 per cent, and the minimum acceptance condition of the offer will
be satisfied,” Baosteel and Aurizon said in a statement.

Baosteel and Aurizon have seen off a rival bid for Aquila from Mineral Resources, which holds just
under 13 per cent of the explorer.
The pair were keen to take control of Aquila so they can kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara
Iron Ore Project.Its shares dipped 1c to $3.37, while Aurizon shed 4c to $4.96.
