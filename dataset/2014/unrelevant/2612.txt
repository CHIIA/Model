ATLANTA, July 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Interface, Inc. (Nasdaq: TILE), a worldwide carpet tile company
and global leader in sustainability, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 29, 2014.

"Second quarter results are a vast improvement over the slow start to the year that we saw in the first
quarter," said Daniel T. Hendrix, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong sales in the corporate
office market in Europe, mostly in the U.K. and Germany, were accompanied by continued steady growth
in our Americas business, which made considerable gains in non-office segments. In our Asia-Pacific
division, Australia and China contributed to the top line improvement, while Southeast Asia remained
relatively even year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, orders continued to grow at a robust pace, up
10% to an all-time high of $284 million, giving us more optimism about the second half of the year."

SECOND QUARTER 2014 FINANCIAL SUMMARY & HIGHLIGHTS

Sales: Sales for the second quarter of 2014 were up 7.0% to $260.6 million, compared with $243.5 million
in the second quarter of 2013.

China also contributed to the growth, with Southeast Asia

Operating Income: Second quarter 2014 operating income increased to $24.3 million, or 9.3% of sales,
compared with $21.8 million, or 9.0% of sales, in the second quarter last year. Gross profit margin was
34.7% in the second quarter of 2014, compared with 35.4% in the prior year period, but represented an
improvement of 60 basis points sequentially compared with the first quarter this year. SG&A expenses
were $66.0 million, or 25.3% of sales, in the second quarter of 2014, versus $64.4 million, or 26.5% of
sales, in the second quarter of 2013. The year-over-year SG&A percentage improvement was mostly due
to improved sales volume, reduced equity compensation, and reduced marketing activity in Europe.

Page88of234©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Net Income: Net income during the second quarter of 2014 increased to $13.1 million, or $0.20 per share,
compared with net income of $11.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the second quarter last year.

Patrick C. Lynch, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "We're generally pleased
with our top line performance in the second quarter, and we continued on the path of sequential gross
margin improvement while keeping our SG&A expenses contained in relation to our sales level. We're also
pleased about the substantial progress in Australia, with sales approaching pre-fire levels and operations
beginning to normalize as we complete the ramp up of the Minto plant. With strong order momentum
pointing to higher sales, our focus for the remainder of the year will be on expanding gross margin and
keeping SG&A in check."

YEAR TO DATE 2014 FINANCIAL RESULTS

Sales: For the first six months of 2014, sales increased 5.7% to $479.6 million, compared with $453.9
million in the first six months last year.

Operating Income: Operating income for the 2014 six-month period was $36.4 million, or 7.6% of sales.
Operating income in the first six months of 2013 was $35.8 million, or 7.9% of sales.
Net Income: The Company reported net income of $17.1 million, or $0.26 per share, for the first six
months of 2014. This compares with net income of $16.1 million, or $0.24 per share, in the first six months
of 2013, excluding a previously-reported tax dispute resolution benefit of $1.9 million, or $0.03 per share.
With the tax resolution benefit included, net income in the first six months of 2013 was $18.0 million, or
$0.27 per share

Mr. Hendrix concluded, "We expect the second half of the year to be better than the first, based on strong
demand in Europe and steady performance in our U.S. business, which has yet to see a true office market
rebound this year. We also expect to improve gross margin, as we complete the Minto plant ramp-up and
rebalancing of production in the Asia-Pacific region, alongside our lean manufacturing and other efficiency
and cost reduction initiatives worldwide. SG&A will be closely scrutinized, with a prioritization of
investments having short-term paybacks. Another of our top priorities in the third quarter will be a
restructuring of FLOR with management changes and a renewed emphasis on attracting and retaining
customers, expanding its store footprint, and driving its growth and profitability."

The Company believes that the above non-GAAP performance measures, which management uses in
managing and evaluating the Company's business, may provide users of the Company's financial
information with additional meaningful bases for comparing the Company's current results and results in a
prior period, as these measures reflect factors that are unique to one period relative to the comparable
period. However, these non--GAAP performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an
alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Tax effects identified above (when applicable) are calculated using the statutory tax rate for
the jurisdictions in which the charge or income occurred.
