SYDNEY, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australian port and rail freight companyAsciano Ltd reported on
Thursday that annual underlying net profit grew 2 percent, missing analyst forecasts, as growth in coal,
container and car volumes was offset by a downturn in resources-related activity.

Asciano, the country's only locally owned ports operator, posted net profit, excluding restructuring
costs, of A$349.8 million for the year to June 30, compared with A$342.5 million the previous year.
Asciano was expected to post an annual net profit of A$363.64 million, according to the average
forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Including costs associated with integrating two rail units and redeveloping a port in Sydney, net profit
fell 23.9 percent to A$254.4 million.
Asciano revealed last month it was in early talks to sell a stake in its ports and logistics business, with
media reporting that state-run China Merchants Group Ltd was interested in a deal that could be worth
up to $1 billion. Such a sale would free up cash for the company to spend making its ports business
more efficient. (Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Leslie Adler)
