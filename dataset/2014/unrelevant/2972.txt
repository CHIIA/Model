Aug 28 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT

sells a pay TV channel and doesn't block rivals from its internet network, two people familiar with the
matter said on Thursday.

rival Family Dollar Stores Inc and that its offer was both superior and achievable than an offer from

transfer its holding in chip maker STMicroelectronics NV by the end of the year, a senior official said on
Thursday. The Eni stake sale could raise just under 3 billion euros at current market prices, with 2
billion coming from the Enelstake.

** Britain's CSR Plc has rebuffed an approach from Microchip Technology Inc, saying its U.S. rival
would have to pay more if it wants to bolster its role in the "Internet of Things" with the chipmaker's radio
technology.

** The state of Western Australia on Thursday said it planned to sell government-owned assets,
including part of the Port Hedland shipping terminal, for an estimated A$1 billion to A$2 billion ($1.9
billion) as its resource-heavy economy adjusts to the collapse of a decade-long mining boom.
** Two Chinese firms are among companies which have approached STATS ChipPAC Ltd about
acquiring it, the Singapore provider of technology services said on Thursday.
STATS ChipPAC, which has a market value of $1.2 billion and is majority owned by state investor
Temasek Holdings, identified Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co and Tianshui Huatian
Technology Co as possible bidders.
