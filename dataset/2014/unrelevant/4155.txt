Chinalco Yunnan Copper Resources Ltd. said April 14 that it entered into a memorandum of
understanding to create a new joint venture with Yunnan Copper Mineral Resources Exploration &
Development Co. Ltd. over two exploration permits, part of the Roseby South copper-gold project in
Queensland, Australia.
In September 2013, Chinalco inked a farm-in agreement to earn up to a 70% interest in six exploration
permits owned by Altona Mining Ltd. within the Roseby project.

Under the proposed joint venture, Chinalco will continue as the manager of project activities.

The arrangement will be split into two stages. The first stage will cover the first two years of the project
farm-in, while the second stage will deal with the following years under the farm-in and joint venture.
As part of the first stage, Yunnan Copper committed to spend A$900,000 on the two exploration permits
in 2014, with Chinalco spending a minimum A$400,000 in the other areas.
Yunnan Copper has the option to withdraw or continue in 2015. In case it continues, Yunnan Copper will
commit a further A$600,000 on the two permits in 2015 with covering the balance funding.
At the end of the second year, Chinalco will secure 30% of the four exploration permits and Yunnan
Copper will have 27% of the two permits under the joint venture.
During the second stage, Yunnan Copper will potentially earn up to 27% of the second-phase 30%
interest in the two permits.
In addition, Chinalco said it will withdraw from the remainder of its exploration portfolio in Chile to focus
its exploration activities on its Mount Isa projects in Australia.
In addition, the company and its 51% Chinese-registered subsidiary, Yunnan Copper San Mu Mining
Industry Co. Ltd., will abandon their projects in Laos after failing to secure purchase offers.
Chinalco also approved a 2014 work program and budget for A$2 million for exploration to further define
existing copper, gold and other mineralization at prospects such as Millenium and define drill targets for
2015 and 2016. Initially, the company is planning to conduct a seven-hole reverse circulation exploration
drilling program, to commence late April or early May, at a cost of A$230,000.
