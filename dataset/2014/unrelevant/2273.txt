Mobile biz CSL sale by Telstra supports broker's view of increased 2014 dividend ..

A leading broker on December 20 retained an "underweight" on Telstra with a share price target of $4.50.
This follows Telstra's sale of its Hong Kong based mobile business CSL to HKT for $2 billion, an
attractive 9.5x EV/EBITDA multiple, eps neutral in 2014.

The broker said it views this as a positive transaction for TLS shareholders as TLS is exiting a non core
mobile market with the added $2 billion to the 2014 FCF supporting its view of a higher dividend sooner
rather than later. The broker added franking credits will not be an issue for increasing dividends "TLS
could in fact pay up to a 37c per share fully franked dividend because TLS will be paying 14 months of
cash taxes in 2014 - "more cash taxes means more franking credits generated" the broker added.

TLS up 1c to $5.26.

On December 19 following Wotif's downgrade of its earnings, a leading broker retained an "underweight"
on the stock while lowering its price target to $2.40 from $3.75.

The broker said the downgrade shows that WTF is clearly losing share of online accommodation
bookings, and now appears to be losing share of total bookings. The broker said its view has been
supported by the fact that Booking.com chose Australia as the first market outside the US to roll out its
offline marketing campaign.

The broker added, "Lower sales, higher costs and competitors with scale, competence and very deep
pockets make for years of sequential earnings decline and an unattractive investment case".

WTF down 2.5c to $2.74.5.

CFS Retail Property Trust lifted to "accumulate", price target raised ..

A leading broker on December 19 lifted CFS Retail Property Trust to "accumulate" from "lighten"
previously while the price target was lifted to 42.17 from $2.10.

The broker said its upgrade followed Commonwealth Managed Investment Ltd as responsible entity of
CFS Retail Property Trust having reached agreement with CBA to internalise CFS Retail for $460 million.

"Given the fair price being paid for what were evergreen rights and the trust trading close to pro forma
NTA, we upgrade our recommendation on CFS Retail to Accumulate and raise our target price to $2.17"
the broker said, adding that the proposal is subject to 75% approval at a meeting of security holders
expected in March 2014.

CFX down .8c to $1.93.7

Whitehaven Coal "add" reiterated ..
A leading broker on December 23 reiterated an "add" recommendation for Whitehaven Coal, with a target
price of $2.25, unchanged.

The broker said in its November 27 note "Wait, but get ready" it had demonstrated that WHC at $1.60
was being priced for balance sheet stress. three of 5 key milestones have now been met and WHC has
already begun to re-rate.

"However, our conservative valuation of $2.65 per share suggests there still is good upside from here and
we upgrade our recommendation. Buy for a 15% bounce to $2.25 before revisiting key assumptions post
the late January quarterly" the broker added.

WHC up 4c to $1.95.
