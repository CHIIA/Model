0140 GMT - After posting another quarter of falling sales, Gucci names a new head of China to help turn
around its large business in the region. Merinda Yeung will fill a post that has been vacant since January.
Kering SA, Gucci's parent, hopes Ms. Yeung will be able to revive sales after a government crackdown
on luxury gifts hurt the iconic brand. She is expected to attempt better distribution controls and limit the
rising gray market in China while improving customers' experience in Gucci stores. The fashion brand's
sales have been falling in the last several months both in mainland China and Hong Kong.

2357 GMT [Dow Jones]--Risks to Australia's housing market are nothing new for the country's prudential
regulator. Deutsche Bank notes that the regulator, as it has in the past, is again gathering information,
counseling more aggressive lenders, seeking assurances for the boards of Australian lenders that they
are monitoring lending standards, and has undertaken a comprehensive stress test. As such, the
brokerage doesn't believe the regulator is interested in introducing hard macroprudential standards or
significantly increasing capital requirements to cool housing growth. "Market concerns around overly
constrictive macroprudential measures are overplayed," it says. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2347 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan thinks Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AU) may look to sell its
interest in the Iron Bridge magnetite project over the long run. Last year, Taiwan's largest private
company, Formosa Plastics Group, agreed to invest US$1.15 billion for a 31% stake in the project and
access to some of the raw material mined at the site for its Ha Tinh steel mill in Vietnam, due to become
operational in 2015. "The magnetite processing operation is progressing with Formosa funding the
project," says analyst Lyndon Fagan, but "the key issue for the 1.5-million-ton per annum operation is
that the technology has not been used before and costs are not yet proven." Consequently, the bank
thinks FMG will look for the exit and focus on its core Pilbara iron-ore operations. J.P. Morgan has an
overweight rating on the stock with a A$4.35 target. FMG trades down 2.3% at A$3.45.

2341 GMT [Dow Jones]--Too much uncertainty is swirling around Leighton Holdings (LEI.AU) for
Deutsche Bank to take a firmer view of Australia's biggest construction company. Leighton had a good
third quarter of its fiscal year, notably with net profit margins maintained in a range of 2.5% to 3%, which
suggests the company's program to cut costs and improve efficiency have delivered a sustainable
improvement in profitability. Still, the broker says the outcome of the company's plans to sell assets
including John Holland and large underclaims remain unresolved. The broker cuts its price target by
4.5% to A$19.96/share, retains a hold call. LEI last traded at A$20.88. (david.winning@wsj.com;

2340 GMT [Dow Jones] With New Zealand's annual CPI inflation unlikely to print above 1.5% until the
middle of 2015 "the RBNZ is under no pressure to signal further rate hike before then," says Harbour
Asset Management Head of Fixed Interest & Economics Christian Hawkesby. He notes, however, the
actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve are "a key uncertainty" regarding the actual timing of the next RBNZ
move. "The earlier the U.S. Federal Reserve begins lifting the Fed Funds, the more pressure there will
be for the NZ dollar to fall, helping lift tradeables and overall New Zealand inflation. So the timing of the
US Fed will create an environment where it is easier for the RBNZ to continue lifting the OCR," he says.

Industries (API.AU) by 6.7% to A$0.80/share, retains a buy call, after the company said same-store
sales at its Priceline pharmacy chain rose by 6% in FY14. "Coupled with an expected further lift in store
numbers, this suggests the group's strategic positioning in the health and beauty sector is gaining
traction," Deutsche says. Sales success should attract more pharmacists, supporting the wholesaling
operations despite the loss of customers in recent M&A activity, the broker adds. Deutsche ups its
forecast net profit for FY15 by 4.5% to A$34.7 million, citing higher retail sales and market share gains
in wholesale that should offset the effect of rivals Sigma Pharmaceuticals (SIP.AU) and Ebos (EBO.NZ)
purchasing two customer groups recently. API last traded at A$0.72. (david.winning@wsj.com;

2325 GMT [Dow Jones]--Atlas Iron (AGO.AU) has failed to allay Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Young's
concerns about its ability to weather falling iron-ore prices. Atlas's average sales price of US$69/ton in
1Q was below Young's expectation of US$74/ton, and the analyst thinks it has limited ability to bring
costs down further. At current iron-ore prices and foreign-exchange rates, Atlas's net debt would
increase to A$120 million by end-2015. "Under the current pricing environment we remain cautious on
the company's ability to generate free cash flow," Young says. Deutsche retains a hold recommendation
on concerns around product discounts, and cuts price target by 8.3% to A$0.55/share. AGO last traded
at A$0.36. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2314 GMT [Dow Jones]--September's larger-than-expected NZ trade deficit was attributable to the
inclusion of aircraft imports into the trade figures, with the broader strength of imports suggesting
domestic demand remains reasonably solid, says ANZ in a note: "With more aircraft imports on the
horizon, falls to commodity export prices are likely to contribute to deteriorating net trade picture, with the
return to annual trade deficits in prospect." Air New Zealand imported one Boeing Dreamliner in
September with another expected to arrive this month. The Dreamliner push imports of aircrafts and
parts to NZ$459 million vs. NZ$27 million a year ago. The September trade deficit was NZ$1.35 billion
vs. market expectations of NZ$675 million. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2312 GMT [Dow Jones]--If Telstra (TLS.AU) hoped its investor day would bring round skeptics to the
potential for its new business streams, then it didn't quite manage it with J.P. Morgan analyst Paul
Brunker. "We think that the growth avenues that Telstra has are genuine but too small to make a lot of
difference for a long time at least," he says. The problem is that a relatively small shift in assumptions
about the profitability of its base fixed-line and mobile products units could outweigh any upside from the
new business streams. Brunker says Telstra trading at a rich valuation so retains a neutral call. TLS last
traded at A$5.50, above J.P. Morgan's revised A$5.12/share price target. (david.winning@wsj.com;

2306 GMT [Dow Jones]--Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AU) says it is seeking to arrange a
series of institutional investor meetings in Sydney and Melbourne late this month to discuss a potential
AUD capital issue. The issue being considered would be Basel III-compiant Tier 2 capital and form part
of CBA's ongoing capital management plans. Any transaction will be subject to investor feedback and
prevailing market conditions. The possible size of the issue hasn't been disclosed.

2303 GMT [Dow Jones]--Apple shares continue to fly high on the strength of better-than-expected
quarterly results announced earlier this week, closing at a record high Thursday. Apple shares, which
also found support in a broad rally for U.S. equities, rose 1.8% to finish at $104.83, beating its previous
best of $103.30 set on Sept. 2. The stock has gained 7.3% this week and has risen 40% over the past
year. (Stephen.wisnefski@wsj.com; @wisnefski)

2254 GMT [Dow Jones]--Lonsec Stockbroking is telling advisors and investors to subscribe to the
Australian government's upcoming IPO of Medibank Private, the country's largest health insurer. Lonsec
estimates Medibank will deliver investors an above average return-on-equity of about 18%. It expects
compound EPS growth of 6% a year over fiscal 2015-2017. The government launched the IPO with an
indicative price range of A$1.55-A$2 a share. Lonsec has a FY16 valuation target of A$2.33/share. The
biggest risks it sees to the insurer's business are from any adverse change to government and regulatory
policies and volatility in investment income. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
