The Australian Foreign Investment Review Board has advised China's state-owned Baosteel and
Australian rail haulage company Aurizon that it has no objections to their proposed A$1.4 billion ($1.3
billion) acquisition of Aquila Resources, Baosteel and Aurizon said in a joint statement Thursday.

In early May, Queensland-based Aurizon and Baosteel made a joint takeover bid for Perth-based
Aquila at A$3.40/share.

"We are extremely pleased that the FIRB conditions for this transaction have been fulfilled. At the same
time, Baosteel believes the transaction, if successful, provides a genuine opportunity for the
development of greenfield resources for the benefit of both Australia and China," Baosteel chairman
Zhihao Dai said in the statement.

Baosteel and Aurizon need a 50% minimum acceptance from Aquila's shareholders. But Aquila has
advised its shareholders to take no action, until advised to do so from the company's board.
Aquila is developing the 30 million mt/year West Pilbara iron ore project as a 50:50 joint venture with
American Metals & Coal International. The project requires port access at the undeveloped Anketell
Point, located west of Port Hedland, as well as a 282-km railway leading to the port.
Aquila is also developing the Eagle Downs hard coking coal project — via a 50:50 joint venture with
Brazil's Vale — located south of Moranbah in the Bowen Basin, close to BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi
Alliance's Peak Downs mine. Eagle Downs is due to start production in 2017 at a rate of 4 million-5
million mt/year.
