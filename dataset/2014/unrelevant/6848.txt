BHP Vows to Focus on Investor Returns -- Update

ADELAIDE, Australia-- BHP Billiton Ltd. sought to reassure investors of its commitment to boosting cash
returns even amid tumbling commodity prices, as shareholders who have endured years of heavy
investments in new projects demand higher paybacks from the world's No. 1 mining company.

Still, at BHP's annual general meeting here, Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie knocked hopes of a
near-term share buyback--a move that many investors want to be a key part of its capital-management
strategy.

Resources companies world-wide, including BHP and Anglo-Australian rival Rio Tinto PLC, have taken to
shedding unwanted assets and driving downs costs to strengthen their balance sheets, in a bid to entice
investors with the promise of higher returns at the tail-end of a decadelong mining-investment boom.

BHP said it was meanwhile charging ahead with a spinoff of businesses, including aluminum and
manganese operations, into a new company that could be worth as much as US$18 billion. It hopes
the demerger will enable it to focus on large, profitable operations like copper and petroleum.

"Everything we're doing, including productivity accelerated by the demerger, is aimed at increasing cash
returns to you, our shareholders," Mr. Mackenzie told investors at the AGM on Thursday. The company
said it would hold an extraordinary general meeting in May so that shareholders could vote on the
demerger plan.

Mr. Mackenzie said a buyback of shares wasn't the top priority for his management team right now.
Speaking to reporters later, he said the key focus was to keep the company's balance sheet
strong--which included maintaining what he described as its solid A credit rating in the face of the recent
downturn in commodity prices.

"Then we look after what we think is a strong dividend, then we selectively invest in what we have for
growth, and only then if we can see excess cash might we consider that," Mr. Mackenzie added. "People
can debate that, but our priorities are in that order."
BHP said it had already returned US$64 billion to investors through dividends and buybacks over the
past decade, although it had disappointed investors in August when it failed to outline plans to repurchase
stock. UBS said recently that it didn't expect any such buyback until at least the middle of next year given
the steep commodity-price falls. Iron ore, which accounts for around half of BHP's earnings, has plunged
by close to 50% this year.

Other analysts are even more pessimistic on the chances of an imminent buyback. "Without commodity
prices going higher than expected, BHP is likely to underwhelm from a capital returns perspective,"
Christopher LaFemina, an equity analyst at U.S. brokerage Jefferies, said last month.
Global commodity markets have been roiled by a rising U.S. dollar and concern China's economy is
cooling faster than anticipated. The world's No. 2 economy has been losing momentum--with growth in
investment, factory production, exports and retail sales all slowing in October. The economy grew by
7.3% year-over-year in the third quarter, the slowest pace in more than five years.

ready for this. We have a very strong strategy of productivity, which allows us to effectively follow this
price down and look after its profitability," he told reporters.

Still, Mr. Mackenzie said he couldn't predict exactly what BHP would do with any spare cash in a
fast-moving industry where commodity prices were so volatile. He said decisions would have to be made
"in real time."
BHP isn't the only mining company promising to boost returns to investors. Last month, Rio Tinto told
shareholders that the slump in iron-ore prices wouldn't stop the company giving more cash back to
investors starting from next year.
In August, Glencore PLC said it would buy back US$1 billion of its own shares, and signaled that it was
prioritizing cash returns to shareholders over any major new investments. The Switzerland-based
resources company said it was able to do so partly because of the US$7 billion it received from selling
the Las Bambas copper mine in Peru.
BHP's chairman, Jac Nasser, said the Melbourne-based company had made good progress in recent
weeks toward plans for the demerger, which included getting regulatory approval from Australia's
foreign-investment regulator.
