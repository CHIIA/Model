Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and Australian rail haulage company Aurizon have told the shareholders
of takeover target Aquila Resources the flagship West Pilbara iron ore project risks never being built
unless they sell out their shares to the two larger companies.

In their bidders' statement lodged with the Australian Securities Exchange late Wednesday, the pair
said Aquila needed to find a further A$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion) to fund its 50% share of the potential 30
million mt/year capacity West Pilbara project. It also needed to raise another A$815 million to fund its
50% share of the Eagle Downs hard coking coal project in central Queensland's Bowen Basin region.

"As at March 31, 2014, Aquila had cash and term deposits of A$498.6 million which represents only
11% of this funding requirement," Baosteel and Aurizon said. By contrast, the two companies told
Aquila shareholders any future funding uncertainties would be removed by a sale to Baosteel and
Aurizon.

The companies pointed out that Aquila's attempts to sell stakes in other projects — including the
Washpool coking coal project in Queensland -— to fund West Pilbara had been "unsuccessful to date."
However, they did concede that Aquila had sold its Isaac Plains coal project to Japan's Sumitomo
Corp., for A$430 million in 2012, and its 24.5% interest in the Belvedere coal project to Brazil's Vale.

The bidders' statement also noted that development of the projects was "threatened by poor relations
with joint venture partners." Aquila fell out with American Metals & Coal International (AMCI), its 50%
partner in West Pilbara, which resulted in work at the project coming to a halt. It has also had several
disputes with Vale at their Queensland coal ventures.

In response to the bidders' statement, Aquila advised its shareholders to "take no action" at this stage.
The general feeling in the market in Australia is that Aquila is unlikely to sell unless the would-be suitors
raise their bid. In early May, Queensland-based Aurizon and Baosteel tabled a A$1.4 billion joint
takeover bid for Perth-based Aquila.

In a research note, Brisbane-based brokerage Morgans said if the bid succeeded, Aurizon would end
up with a 10% interest in Aquila with Baosteel holding the balance.
Eagle Downs is a 50:50 joint venture with Vale with designed hard coking coal production capacity of 4
million-5 million mt/year. Last week, South Korean steelmaker Posco — which owns 49% of AMCI,
giving it a 25% stake in the West Pilbara iron ore project — told Platts that as far as it was concerned,
its status in the project would be unaffected by any potential sale to Baosteel and Aurizon.
