*NHC: New Hope Corporation reports for the half year.

Page66of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Company guidance: On February 24 New Hope Corporation Ltd announced it expects its net profit after
tax for the first half ended January 31 to be within the range of $21/23 million (vs $68.79 mln for the
previous corresponding period).

*AGK: Seeks ruling by Aust Competition Tribunal on ACCC's MacGen veto
AGL Energy Ltd announced it has lodged an application with the Australian Competition Tribunal for
authorisation to acquire the Macquarie Generation assets in New South Wales.

This follows the announcement by the Australian Competition &^ Consumer Commission on March 4 that
it would oppose AGL's proposed acquisition of MacGen.

AGL's managing director Micahel Fraser said in the report, "The CCC's decision has significant
implications for the future of the energy industry in this country and in our view can't be left unchallenged".

In the first instance the Tribunal has a three month period to consider the application for authorisation
which may be extended by a further three months.

AGL said the time frame for decision making by the Tribunal is shorter than the time it would normally take
the Court to consider a matter of this nature. (Mar 24)

*SRX: To examine liver cancer treatment combining Lipiodol and SIR-spheres

Sirtex Medical Ltd announced a collaboration with Guerbet SA in primary and secondary (metastatic) liver
cancer. The objective is to examine how Sirtex's SIR-Spheres microspheres and Guerbet's Lipiodol may
be combined or sequenced optimally and further developed to address the significant unmet clinical need
for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic neuroendocrine
tumors and a range of other primary and secondary liver cancers.

Guerbet's Lipiodol Ultra Fluid is used in conventional trans-arterial chemo embolisation rocedures for the
tretment of patients with inoperable liver tumours.

Guerbet's CEO Dr Yves L'Epine was quoted as saying "While Lipiodol and SIR-Spheres individually are
well proven and widely used therapies in their own right, they have never been formally evaluated
together or sequentially". (Mar 24)

Flight MH370 crashed into the Indian Ocean - Inmarsat data analysis confirms

BBC News reported Inmarsat used new techniques to detect the plane's course.

Inmarsat has told the BBC it gave the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) the new data on Sunday -
stressing it needed to be checked before it was made public.

Engineers spent all weekend looking back at a previous Malaysian AirlinesBoeing 777 flights, going back
several weeks.

They compared the satellite data from those flights with flight MH370 and were able to work out it went
south, across the Indian Ocean to a remote area where there was no possibility of landing.

This is cutting-edge modelling, never tried before. It uses the Doppler effect - which is what makes a
police siren sound different from different points.

They had it reviewed by other scientists before handing it over.

As far as they can tell, the plane was flying at cruising height, above 30,000ft. They found no evidence of
fluctuating heights being reported.

They cannot pinpoint the position any further. They handed this data over on Sunday morning.
The firm said its latest calculation involved a large amount of data analysis, focusing on a number of
factors including the movements of other aircraft.
It involved an entirely new way of modelling which is why the analysis took some time, the firm said.
Inmarsat senior vice-president Chris McLaughlin said the firm had studied electronic "pings' - or bursts of
data - which the plane had sent to one of its satellites.

Page69of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.He told the BBC: "We have been dealing with a totally new area. We've been trying to help an
investigation based on a single signal once an hour from an aircraft that didn't include any GPS data, any
time and distance information".

Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said relatives of the flight's 239 passengers and crew had been
told of the "heartbreaking" news.
