ELDERS has slowed the haemorrhaging in its agribusiness operation. In its half-year financial results
released on Monday, the company reported a net loss after tax of $10.2 million for the six months to
March 31 this year, a big turnaround from the $302.2 million loss for the same corresponding period
last year.
Elders said $16.8 million in losses relating to its forestry operations and the fair value adjustment of
non-core assets now available for sale tipped an underlying profit of $6.7 million into a net after-tax
loss.

The company has now largely disposed of its forestry operations. Managing director Mark Allison said
the half-year results represented an “early milestone on the journey to becoming a value-generating
investment for its shareholders”.

“We’ve moved from incurring underlying losses to generating underlying profit and it is pleasing that
every part of the business delivered improved results despite variable seasonal conditions, which
included drought in much of north-eastern Australia,” Mr Allison said.

Traditional livestock and real estate agency operations were strong performers in the turnaround,
along with live beef cattle exports, particularly to Indonesia, and shipments of dairy heifers to
China.Elders had cut costs and reduced its net debt to $236.6 million from $314.1 million a year
earlier. The Elders share price rose 7 per cent on the news, trading at 12.2 cents a share at noon
yesterday.
