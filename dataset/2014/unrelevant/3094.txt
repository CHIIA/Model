Local shares rose over the past five sessions in spite of a stronger dollar piling pressure on exporters.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 28.8 points, or 0.5 per cent, over the past week to
5366.9, while the broader All Ordinaries Index added 0.4 per cent to 4376.8. On Friday the S&P/ASX
200 Index added 16.8 points, or 0.3 per cent, while the All Ordinaries Index gained 17 points, or 0.3 per
cent led by the big four banks.
The rise came amid some international volatility with Australia's largest trading partner China struggling
to reform its credit market and re-balance its economy without slowing growth.

"The past week has been a messy one in international markets. Economic data has been mostly
okay as hopes build for some sort of stimulus in China but Ukraine worries continue to impact," AMP
Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said.

Westpac lifted 2.4 per cent to $34.43. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank
each rose 1.9 per cent to $77.14 and $35.32 respectively. ANZ added 1.8 per cent to $32.82.
Investment Bank Macquarie Group added 5.1 per cent to $57.65 after flagging on Monday that profit for
the year ended March 31 could beat previous guidance by 45 per cent.

Resources giant BHP Billiton rose 1.6 per cent to $36.14. Main rival Rio Tinto added 3 per cent to
$63.24 despite dipping on Thursday as it was revealed the $US6 billion ($6.5 billion) Oyu Tolgoi gold
and copper project in Mongolia is likely to be delayed for another four months.

"The biggest ASX-listed resource producers are offering better value than they were a month ago due
to the concern among international investors about Chinese demand strength," Tyndall Asset
Management portfolio manager Brad Potter said.

"But bulk commodity prices are trading below consensus and if they stay around current levels much
longer analysts will likely start downgrading the big resource stocks."
Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group rose 7.1 per cent to $5.34 after opening its Kings mine, which
will lift annual iron ore production to 155 million tonnes.

In telecommunications, Telstra Corporation added 3¢ to $5.03, while TPG Telecom soared 20.5 per
cent to a record high $6.69. The discount mobile and internet provider beat analyst expectations on
Tuesday when it reported a 15 per cent rise in first-half net profit and upgraded full-year earnings
guidance, fuelling speculation it could have rival iiNet in sight as a takeover target. Premier Investments
was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 20.7 per cent to $9.61, after the retail group,
which owns brands Peter Alexander and Smiggle, beat expectations to report a 12.1 per cent rise in
first-half net profit and chairman Solomon Lew said the group could consider a major acquisition.

Information technology was the worst-performing sector, down 2.5 per cent, amid fears a sell-off in US
technology stocks is spreading to Asia.
Gold stocks were weak as the precious metal's spot price fell to $US1294.22 at Friday's local close
compared to $US1332.62 at the previous week's close, while the dollar appreciated to US92.72¢ at the
local close compared to US90.66¢ a week prior. Australia's biggest gold producer, Newcrest Mining,
fell 7.1 per cent to $9.80. Junior goldminer Medusa Mining was the worst-performing stock in the ASX
200, shedding 11.6 per cent at $1.99. According to Citibank research, US92¢ is an important tipping
point above which Australian exporters find it difficult to remain competitive.

Vaccine and drug exporter CSL was the biggest weight on the bourse, losing 1.8 per cent to $69.85.
