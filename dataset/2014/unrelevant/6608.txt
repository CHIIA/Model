ENERGY OIL and gas explorer Beach Energy has lifted its production and investment spending
forecasts.
The company says oil production volumes from the Western Flank, at the Cooper Basin in central
Australia, have been strong.

The Adelaide company had previously expected output of 8.7 million to 9.3 million barrels of oil
equivalent. It now expects that to range from 9.2 million to 9.5 million barrels.

Sales show new growth HOUSING SALES of new houses and flats have increased for the first year
since the financial crisis.

A report published by the Housing Industry Assocation shows new home sales climbed 14.4 per cent
in 2013 — the first year of growth in five years.

In the final quarter of 2013, sales nationally were at levels not seen since mid-2011, when activity in
the housing market was boosted by government stimulus programs, HIA economist Diwa Hopkins
said.

In the market for detached houses, Victoria was the weak spot in the December quarter, with sales
sliding 9.5 per cent on the previous quarter.

Google to sell Motorola TECHNOLOGY GOOGLE has signed a deal to sell its struggling smartphone
unit Motorola at a deep loss.
The technology giant announced yesterday it would sell the division to Chinese giant Lenovo for $3.3
billion.
It is a far cry from the $14.2 billionGoogle paid for the company in its biggest-ever takeover, although
it did sell off part of the Motorola business in 2012.

Google chief Larry Page said Lenovo had “the expertise and track record to scale Motorola Mobility
into a major player within the Android ecosystem’’. Motorola has failed to gain traction in a rapidly
evolving smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple.

Google announced its buyout of Motorola in 2011 and finalised the deal in 2012. While it will take a
loss on the sale, it spun off the Motorola Home division in 2012, and some of its manufacturing
facilities.

BlueScope bid backed MANUFACTURING BLUESCOPE Steel has received approval to buy one of its
competitors in the building products market.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
has decided not to oppose BlueScope’s purchase of Fielders Australia, which competes against
BlueScope’s Lysaght business. The ACCC said BlueScope’s market power in steel building products
would not be changed by the acquisition.
