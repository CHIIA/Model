Urban renewal - $2.1b development

The state government has announced plans to build 6000 new homes in North Parramatta as part of
a $2.1 billion urban renewal project.

The project will be built on a 146-hectare parcel of government-owned land between the Parramatta
River and O'Connell Street.
Over the next 15 to 20 years, apartment blocks as high as 30 storeys will be built on the site, which
is home to a cluster of heritage buildings.

NSW Premier and Minister for Western Sydney Mike Baird said: "The Parramatta North precinct is
home to some of the state's - and indeed Australia's - most important heritage locations and assets,
including Australia's first farm and first water mill, Parramatta Female Factory and the Old Kings
School."
Mr Baird declared North Parramatta a "state significant site", which will allow "fast-tracking the
delivery of thousands of new homes and jobs, providing a major economic boost for western
Sydney".

It is understood that the government will sell off building sites to private developers who will have to
operate within the parameters of a development control plan.

Mr Baird said that heritage experts will guide the government to "ensure that the most significant
buildings are preserved" and assist in finding "appropriate adaptive reuse for these buildings".

The facilities at Cumberland Hospital will eventually be vacated but it has not been announced when
this will occur. The development will also include improvements to local parklands.
Bronwyn Evans, who leads a group concerned about the impact of the WestConnex motorway on
traffic around Wentworth Point, is concerned about traffic congestion around Parramatta due to the
influx of new residents.

"The government needs to adopt a much more holistic planning approach rather than just a
knee-jerk plan, 'Let's do some houses'," she said. "There's no infrastructure in the whole
Homebush-Parramatta area so it's a really big deal. They think the WestConnex is going to solve
everything and it's just not."
When asked about the potential impact on property prices, the chief executive of Starr Partners,
Douglas Driscoll, said despite the huge number of homes in the pipeline, the project was unlikely to
depress property prices.

"With big projects like this there is the risk that it will dilute prices," he said. "But the demand for
Parramatta is so high that I think prices will remain in line with growth in the area."

were to investors. And the fact that the 6000 residences in the pipeline are new homes means they
can be purchased by offshore buyers.

"A very large percentage of those properties will be bought by overseas investors, primarily from
mainland China," Mr Driscoll said.
A building boom is under way in Parramatta with $8 billion worth of residential and commercial
development in the pipeline. Further down the Parramatta River, developer Starryland Australia is
building 774 apartments for its Promenade development.
