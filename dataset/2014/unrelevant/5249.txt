CHINESE developer Ausbao is moving to redevelop a 12-storey Sydney office block it bought last
year for $55 million.

Ausbao, a subsidiary of Beijing Capital Development Holdings, has lodged a development application
for a 26-storey mixed-use development on the site fronting 286 Sussex Street in the CBD.

If approved, the $75m development would include 22 floors of apartments and a further two floors of
retail space. There would also be four levels of basement parking.
The company bought the 1337sq m corner site last November in a deal brokered by John Bowie
Wilson of Knight Frank and James Aroney of JLL.
Ausbao paid nearly double for the building than what it was worth two years before the sale.

Recent research by JLL found Asian developers leading a shift in CBD developments away from
office space to residential.

The research estimated 178,583sq m of office stock in Sydney could become apartments, with strong
demand for city dwellings creating a 43,400 dwelling shortfall in supply.The development application
comes as Ausbao reaches the final stages of the development of the $280m The Quay project, a
270-apartment property on the corner of Quay Street and Ultimo Road.
