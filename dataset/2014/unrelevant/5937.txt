A quiet start to the week with some buying emerging following an early 20 point sell off. At times we went
positive and support is building around the 5570 level before an assault on 5600 to come.In the end we
closed down up 7 at 5577 after a fade at the close.Financials were a tad weaker as doubts continue to
emerge on the growth prospects going forward. #NAB# shrugged off the slightly negative vibe after
announcing a deal in the UK to sell some underperforming loans. #MQG# continued to feel the wrath of
the market following last weeks update and look to test support around the mid 57's.

Resources fared better led by #FMG# and #NCM# while #SIR# put in a blinder bouncing back from the
placement last week as did #LYC# and #SYR#. In the industrials things were a little mixed with #TLS#
having a bad day for a change ,#BXB# slipped on global growth concerns, but #WOW# and #WES# were
outdone by #MTS# today. Retailers were mixed #MYR# attracting some punters but #JBH# in the
dumps.Building stocks fell today led by #CSR#,#BLD# and #JHX#. Taking out Gold today included a raft
of gold stocks as the shiny stuff went higher #PIR#,#NST#,#EVN#,#OGC# to name a few whilst #WAM#
bam thank you mam enjoyed a spurt on record profits at the expense of other wealth managers like
#MFG# and #BTT#. Missing out on the medals were #MSB#,#NVT#,#IPL#,#MRM# and #BYE# indeed
following somewhat disappointing drill results in Louisiana.
Asian markets were significantly better as China bounds ahead up 2.6% today with HK up 1% and Tokyo
up 0.4%. Seems that the Chinese market is playing a little catch up to the rest of the world given that
strong PMI number last week. Chinese industrial-company profits jumped the most last month since
September and P/Es look pretty cheap compared to their expensive US and Australian counterparts.
Easy to see the attraction given that Chinese shares in Hong Kong trade at 7.7 times estimated
earnings, compared with the S&P 500 at 16.6 times.

Volume was again pretty horrible at around $2.8bn, including new float Healthscope, while the new bull in
the China shop is showing a clean pair of hooves with 170% of its 30 day average volume.Seems that is
where the action is at the moment .The Aussie dollar continues to track around 94c like Icarus to the sun.
Gold at $1304 and the digital tulips $622.

Stocks and Stories
The Government has approved the Adani coal and rail project from the Galilee Basin to much gnashing of
teeth from environmentalists. Still King Clive will be happy too!
Recent oil and gas hopeful #TPT# suffered a set back following no significant hydrocarbons found in the
secondary target for their Moroccan drill campaign. The primary target still to be reached ,but placement
stock finding its way onto the market on this disappointment.

#NVT# full year profit has fallen 31 per cent after writedowns to its university division overshadowed
stronger revenues. Navitas made a net profit of $51.58 million for the 2013/14 financial year,down from
$74.6 million a year ago. The biggest issue of the year cam on today with debutante

#HSO# opening better than the $2.10 issue price and in moderately strong volume with a good push into
the close helping considerably. Stags will be happy and no one can accuse the private equity boys of
selling anything too cheap. Suspect this is a slow burn story as the sellers dry up in the next few days.

Global Investment for slightly above book value there by reducing their loan exposure. Recent numbers
from RBS in the UK suggest things are getting better for UK banks.

#LEI# reversed Friday's good gains with the profit announcement today from 70% Spanish owned
Leighton. It has suffered a 20 per cent slide in first half profit after write-downs and restructuring costs
offset an increase in revenue. The company made a net profit of $291 million for the six months to June
30, down from $366 million a year ago.

High flyer #LNG# was halted today pending a capital raising as they have bought the Bear Head LNG
project in Canada for $11m.
#REA# came calling today and have bought out a big stake in Asian wannabe #IPP# 18% was bought
from the French SeLoger group at a $3.40 price.
Not sure if this is really a win for shareholders but the great fridge giveaway (ok, its $200) but "buy a six
pack of Penfolds wine and you get something to keep it in" looks to be killing it.12,000 so far been
ordered which is helping the new CEO see off the private equity bid. Of course it will take more than a
few fridges to get this one out of the doldrums if the bid wasn't a possibility but it all helps.

Tomorrow's News Today

Here's an invention that could really change the world. Not a new phone or music device (or a social
media platform enabling pictures to be sent of cats, dogs and food) but a USB stick that allows DNA to be
analysed in 30 minutes and to check for genetic disorders. Now that is quite something. Invented by a
Greek Cypriot inventor called Christofer Toumazou.You will hear a lot more on this.

Since the US discovered Fracking they seem to have lost interest in the Middle East. Gaza, Iraq, Syria
and now Libya once again at each other's throats. Not to mention Egypt!

Looks like the Argentinean default is back on the agenda again.

UK quoted companies issued 137 profit warnings in the first six months of the year, up 9% on the first half
of 2013

Only 40% of Germans own their own homes.

Not long to go before Scotland votes to leave the United Kingdom. Judging by the success of the Scots in
the games in Glasgow, nationalistic pride will surge them over the Yes line in September. Could get very
interesting for the UK from there.If they can leave the UK maybe the UK will leave Europe?

That is all
