0108 GMT [Dow Jones] Macquarie Group's (MQG.AU) leverage to improving capital market conditions
is a key attraction for Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts. They retain a buy rating and A$64.05
target price, with Macquarie their preferred choice in the diversified financial sector. "While fixed interest
currencies and commodities trends to date are relatively flat, potential near-term catalysts that warrant
ongoing attention include escalating geopolitical tensions creating more global oil price volatility, a
pick-up in dry bulk freight activity, and a dramatic improvement in the environment for impairments."
MQG last up 0.8% at A$60.82. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0041 GMT [Dow Jones] The New Zealand National party will be able to form a government after the
country's election on Sep. 20, a 3 News Reid Research poll shows, with the governing party and its
coalition partners having sufficient support. The poll shows that National holds 49.7% of the vote while
the largest opposition party Labour holds 27.3% of the vote. The Green party -- likely coalition party with
Labour -- has 12.7% support. A party must hold 51% -- currently there are 121 seats in Parliament -- to
win an outright majority. Since a proportional representative system was introduced in 1996, no party
has ruled alone and small parties at times have wielded considerable clout.

0032 GMT [Dow Jones] Thermal-coal prices ease as traders digest "poor winter demand forecasts for
key Asian markets, plenty of supply availability and very limited-to-nil ship queues at Newcastle," says
Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Lachlan Shaw. Australia's thermal-coal industry continues to
face challenging conditions after a prolonged slump in prices for the fuel, he says. At current prices and
exchange rates, around 40% of Australian export supply is either unprofitable, or on the borderline of
being unprofitable, Shaw says. Thermal coal at Australia's Newcastle port Thursday traded down 0.1%
at US$70.60/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

0029 GMT [Dow Jones] An improvement in Japan's jobs-to-applicants ratio and unemployment rate will
add pressure on firms to raise wages to attract workers, says Junichi Makino, economist at SMBC Nikko
Securities. "That's good for households, and will also help add to inflation," as companies have to raise
prices to account for higher wages, he says, adding that wage data due next week for May will likely
already show an increase in pay. Makino calculates that there are about 1 million workers that can still
be incorporated into the workforce and "companies will only be able to attract those workers with higher
wages." Japan's jobs-to-applicants ratio rises to 1.09 in May, the highest in nearly 22 years, and the
unemployment rate falls to 3.5%, the lowest since 1997. (eleanor.warnock@wsj.com)
2306 GMT [Dow Jones] New Zealand's trade surplus narrows to NZ$285 million in May and totals
NZ$1.37 billion for the year ended May, Statistics New Zealand says. The annual surplus was the
highest since November 2010. May's surplus was once again powered by exports to China, which rose
NZ$204 million to NZ$868 million; exports to Australia dipped NZ$81 million. Exports to China were
led by milk powder, crude oil and sheepmeat. Total exports in May were NZ$4.6 billion, up 13% on the
year and up 4% on the month. Total imports in May were NZ$4.3 billion, up 7.0% on the year and up

the growth in exports seen in the past year has leveled off." (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

2243 GMT [Dow Jones]--Port of Tauranga's (POT.NZ) target price has been upgraded to NZ$16.30 from
NZ$15.55 by Credit Suisse, although it maintains a neutral rating on the company. Port of Tauranga is
currently trading up 0.3% to $15.04. It says in a note that news of concurrent alliances formed between
Port of Tauranga and Kotahi and Maersk should "ultimately deliver meaningful port and shipping cost
efficiency across the supply chain from the deployment of larger capacity vessels by shipping lines." It
adds that the potential reversion of some container volumes to Ports of Auckland following the end of
strike action, along with lower forecast log export volumes might to lead to a lowering of short-term
earnings forecasts. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com)

17:45 EDT - When a small bond deal was announced Thursday, the debt grade came from an unfamiliar
name: HR Ratings. The issuance of $31M in education-revenue bonds were given a BBB-, representing
the first-ever US rating for HR Ratings, a Mexico City-based firm. In November 2012, HR Ratings
became the 10th credit-rating company to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Despite SEC efforts to increase rating-world competition, the biggest three firms--Standard & Poor's,
Moody's and Fitch--still dominate market share. Only a few new players have emerged. HR Ratings says
it's the first Latin American ratings firm to issue a debt grade in the US. (timothy.martin@wsj.com;

17:06 EDT - Alcoa (AA) seems to have given up on its attempts to shrink its debt burden. The aluminum
maker announced it's buying of jet-engine parts maker Firth Rixson today for $2.85B, most of which will
be financed with borrowed cash. Credit research firm Gimme Credit says that the debt financing needed
to complete the deal will push up Alcoa's debt-to-Ebitda ratio to nearly 4 times, up from "an already too
high 3 times." That likely means AA's management is willing to live with its junk credit rating. AA lost its
investment-grade rating in the spring of last year, and was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in September. (vipal.monga@wsj.com; @vipalmonga)

16:57 EDT - Morgan Stanley says it's argued in the past that Canada exhibited many of the traditional
symptoms of "Dutch Disease," which happens when a country's currency is boosted by strong demand
for its commodities, and that currency strength chokes off exports. The symptoms are overdependence
on commodity exports, underinvestment in manufacturing, and a high real effective exchange rate based
on high unit labor costs. The one symptom missing ingredient was inflation, Morgan Stanley says. "Now
that this has emerged, our conviction that the long-term fundamentals for Canada are bearish has only
risen," it says. (don.curren@wsj.com; @dbcurren)

16:29 EDT - The Canadian dollar has pulled off a significant rally since early June, but Morgan Stanley
calls it a "bad rally" given that the drivers of growth in Canada are unsustainable, and that low
productivity and growth will weigh on real interest rates and foreign investment. Firm notes the Bank of
Canada has said the "fundamental drivers of growth and inflation in Canada...hinge critically on the
projected upturn in exports and investment," and points out Canada is becoming more dependent on
commodity exports just as its main trading partner, the US, is increasingly sourcing energy internally.
Firm says it'll look for opportunities to establish bearish medium-term positions in CAD in the coming
months. USD/CAD down 0.25% to 1.0692. (don.curren@wsj.com; @dbcurren)

16:15 EDT - NZD/USD remains in favor and "with US data overnight giving little reason to bid the USD
higher, those looking for a higher NZD likely still maintain the upper hand in the near term," says BNZ FX
Strategist Raiko Shareef. The pair is at 0.8775 early in New Zealand and if it manages to push through
0.8780, the three-year high of around 0.8840 beckons, he says. On the downside, support will become
apparent around the 0.8700 mark, he says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

14:11 EDT - This week's rally has sent the 10-year yield close to the 2014 low of 2.4% set in late May.
Mary Ann Hurley, trader at D.A. Davidson, says the yield could test the trough again, though "US growth
would have to slow appreciably more than what it is." Still, she notes that this year, foreign buyers have
piled into Treasurys due to their superior yields compared to German and Japanese bonds. "Interest
rates are so much higher here than in other global countries, so buyers may emerge even if growth does
not slow from these levels," she says. Ten-year notes up 8/32, yielding 2.530%. (min.zeng@wsj.com)
