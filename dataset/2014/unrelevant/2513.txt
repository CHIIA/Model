INTERNATIONAL groups are charging into Sydney’s suburban property markets, with
Chinese-based giant Fosun International circling a North Sydney office building being offloaded by
Investa Property Group for nearly $120 million.

The 11-level tower, at 73 Miller Street, will be occupied by the NSW government for a further five
years and is mooted as a potential redevelopment play when the lease expires. The Shanghai-based
Fosun is said to be the frontrunner to buy the tower, although a deal has not yet been done.

Investa, Fosun and the agents on the building, Knight Frank’s James Parry, Tyler Talbot, Dominic Ong
and Neil Brookes, declined to comment yesterday.
Fosun, led by China rich listers Guo Guangchang and Liang Xinjun, was founded in 1992 and has
grown into one of China’s largest companies with a market capitalisation of more than $US8 billion in
May, according to Forbes.
The conglomerate has a property empire spanning Asia, the US and Europe. It also has a presence
in manufacturing, mining and insurance. The group has been eyeing an entry into the Australian
market for most of the year. It was one of the highest bidders on a Sydney CBD tower at 201
Elizabeth Street, which was placed on the market by its owners Dexus Property Group and Perron
group before eventually being withdrawn.
In Sydney’s suburbs, NSW government body Sydney Water has sold a development site at inner-city
Waterloo for a purported $80m. An offshore group is tipped to be the buyer.
The site can hold 439 residential apartments, as well as retail, community and commercial space. It
is close to the Green Square precinct, where Mirvac and the government plan to build about 2000
apartments, up to 14,000sq m of retail space and about 50,000sq m of office space.
The NSW government and the agent handling the sale Stonebridge Property Group’s Lincoln
Blackledge, declined to comment.
Also in Waterloo, little known Chinese-based property group Shanghai Minhang Real Estate
Development has emerged as the buyer of an industrial property with future residential development
potential.
The group bought the property, at 1029-1035 Bourke Road, 723 Elizabeth Street and 409 George
Street, last month for $46m, in a deal handled by JLL’s Sam Brewer and Colliers International’s
Michael Crombie.
A spokesman for the group said it liked the fact it was 200m from Green Square station. He said that
the company had purchased two other Sydney suburban sites, at Elizabeth Bay and Eastwood,
although he would not release any details.CBRE chairman of residential projects Justin Brown said
that the rise of international groups had increased the competition for large Sydney sites.
