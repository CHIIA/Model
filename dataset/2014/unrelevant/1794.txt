Australia’s largest dairy company Devondale Murray Goulburn posted record high sales, revenue,
farmgate milk price and milk supply growth in 2013-14.
The full-year results also revealed a $36 million windfall from the sale of Warrnambool Cheese and
Butter shares when they were sold after a failed takeover bid.

Murray Goulburn achieved record sales revenue of $2.917 billion, up 22 per cent on the previous year,
a 37 per cent increase in the farmgate milk price to $6.81/kg milk solids, and an eight per cent rise in
milk intake that totalled 3.4 billion litres.
Murray Goulburn’s share of Australia’s milk pool rose to 37 per cent, up from 33 per cent, and net profit
after tax was $29.3 million.
Managing director Gary Helou said international dairy food prices were at high levels during 2013-14,
underpinned by strong demand from Asia and the Middle East.

‘‘Our focus on the value growth segments of nutritional powders and international consumer and
food-service dairy food exports, combined with the robust growth in MG’s milk supply, helped MG
deliver an exceptionally strong year,’’ he said.
Mr Helou said the focus would remain on driving efficiency in the business and value adding with two
daily pasteurised milk plants coming on line plus an additional $127 million capital expenditure
approved to bolster capabilities in consumer cheese and dairy beverages.
‘‘Long-term underlying dairy foods demand from Asia remains strong with a net reliability on imports to
satisfy the ongoing growth in per capita consumption,’’ he said.
‘‘However, international dairy prices have declined significantly from last year’s historic highs mainly
due to production growth in exporting countries, namely New Zealand and the European Union, and the
compounding impact of high inventories in China and the recent Russian trade ban.’’

Mr Helou said he expected some recovery in international pricing, but it was difficult to predict the timing
and strength of any change.
