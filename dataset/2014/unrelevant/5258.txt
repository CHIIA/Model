Investment firm Allan Gray Australia, the biggest shareholder in Australian independent ROC Oil with
an 18.9% share, has accepted a recommended cash offer for ROC from private Chinese
companyFosun International, ROC said Friday.

If completed, the deal will mark the first takeover of an Australian oil company by a private Chinese
firm.
Shares in Fosun -- a diversified financial services and industrial holding with no previous oil industry
exposure -- are listed in Hong Kong, although the company's founder and chairman still owns 58% of
the stock.
Fosun in August made a A$474 million ($417 million) cash takeover offer for ROC, interrupting the
company's plans for a merger with fellow Australian upstream player Horizon Oil.
Sydney-based Allan Gray opposed ROC's attempt to merge with Horizon, mainly because it would have
left ROC with a 42% share of the new company.

ROC said that with Allan Gray's approval, shareholder acceptances for Fosun's offer had topped 29%.
Australia-based ROC has extensive upstream interest in the Bohai Bay and Beibu Gulf offshore China.
Last month the company announced a new oil find, with partner Horizon, on Beibu Gulf Block 22/12.
