[[ Press Release Thun, 17 September 2014 "NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION, CIRCULATION OR
DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, HONG KONG OR JAPAN OR ANY
JURISDICTION INTO WHICH THE SAME WOULD BE UNLAWFUL." Meyer Burger Technology Ltd
launches CHF senior convertible bond issue Meyer Burger Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: MBTN)
announces today the launch of an offering of up to CHF 100 million senior unsecured convertible bonds
due 2020 (the "Convertible Bonds"), with an investor put option in 2018. So far this year, the Company
has made substantial investments into working capital as presented in the half year results.

In the months July and August 2014, the trend of the run rate in "usual business" orders continued to show
a similar pattern as in the first half-year period of 2014, with a strong improvement (+146%) over "usual
business" orders for the comparable two months period in 2013 (+13% considering total incoming orders
including large orders received in July/August 2013). In order to have the required resources at hand to
cope with future market developments and taking advantage of current capital market conditions, the
Company decided to proactively raise additional long-term funds. The proceeds from the offering will
mainly be used for funding of potential working capital requirements, investments in demo equipment and
general corporate purposes. The Convertible Bonds are expected to carry a coupon of between 3.5% and
4.5% per annum, payable annually in arrears and have a conversion price set at a premium of between
25% and 30% over the volume weighted average price of the shares between the announcement and
pricing of the Convertible Bonds today. The final terms of the Convertible Bonds will be determined
through an institutional bookbuilding process and are expected to be announced later today after the
conclusion of the bookbuilding. The Convertible Bonds will be issued at 100% of the principal amount
and, unless previously redeemed, converted or repurchased and cancelled, will mature on 24 September
2020 at 100% of their principal amount. The bonds carry an investor put option after four years, i.e. on 24
September 2018. The bonds will be convertible into up to 8.8 million registered shares of Meyer Burger
Technology Ltd, representing up to 9.8% of the current outstanding share capital of Meyer Burger
Technology Ltd (the "Shares"). The Shares to be delivered upon conversion shall be sourced from
conditional capital and/or from the existing authorised capital. Subject to the resolution of the Annual
Shareholders' Meeting in April 2015, the Board of Directors plans to increase conditional capital by such
amount required to satisfy all conversion rights attached to the Convertible Bonds by delivery of Shares
solely out of conditional capital[1] (#_ftn1). The pre-emptive rights of the shareholders to subscribe the
convertible bonds have been excluded for this offering. Application will be made for the Convertible
Bonds to be admitted for listing and trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange, with provisional trading expected
to start on or around 23 September 2014. Payment and settlement of the Convertible Bonds is expected
to be on or around 24 September 2014. The offering consists of a public offering in Switzerland and
private placements in certain jurisdictions outside of Switzerland and the United States in reliance on
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in accordance with applicable
securities laws, rules and regulations. Credit Suisse and UBS are acting as Joint Bookrunners on the
Convertible Bond offering. ------------------------------------------------ [1] (#_ftnref1) The current Articles of
Association contain conditional capital of up to 4 million shares that can be issued in conjunction with
convertible bonds, bonds with option rights or similar financial market instruments, as well as authorised
capital of up to 4.8 million shares. For further information: Analysts / Investors Michel Hirschi Chief
