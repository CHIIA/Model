6 November 2014 - Australian engineering services firmUGL Ltd (ASX:UGL) has wrapped up the sale of
its property services unit DTZ to private investment consortium comprising US private equity firmTPG
Capital, Hong Kong’s PAG Asia Capital and Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan

Announcing the agreement in June, UGL has said it would shed the unit for an enterprise value of
AUD1.2bn (USD1bn/EUR835.5m).

As a result of the transaction, DTZ will retain its brand, operating as an independent privately-owned

real estate firmCassidy Turley Inc, which is itself being acquired by DTZ Investment Holdings. The latter
is backed by the consortium of TPG Capital LP, PAG Asia Capital and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension
Plan.

UGL anticipated the divestment of DTZ to bring net proceeds of between AUD1bn and AUD1.05bn, the
