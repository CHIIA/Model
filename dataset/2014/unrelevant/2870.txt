Toga Far East Hotels – founded by the Sydney-based Vidor family and backed by Singapore's
cashed-up Far East Hospitality Group – is buying a grand, heritage-listed building opposite Brisbane's
Treasury Casino.
Toga Group amassed 57 hotels before recently signing a 50-50 joint venture with Far East. The group
is to purchase the building at 171 George Street from a private company based in the West Indies.
The price has been withheld. However, the vendors paid $20.3 million for the building in 2003 and
industry sources indicated the property would likely sell for between $35 million and $40 million. The
palatial former Family Services building will be converted from offices to a hotel, with further storeys to
be added.

It is understood that Ray White Transact's Rick Bird and Andrew Adnam of Ray White Commercial
were involved in the deal, but neither was available for comment.
It's the second acquisition of a city office block for hotel conversion by TFE Hotels in less than a
month.
In June, the group acquired a 13-level office property on the corner of George and Hunter streets in
the Sydney CBD for $50 million .
The drive by TFE Hotels to expand its hotel portfolio is part of a national hotel development explosion.
JLL Hotels reported this year that the pipeline of new hotel projects was at a decade high, with more
than 50 projects under construction or mooted, delivering an extra 7000 rooms and a host of new
brands over the next five years.

Brisbane is leading the charge, with 14 projects (1702 rooms) under construction or proposed between
now and 2016 that will dramatically increase the size of the market. Asian developers are active
alongside local players such as Mantra and Alpha Hotels. Singapore's SilverNeedle Hospitality will
open a 300-room NEXT Hotel this year.
Hong Kong hotel group Ovolo has signalled plans to expand into Brisbane.
