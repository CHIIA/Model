comfortably at its record low for the foreseeable future. The cash rate has been at 2.5 per cent since
August last year and doesn’t look likely to be moving any time soon, with many economists expecting
the Reserve Bank to keep it on hold for the rest of the year. Mortgage Choice spokesperson Jessica
Darnbrough said people were now drifting back to variable loans after a jump in fixed-rate mortgages
last year.

economic growth. Asciano shares outperformed the market yesterday, dropping only half a cent to
$5.395.
