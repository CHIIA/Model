THE price of iron ore has slipped below tf $US100 a tonne for the first time in nearly two years, and
mining chiefs say they would continue to focus on driving down costs.
Iron ore, measured out of the Tianjin port in China, lost a further 2.2 per cent overnight on Monday.

It slid to $US98.50 a tonne, its lowest point since September 2012.

The bulk metal has slumped 6.6 per cent in May and has pushed deeper into bear-market territory,
down 26.6 per cent for the year.
Following iron ore’s slide this year, Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has seen his company’s
share price and personal fortune tumble.
At Fortescue’s peak of $6.23 this year, Mr Forrest’s fortune was worth $6.43 billion.
Since then, Fortescue’s share price has plunged 26.8 per cent to $4.39, wiping $1.91 billion from
Mr Forrest’s stake.
A $US10 movement in the iron price translates to a $US2.1 billion difference to Rio Tinto’s bottom
line, and $US1.2 billion for BHP Billiton, which is roughly half as exposed as its rival,according to
Credit Suisse figures for next year.
Diversified miners are ramping up iron ore production, while single-metal miners continue to add to
supply, leading to oversupply and a further price slump.
Managing director of Grange Resources, Wayne Bould, said iron ore prices were at “pretty
unsatisfactory” levels, and he had witnessed a major effort from buyers to push iron pellet prices
lower this year.
“Normally there is a reasonable premium offered for the pellet products we sell into China but there
has been an extremely large amount of pressure pushing that premium lower,” he said.
Grange requires a long-term average iron ore price in the low $US80-a-tonne range, and given it
still has more than $100 million of cash in the bank, Mr Bould was confident his company could
still be profitable at current levels.

He is studying low-cost ways to develop the Southdown project in Western Australia and said
Grange would cut its cloth to suit whatever price was necessary for that project.
Australia is expected to export 687 million tonnes of the raw material this year.
