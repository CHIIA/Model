NZ WELLINGTON, June 25 BusinessDesk - Shares in Gentrack Group, which develops utilities and
airports software, have debuted at $NZ2.58 on the NZX - up 7.5 per cent from their initial public offering
price.
The company raised $NZ36 million ($A33.51 million) of new capital that will be used to repay debt
taken on for its management buyout in 2014 and to cover IPO costs.

At the same time, shareholders including chairman John Clifford and executive director James Docking
raised about $NZ63m selling existing shares.
After the sale, existing investors hold about 43.2 per cent of Gentrack.

But by early afternoon on Wednesday, the stock had shed most of its initial gains to be at $NZ2.48.

The listing comes at a rocky time for companies looking to go public.

Hirepool on Tuesday abandoned plans for what would have been the year's second-biggest IPO on the
NZX as investors baulked at the offer, while Serko slumped in its first day of trading, recovering
somewhat on Wednesday to trade at $NZ1.04 compared to an IPO price of $NZ1.10.

Mobile measuring device maker ikeGPS and Scales Corp, the fruit and vegetables logistics group, both
have prospectuses in the market and there's talk that MetroGlass, Orion Health, Vista Entertainment
Solutions and Eroad are considering going public.
Auckland-based Gentrack counts Genesis Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, Australia's
Origin Energy and the UK's SembCorp Bournemouth Water among the electricity and water utility
customers for its Gentrack Velocity billing product.

Airport companies that use its Airport 20/20 management system include Auckland International Airport,
Sydney Airport, Hong Kong International Airport and John F Kennedy International Airport.
The company competes with SAP and Oracle for utility billing systems and with Lockheed Martin, SITA
and AirIT for airport systems, according to its prospectus.
Given the share sale will leave Gentrack debt free, with a strong balance sheet, it has said it would
consider acquisitions of up to $NZ20m to add compatible software or enter new markets.
