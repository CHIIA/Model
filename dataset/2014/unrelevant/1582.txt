Local shares slid as Australia's balance of trade posted a deficit and the most recent survey of activity
in the Chinese services sector disappointed.

Global investors were waiting on the European Central Bank to detail stimulus measures.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2 per cent on Thursday to 5436.9, while the broader All
Ordinaries Index dipped 0.1 per cent to 5419.7, as falls in the biggest banks outweighed a pick-up in
the biggest miners following a surprise rebound in the iron ore price. The ASX has declined in five out
of the past six sessions.
Shares fell in early trade after taking a muted lead from offshore. Equity markets in the United States
edged modestly higher on Wednesday while London's FTSE and the FTSE EuroTop 100 Index edged
lower ahead of rates announcements from both the ECB and the Bank of England on Thursday night
Australian time. The BoE is expected to leave rates unchanged but the ECB announcement may
prove an important market catalyst.

"President Mario Draghi has made very clear the ECB  will take some action to stimulate the euro
zone economy, but the implication for global markets will depend on how big and broad the stimulus
is," Contango Asset Management portfolio manager Shawn Burns said. "However, we expect the
benefits to be largely contained to European markets."
In China, the HSBC/Markit services purchasing managers index for May showed activity in the sector
at a four-month low of 50.7, worse than recent official data had indicated.

In local economic news, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed April's trade balance
unexpectedly swung into a small deficit.

However, many economists said April's deficit will probably be temporary. "With the transition from
mining investment to production still under way, the trade balance should swing back to surplus in
coming months," St George Bank senior economist Janu Chan said.

Losses among Telstra and the big four banks dragged the index lower. Commonwealth Bank of
Australia fell 0.3 per cent to $80.95, Westpac Banking Corporation 0.4 per cent to $34.20, ANZ
Banking Group 0.5 per cent to $33.23, and National Australia Bank 0.2 per cent to $33.23. Telstra
Corporation lost 0.4 per cent to $5.30.
Mining was the best-performing sector, up 0.2 per cent, with the biggest producers getting a boost as
the spot price for iron ore landed in China lifted 2.2 per cent to $US94.60 a tonne. It was the biggest
daily rise since March 31.
Rio Tinto, the biggest exporter of iron ore, rose 0.4 per cent to $59.65, while iron ore miner
Fortescue Metals Group lifted 4.3 per cent to $4.65. Resources giant BHP Billiton added 0.1 per cent
to $36.20, as it announced 100 job cuts from its iron ore division.

inventory clearing in May," Mr Burns said.

Food and liquor was the worst-performing sector, down 0.6 per cent as Woolworths lost 0.2 per cent
to $36.94, while Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, dropped 0.8 per cent to $42.40.
Offshore oil and gas industry engineering services provider Mermaid Marine was the best-performing
stock in the ASX 200, climbing 5 per cent to $2.10, as it completed a $550 million acquisition of
Jaya Holdings, adding 27 vessels to its fleet.

Cinema and theme park operator Village Roadshow was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200,
dropping 8.2 per cent to $7.25 as it announced a 15¢-per-share fully franked special dividend. iSentia
Group, formerly Media Monitors, surged 19.1 per cent to $2.43 on its ASX debut, further fuelling
optimism about the market for more initial public offerings this quarter.
