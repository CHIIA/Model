Singapore's Global Logistic Properties Ltd. has grown its global fund management platform to US$13.2
billion of AUM with expansions in Japan and Brazil.

GLP expanded its 50/50 GLP Japan Development Venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
in a move that increases the venture's total size by 29% to US$2.2 billion.

Each partner will contribute an additional ¥15 billion of equity in the venture. The investment identification
period has been reset for a further three years.

Meanwhile, GLP took two initiatives in Brazil that boosted its fund-management platform in the country by
68% to US$3.7 billion.

Together with the CPPIB and an unnamed North American institutional investor, the logistics developer
formed GLP Brazil Income Partners II, which holds about 896,000 square meters of logistics assets
located mainly in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
It also expanded GLP Brazil Development Partners I, jointly owned by the company, CPPIB and
Singapore's GIC, by 36%, or US$400 million, to 3.6 billion reais, with the additional capital to be deployed
in a Rio de Janeiro site of 350,000-square-meter buildable area.

* Japanese heavyweight Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd.'s net income for the fiscal second quarter surged
22.5% year over year to ¥53.44 billion from ¥43.63 billion. It expects a 6.7% drop in fiscal 2015 net
income to ¥60 billion.

* Over in Singapore CapitaCommercial Trust reported distribution income of S$61.6 million for the third
quarter, an increase of 4.8% from the S$58.8 million in the year-ago period. It will pay out an estimated
distribution per unit of 2.10 cents for the quarter.
* Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust reported a 1.6% year-over-year rise in its second-quarter
distribution income totaling S$87.8 million. Distribution per unit for the quarter came in at 3.66 cents.

stapled security to 12.3 cents per stapled security and distribution guidance range of 9.2 cents to 9.4
cents per stapled security.
The group is also forging ahead with apartment and housing projects and will release 2,700 residential
lots in financial 2015.
* Goodman Group in its fiscal first-quarter update reaffirmed its fiscal 2015 forecast that calls for
operating EPS of 36.9 Australian cents, up 6% on fiscal 2014. The company said it is "well-positioned to
continue benefitting from the robust global capital market conditions and ongoing demand for prime
industrial space."

* Stockland said it is on track to achieve EPS growth in fiscal 2015 of 6.0% to 7.5% above fiscal 2014,
assuming no material change in market conditions.

Moneyball

* Speaking of Stockland, the Australian developer has priced a €300 million seven-year green bond under
its euro medium-term note program, becoming the country's first issuer to sell bonds funding
environmentally sustainable projects. This issuance will extend Stockland's pro forma weighted average
debt maturity to 5.8 years and reduces its weighted average cost of debt to about 6.4% from about 6.5%.
The company said this week that it is launching a significant new master planned community in the
Wyndham growth corridor west of Melbourne, with an end value of A$637 million. The project will provide
more than 2,500 new homes.
* Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd., which has the two biggest single dollar bonds outstanding in
China's property sector, is planning to sell five-year notes by late December to refinance one of them,
Bloomberg News reported, citing CreditSights Inc. The company has to repay $1.35 billion of the 13%
notes in January 2015.
* Compatriot Agile Property Holdings Ltd., which had to scrap its rights issue earlier with its chairman in
custody, obtained a much-needed 12-month extension to repay what remains of a US$475 million loan
due in December. Banks including HSBC have agreed to give Agile an extra 12 months to pay back up to
$265 million of the $475 million loan facility. The remaining $210 million of the loans outstanding will be
repaid from the net proceeds of the developer's proposed HK$1.65 billion rights issue announced Oct. 15.
* Chinese real estate companies have been running up debt amid a market slowdown, according to The
Financial Times (London). The average net gearing in the sector is expected to jump to 82% by year-end
from 73% in 2013, the publication said, citing estimates from Barclays.

Rumor mill
GPT Group and DEXUS Property Group are said to have held merger talks about 18 months to two
years ago to form a "property powerhouse" with about A$25 billion in AUM, The Australian reported. The
discussions took place during the period before the two groups commenced bidding for the takeover of the
Commonwealth Property Office Fund, the news outlet added, citing sources. The plan was mothballed
partly due to concerns over key management personnel movement during the period between the merger
announcement and an uncertain shareholder sign-off.

Other news

* As major Japanese realtors step up development efforts ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games, Mitsui
Fudosan Co. Ltd. is pouring about ¥320 billion into several redevelopment projects in central Tokyo, The
Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing President Masanobu Komoda.

* One of Japan's biggest conglomerates, Mitsui & Co. Ltd., is looking beyond its home country to Thailand.
The company plans to invest ¥1.5 billion in Thailand logistics REIT business. The investment includes a
30% stake acquisition in a REIT manager of local industrial site developer Ticon REIT for 70 million Thai
baht. Ticon REIT is expected to be listed as a logistics REIT within the year. Mitsui expects to grow the
trust's assets to about 20 billion baht in three to five years from the current range of 4 billion baht to 5
billion baht.
* India eased rules for overseas investors in the property development and construction sector. Real
estate companies now need a minimum project size of 20,000 square meters to invite foreign investors,
instead of the 50,000 square meters previously mandated.
