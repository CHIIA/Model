NEW YORK: A record-setting 1.89kg white truffle has sold for $73,533 at a New York City auction.
Sotheby’s says the fungus was sold yesterday to a food and wine lover from Taiwan bidding by
phone.

The truffle was found last week in Umbria, Italy, by Sabatino Truffles. The firm had said it turned
down million-dollar offers from buyers in China. Instead, it chose to auction the truffle in New York to
benefit Citymeals-on-Wheels and the Children’s Glaucoma Foundation.

The average white truffle is about the size of a walnut.Sotheby’s says the previous largest white truffle
ever found was 1.13kg.
