Asciano is keen to make its container ports business part of a "global network" but remains open to
selling all of Patrick ports if it receives the right price, chief executive John Mullen said.
"We've been focusing on a partial sale that delivers financial value and also delivers partnership
value and strategic value by working with a big overseas player to be part of a global
network," Mr Mullen told The Australian Financial Review.

"There are all sorts of procurements and other benefits that come from being tied with a strong
partner with a lot of other operations around the world rather than just being a little island down in
Australia."
Mr Mullen declined to comment on when talks on a potential sale of all or part of Patrick, which
operates container terminals in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane in competition with DP World
Australia, were likely to conclude but said negotiations had been "progressing".
Chinese industrial conglomerate China Merchants is understood to be the lead contender to invest
in Patrick, which analysts estimate is worth between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, to broaden its
international network of ports.

Asciano is prepared to sell all of Patrick but only if it receives "the right price," Mr Mullen said. "To
date, we have not received an offer or an approach for the sale of the whole business that we think
adds more value that continuing to operate it."

Asciano's shares rose 2 per cent to their highest levels since October after underlying earnings
before interest and taxation (EBIT) rose 5 per cent to $720.3 million, beating analysts' consensus
expectations of $711 million. Asciano also increased its final dividend by 36 per cent and forecast
stronger growth in underlying earnings in fiscal 2015.
Underlying earnings were driven higher by growth in the group's coal haulage business. Coal
haulage volumes rose 22 per cent while earnings from the coal division rose 15.4 per cent to
$288 million.
Investors said they were generally happy with the company's performance as Patrick ports returned
to growth. Earnings from Asciano's terminals business rose 5.4 per cent while Patrick's container lifts
rose 3.7 per cent.

"Cyclical volume headwind seems to have come to an end," Sondal Bensan said, an investment
analyst at BT Investment Management, Asciano's biggest institutional shareholder.
"The business improvement program is delivering cost outs, coal volume momentum continues,
capital spending is falling, returns are improving, and free cash flow and dividends are rapidly
growing."

being merged with its coal division. Freight rail earnings fell 17 per cent to $217 million due to
falling grain volumes and weaker demand for transport services from the resources industry.
Asciano's statutory annual net profit dropped 24 per cent to $257 million from the year earlier figure
of $336.8 million due to an 8.1 per cent rise in depreciation and amortisation linked to capital
spending and acquisitions.

Asciano's shares are up 11.5 per cent over the past 12 months compared with a 10.6 per cent rise in
the S&P/ASX 200.
