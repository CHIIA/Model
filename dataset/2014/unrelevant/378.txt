Australia's Ferrowest is continuing with the due diligence process that could result in its largest
shareholder, TFA International, lifting its stake in the miner from 29.1% to 60% through a series of share
placement and investment deals, Ferrowest Managing Director Brett Manning said Wednesday.TFA
International is the Australian subsidiary of Taifeng Group of Sichuan, China. TFA would deliver
A$100,000/month (US$92,588) to Ferrowest over the next six months and as part of the deal. Ferrowest
would also receive a 21.8% stake in one of Taifeng's proposed residential and commercial
development called Taifeng International City, being built in Jia Yu, just south of Wuhan, the capital of the
Hubei province. "Funding from Taifeng International City will be used to provide cashflow to develop
Ferrowest's iron ore projects in Australia," Manning said.

Manning recently completed a visit the Taifeng International City, where around 80% of the units in the
first residential tower have already been sold at planned prices, he said. "There has been much recent
discussion in the press about falling property prices in China, but there was no sign of falling prices at
the development," he said. Ferrowest is developing several projects in Western Australia with the closest
to production being the Yogi magnetite mine. Yogi has potential to be in production within three years at
a rate of 4.5 million mt/year, Manning said. Ferrowest is also developing the smaller Yalyirimbi iron ore
project in the Northern Territory, which is set to produce at rate of 2 million mt/year over a 10-year period.
