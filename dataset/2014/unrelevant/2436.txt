Perth, May 5
Iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest is taking a $A12M, 27.8% stake in junior Energy and Minerals
Australia (EMA) and its flagship Mulga Rock Uranium Project, 250km ENE of Kalgoorlie, Western
Australia, which is targeting production by the end of 2016.

The cash is conditional on the agreed elimination of $24.5M in debt held by promissory/convertible note
holders Australian resource investment groups Acorn Capital and Macquarie Bank, and the Element
Resources Fund. Acorn and Macquarie currently hold promissory notes in the company and all 3 also
hold convertible notes, and have agreed to convert all their convertible notes for EMA shares to repay
the promissory notes. Following the issue of the placement shares and the shares for the notes
conversion, Macquarie will hold 20.98% of the company and Acorn 23.21%.

EMA says it has a binding term sheet with Fortescue Metals boss Andrew Forest’s Forrest Family
Investments P/L for the $12M equity capital, for which it will get 400M shares at $0.03 and an attached
free unlisted option exercisable at $0.05 by June 30 2016.

The deals are subject to shareholder approval and an EGM is expected in early July 2014.

EMA remains focused on completing the FS on Mulga Rocks, which has an inferred resource of 62.2Mlb
of uranium.
