down, China physical and the Hang Seng fell and US market futures were weaker with the surprising low
December numbers a dampener on the US recovery story.

Golds and some metals benefited from the improved metal prices while the sharp fall in the banks puzzles.

"High 5333. Low 5280. Close at 5294, down 18 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open slightly
lower with our local futures contract down 4 points.

"My technical work suggests a new rally high is likely with late January a likely timeframe. My work also
suggests it is part of a topping process on an intermediate term basis. At this stage I am agnostic as to
whether it is the penultimate or final top. "The weakness in precious metals over the past two years is
signalling a liquidity event in the pipeline. This event is impacting the bond market at present. Equity
investors are always last to receive the memo.
"Watch the Japanese yen, it is the canary in the coal mine.

"The high today will be 5333. The low will be 5280. When the dust has settled the market will have closed
at 5294, down 18 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 12 points to 5312.4 on Friday evening.

Telstra Corporation announced it has entered into an agreement to sell a 70% interest in its directories
business, Sensis to US based private equity firm, Platinum Equity for $A454 million. The sale excludes
the voice services business and includes economic benefits to Telstra from services it will continue to
provide to Sensis. Telstra will retain a 30% stake with Sensis, now valued at $649 million.
Telstra said in the report Platinum Equity specialises on business operations and has had 18 years of
success. 2013 transactions included carve outs from AP Moeller Maersk, CBS, CheckPoint Systems,
Emerson and Deutsche Post DHL.
The transaction price is equal to a multiple of 2.4x Sensis' full year 2014 forecast EBITDA after adjusting
for the voice directories business which is being retained by Telstra and stand alone costs of operating
the business, consistent with valuations for recent directories transactions globally.
The sale proceeds of $A454 million are incremental to Telstra's full year 2014 free cashflow guidance of
$A4.6 billion to $A5.1 billion. Telstra expects to book an accounting loss on Sensis of approximately
