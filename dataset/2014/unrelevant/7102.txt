2350 GMT [Dow Jones]--Battery maker Redflow's (RFX.AU) cash balance of A$10.2 million ($9.2
million) at end-June should be sufficient to see the company through to breakeven in 12-18 months,
says Morgans analyst Nick Harris. He sees a number of value-creating milestones on the horizon for the
company. These include manufacturing being fully outsourced to Flextronics (FLEX) within the next four
months, and systems integrator trials of its zinc-bromide battery module, known as ZBM, in the field over
the next 3-18 months. "While Redflow is not without risk, we see considerable upside if success is
achieved," Harris says. "Success in systems integrator trials should lead to niche market adoption now
and potentially mass market adoption later on." Morgans rates the stock at add, up its price target by
6.5% to A$0.33. RFX last traded at A$0.27. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2348 GMT [Dow Jones] The latest Australian crop estimates suggest another soft year ahead for the
country, which will weigh on GrainCorp's (GNC.AU). Bell Potter trims its expectations for the harvest
collected by GNC and lowers its forecast for fiscal 2015 net profit by 9.3% and for FY16 by 0.4%. That
pitches Bell Potter's FY15 forecast roughly 15% below the concensus view of analysts. "GNC looks to
now endure two years of what we would call below average [harvest] receivals and cashflow at a time
when it is in the middle of a A$515 million growth capex program." It retains a hold recommendation and
A$8.37/share target. GNC last traded at A$8.75. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2347 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to trade in a higher range near term after hitting a
two-session low of $90.63/bbl on Monday but settling up 65 cents at $92.92/bbl, Dow Jones technical
analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the five- and 15-day moving averages are
declining, but the daily slow stochastic indicator is bullish. Resistance is at $93.03 (Monday's high); a
breach would target $93.67 (Friday's high, near the middle 20-day Bollinger Band), then $93.94 (Sept. 9
high), $94.99 (Sept. 5 high), $95.39 (Sept. 4 high), $95.83 (Sept. 3 high) and $96.00 (Aug. 29 high, near
upper 20-day two-standard deviation Bollinger Band). But a drop below the $90.63 support would tilt the
near-term view negative, targeting $90.43 (16-month low hit Thursday), then $90.11 (May 1, 2013,
reaction low), the psychological $90.00 line, $87.55 (April 22, 2013, low) and $85.61 (April 18, 2013,
swing low). October crude is down 12 cents at $92.80/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
2341 GMT [Dow Jones] Iron-ore prices jump 3.9% as stronger steel prices prompt mills to restock the
raw material, says Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Lachlan Shaw. Steelmakers are also
topping up stockpiles ahead of China's National Day holiday in October, he says. According to The Steel
Index, 62% iron fines last traded at US$85.20/ton, bouncing from a five-year low.

11:32 GMT [Dow Jones] Foreign ownership of New Zealand's domestic equities stands at 38%, a level
that is back to pre-GFC highs and 400 bps above 10-year averages, says Forsyth Barr. The percentage
has jumped over the last two years as New Zealand has enjoyed stronger relative growth than the rest of
the world but it "raises the issue of implications should NZ fall out of favor as an investment destination,"
it says. It notes there could be "quantum selling" by foreigners. It underscores that NZ equity foreign
ownership changes are closely correlated with the Australian rather than U.S. dollar and it will likely "be
the relative attractiveness of Australian relative to NZ stocks that will drive ownership changes." It says
NZ stocks dual listed in Australia "would be at most risk." (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

2330 GMT [Dow Jones] Macquarie (MQG.AU) likely has even more earnings upside from higher
performance fees, especially if its unlisted infrastructure fund MEIF 1 can exit remaining assets in line

Page58of320©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.with current valuations, UBS says. Macquarie now forecasts its FY15 profit will be up slightly where it had
earlier pointed to a flat performance, thanks to higher performance fees from listed and unlisted funds.
UBS suggests the higher fees primarily relate to MEIF 1, which in recent months has sold stakes in
French toll roads and the Stockholm airport rail connection Arlanda Express. The brokerage says further
performance fees are highly likely as the rest of the portfolio is sold over the next about 18 months. It
has a neutral recommendation and A$57/share target. MQG last traded at A$58.55.

2317 GMT [Dow Jones] Cochlear (COH.AU) shares may get a boost after U.S. regulators approved a
key function of its latest-generation Nucleus 6 hearing implant, allowing the device to connect wirelessly
with smartphones. Cochlear's revenue has come under pressure in recent months, as customers held
out for the full range of technological functions to become available. Analysts, including at J.P. Morgan,
had warned approval delays for the wireless function were widening rival Advanced Bionic's advantage
over Cochlear. Coincidentally, the Federal Drug Administration's approval comes as Apple Inc. prepares
to release its latest iPhone device. COH was last at A$67.23. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2307 GMT [Dow Jones]--Bell Potter downgrades Australian listed fund managers to underweight due to
recent legislative change that will reduce a planned increase in pension-fund contributions from
employers. The broker warned of "vulnerable momentum" in the sector in April. "I believe there are now
valid reasons for 'strategic' caution after a major legislative change that should see price to earnings
(relative to the market) fall in the sector as forward earnings growth is harder to generate," Bell Potter
executive director Charlie Aitken says. "These are major changes to the rate of growth of compulsory
superannuation contributions which in my view means Australian fund managers will have to rely on
market based growth rather than structural inflow growth for the next six years." Mr. Aitken continues to
favor AMP (AMP.AU). (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)
2302 GMT [Dow Jones] Now that it has sold its main Australian assets, the focus for Karoon Gas
(KAR.AU) turns to Brazil, where UBS hopes the coming Kangaroo-2 well will provide a "share price
bounce" when it's drilled between September and December. Karoon and joint venture partner Pacific
Rubiales (PRE.T) have already had some success with the Kangaroo-1 and Kangaroo West wells and a
further oil discovery would help prove up the quality of the resource. Although the drilling program is
risky, UBS notes Karoon's US$600 million sale of Australian assets to Origin (ORG.AU) provides
A$2.44/share of cash backing, offering considerable protection if well results disappoint. The shares
could also benefit from a further sell-down of Karoon's stake in the promising Brazilian assets, UBS
says, applying a buy recommendation and A$5.50 price target vs. Karoon's last trade of A$3.74.

2255 GMT [Dow Jones] The realignment of Johnson Controls' building efficiency business unit includes a
management shakeup as part of separating the unit's service and HVAC products businesses. Dave
Myers, president of the building unit, resigned after 20 years with JCI. He has been replaced by Bill
Jackson, who worked in JCI's automotive business after joining the company in 2011. Trent Nevill will
continue as vice president and general manager in charge of building efficiency's service business, which
accounted for 45% of building efficiency's $3.9 billion of revenue in 2013. Building efficiency has
become a more important business to JCI as the company scales back its automotive business in
search of better margins and a higher stock price. JCI ended down 1.2% at $46.02. (robert.tita@wsj.com)

2252 GMT [Dow Jones] Johnson Controls JCI is splitting the service and products businesses of its
building-efficiency unit, a move that JCI hopes will give the businesses more room to expand and focus
on customers. "I think it's going to make us a better company," says CEO Alex Molinaroli in an interview.
"Both of these businesses are very important to our future," he says. The service business has 120
branches that install, repair and maintain heating and air conditioning systems in commercial buildings.
The products side of the buildings business builds York-brand HVAC equipment and recently entered
into a joint venture with Hitachi for variable refrigerant technology. JCI ended down 1.2% at $46.02.

2252 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's central bank will publish minutes of its September policy meeting at
0130 GMT. ANZ says in a research note it expects a more optimistic message on the domestic economy
to be conveyed, but is also looking to see if the level of concern among policy makers about China's
property market is on the rise. The Australian dollar has had its biggest fall against the U.S. dollar in
more than a year in the last week in part due to uncertainty about China. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter
