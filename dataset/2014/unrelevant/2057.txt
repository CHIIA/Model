STRATEGIC DIRECTION

Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd is expected to focus on improving its online offering over the forecast
period. The company is not expected to engage in outlet expansion over the forecast period given the
constrained retailing environment in Australia during 2013. Rather, Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd will
seek to maintain its existing store network.

COMPANY BACKGROUND

As part of the Toys “R” Us Inc international network of licensees and franchisees, Toys “R” Us
(Australia) Pty Ltd was introduced in 1993, with its first stores in Melbourne. Within a year, the company
had expanded to 17 stores across various states in Australia. Toys “R” Us has since grown to 35 stores
nationwide.

Toys “R” Us is a speciality retailer of toys and games targeting children. The growing popularity of
electronic games has seen the stores begin to carry gaming consoles, electronic pads and other
electronic toys, to cater to the changing consumer preferences in Australia and across the world.
In 2005, Toys “R” Us faced uncertainty, following the privatisation of the parent company and the
restructuring of the entire organisation. Toys “R” Us in Australia has not been able to realise profits
since its launch in 1993. However, the restructuring undertaken by the group mainly concentrated on
the sale of underperforming retailing brands, and the impact on the international network was minimal.

Toys “R” Us launched the Babies “R” Us retailing brand in 2008, in a side-by-side store format in
Bankstown, New South Wales. Babies “R” Us provides focused product lines in clothing, furniture and
furnishings, toys, feeding needs and so on, for children up to two years old. The company has
continued to roll out the speciality baby stores within Toys “R” Us outlets. There is also a dedicated site
for this brand.

PRIVATE LABEL

Toys “R” Us offers branded products, as well as private label products exclusive to Toys “R” Us, in its
retail offering of toys and games, children’s clothing, furniture and furnishings. The company has set up
a dedicated sourcing office in China to manage its private label manufacturing. The company has also
included organic and natural products in its private label offerings, in line with consumers’ concern about
toy safety, particularly since the massive toy recall issues for Chinese manufacturers in 2007.

Toys “R” Us emphasises products which are of high quality, and provides toys which allow learning,
imagination and pure fun. However, it is challenged by the big toy manufacturers’ heavy marketing and
advertising initiatives, and struggles to attain high awareness and sales for its private label products

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd held a value share of less than 1% in retailing during 2013, being ranked
53rd. The company’s market share has remained somewhat static over the review period. The
company was ranked fifth within leisure and personal goods specialist retailers during 2013, with a
value share of 2%.

Despite accounting for a negligible share of both retailing and leisure and personal goods specialist
retailers, Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd was the leading player within traditional toys and games stores
in 2013. During 2013 the company held a 26% value share, up from 20% in 2008. The company has
managed to capitalise on its global branding and large-format store setup to capture demand from
parents and children. Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd’s main competitor is Associated Retailers Ltd with
the Toyworld fascia. Toyworld possessed 163 stores in 2013, compared with the 35 stores for Toys “R”
Us. However, the average selling space per Toys “R” Us stores was approximately 3,394 sq m,
compared with 500 sq m for Toyworld.

Page100of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.During 2013 the company continued to face a challenging retail environment, with value sales for
traditional toys and game stores declining by 5% to reach A$1.0 billion. During 2013 the category faced
severe competition from internet retailing and mass merchandisers. As a result, Toys “R” Us (Australia)
Pty Ltd continued to invest in its online store during 2013, with internet retailing sales increasing by 6%
to reach A$5 million. However, Toys “R” Us currently competes with overseas online retailers which
tend to offer competitive prices due to their exemption from the Goods and Services Tax (GST). This will
continue to remain a concern for Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd over the forecast period.

Toys “R” Us (Australia) Pty Ltd’s Babies “R” Us brand possessed 11 stores in 2013 and was located
within the other leisure and personal goods specialist retailers category, competing with brands such as
Baby Bunting, Mothercare and My Baby Warehouse. Babies “R” Us was positively impacted by the
closure of 29 Mothercare stores during 2013. Indeed, Toys “R” Us also benefitted from the closure of
Mothercare Plc’s Early Learning Centre stores during 2013.
