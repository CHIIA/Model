11:12 GMT [Dow Jones] The hail and strong winds that battered Brisbane last week may have caused
anywhere between A$200 million and A$500 million in insured damages to homes and cars, according
to J.P. Morgan estimates based on Sydney's 2007 hail storm. Suncorp (SUN.AU), which has an about
40% market share in Queensland state, is likely to be the most affected by the cost of the storm. The
brokerage suggests the cost could test the A$250 million deductable that SUN has for reinsurance.
Insurance Australia Group (IAG.AU) and QBE (QBE.AU) will be far less affected, it says, adding that
insurance stocks tend to underperform soon after big events such as this. (robb.stewart@wsj.com;

11:11 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY will likely move in a 118.20-119.30 range in Asia trade, says
Mizuho Securities FX strategist Kenji Yoshii. The pair "will likely remain firm" on expectation for upbeat
reading of the U.S. economic data later this week, including jobs data scheduled on Friday. And for now,
investors will monitor closely November ISM manufacturing report and speech by the Fed's Stanley
Fischer later today. The USD/JPY is now at 118.86 against 118.67 late Friday in New York. Ahead of the
ECB meeting later this week, the EUR/USD is tipped in a 1.2400-1.2470 range and is now at 1.2446.

2308 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan slashes its price target on caravan and accommodation
manufacturer Fleetwood Corp (FWD.AU) as a downturn in the resources market takes its toll. The broker
cuts the target to A$1.51 a share from A$2.00, noting a pickup in the education market has so far failed
to offset the decline in resources business. "Given the transition in FWD's customer base from
Resources to Education is ongoing, forecasting a bottoming of margins and eventual recovery can be
difficult. While we appreciate the operating leverage in the business is significant, with the outlook
remaining mixed, we see downside risk to near-term consensus earnings estimates," the broker says.
Keeps an Underweight rating on the stock which last traded at A$1.25. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com;

Forget about a Christmas rally, says Charlie Aitken, executive director at Bell Potter Securities. His view
is that the ASX 200 remains in a 5100-5450 range that is likely to become more entrenched as
commodity price falls lead to cuts in GDP and company earnings forecasts for fiscal 2015. Aitken also
says AUD is quickly heading to US$0.80 and will hit his US$0.75 target by mid-2015. Still, Aitken says he
anticipates increased speculation the Australian central bank will cut rates in 2015, which will support
equity dividend yield. His top nonbank yield recommendations are Telstra (TLS.AU), Insurance Australia
Group (IAG.AU), AMP (AMP.AU), Transurban (TCL.AU) and Wesfarmers. Among the banks, he
suggests buying ANZ (ANZ.AU) and NAB (NAB.AU). Aitken also likes Qantas (QAN.AU) as it
approaches his A$2/share target. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2307 GMT [Dow Jones] Comments by RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler "reinforce a degree of comfort
in presenting an extended pause in their tightening cycle at their upcoming Dec. 11 monetary policy
statement," says Chris Green, First NZ Capital Director, Economics and Strategy. He says the "Future
Challenges" section refers to a "combination of weaker than anticipated domestic inflationary pressures
-- involving a reassessment of the NZ's historic growth and inflation dynamic -- together with an
increased awareness regarding the potential implications and feed-back loops of global factors -- both
international growth prospects and policy actions." Green says these factors largely explain the recent

2015. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)

2304 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said he hopes the government will
make an announcement on the appointment of the new Treasury Secretary in coming days. The
government has dragged its feet on making a decision, even as the integrity of its budget has been
eroded by the blocking of key revenue and spending measures in the Senate, and a sharp decline in
commodity prices in 2015, including a 50% fall in the price of iron ore, the country's biggest export.
Outgoing Treasury Secretary Martin Parkinson warned last week that the country's living standard could
fall unless hard decisions are made to repair the budget. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

2256 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter upgrades Technology One (TNE.AU) to hold from sell, maintaining
the software company still has a bright future and that it had only been advising punters to avoid the
stock on valuation grounds. Technology One offers software to businesses for purposes such as
financing and payroll. Like most companies it's facing a deteriorating economic outlook in Australia as
the country's long mining boom fades. "While we now see the stock as more fairly valued around the
current share price, we do not see any clear catalysts in the short term to move the share price
upwards," Bell Potter says, keeping its price target at A$3.00/share. TNE last at A$2.99.

2154 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/USD continues to be sold on rallies and is maintaining a downward
bias, says NZForex Senior FX Dealer Mitch McIntyre. "The kiwi is likely to remain range-bound in week
ahead, with a focus on off-shore events for impetus." He adds the decline in commodity prices, economic
and monetary divergence favoring the U.S., and the slow-down in China remain the dominant themes in
the market. "Keep a close eye on oil prices, with the decline last week the most severe since the
financial crisis of 2008." The pair is at 0.7822. McIntyre adds the pair remains in a relatively tight range of
0.7800 to 0.8000. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2252 GMT [Dow Jones] As many as 10,000 insurance claims could follow in the wake of last week's
storm in Brisbane, one of the biggest storms in years, Bell Potter says. Suncorp (SUN.AU) on Friday said
it had already received about 2,600 motor and home claims, although the cost would be limited to a
maximum A$250 million thanks to reinsurance cover. "The overall picture remains very manageable,"
Bell Potter says, adding the impact for Insurance Australia Group (IAG.AU) and QBE (QBE.AU) will be
much lower given their smaller footprint in Queensland state. It has a hold recommendation for SUN and
a A$15/share target. SUN last traded at A$14.34. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2248 GMT [Dow Jones] A 4.4% fall in New Zealand's 3Q goods terms of trade was in line with market
expectations "with the volume splits suggesting a negative contribution to 3Q GDP," says ANZ Senior
EconomistMark Smith. He says a continued weakness in dairy commodity export prices suggest further
falls are in prospect, although the terms of trade are expected to settle at still elevated levels. "A benign
import price environment is expected to contribute to low inflation and keep pending OCR increases
parked until the end of next year," adds Smith. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)
2232 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's equity market is likely to continue falling Monday as resources stocks
remain under pressure. IG forecasts an opening fall for the ASX 200 of 23 points to about 5290, a strong
technical support level it suggests could be broken Monday. The spot iron-ore price rose 0.1% to
US$69.80/ton, which could offer some respite for mining shares, but Friday's 1.7% drop in BHP Billiton's
(BHP.AU) U.S. ADR suggests it could fall further Down Under. IG market strategist Evan Lucas says that
with bear markets for oil and iron ore, it isn't hard to understand the selling in BHP. He adds energy
stocks such as Santos (STO.AU) and Oil Search (OSH.AU) could be hit again after falling sharply
Friday. The ASX 200 ended Friday down 1.6% at 5313. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2230 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's manufacturing sector is finally feeling lucky as the falling Australian
dollar, tumbling energy costs and low interest rates have underpinned a small expansion in the sector in
November. The Australian Industry Group Australian Performance of Manufacturing Index rose by 0.7
points to 50.1 in November from October. The reading above 50 points indicates expansion, albeit small.
The reading compares with a 48.1 points average over the last dismal 12 months for the sector. "While
the improvement in manufacturing activity in November is slight, it and the lift in new orders are welcome
signs of the resilience of the sector in the face of still-testing conditions," said AIGroup Chief Executive,
Innes Willox. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
