0321 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is down 0.2% at 14,451.65 midday on light, pre-holiday volume on
pace to rival 2014 lows. "There are very few trading incentives, except some technical trades on
individual shares that have seen some extreme moves of late," says an equity trading director at a
European brokerage. He notes Inpex's (1605.T0) 2.4% pullback to Y1,487 after the prior day's identical
2.4% rise. "There is no 'real' (long-term investment) money in the market, and that's why we've been
seeing such knee-jerk reactions in some stocks. Without any Bank of Japan easing or some other
macro-reason for investors to bet on the Nikkei, we could continue to simply churn like this through May."
Sony (6758.TO) is now off just 1.5% at Y1,783, recouping some of its early losses after the company
issued a profit warning after the Thursday market close. NKSJ Holdings (8630.TO) also cut its current FY
guidance, but its shares remain up 0.5% at Y2,667. Alps Electric (6770.TO) is up 1.1% after gaining 14%
over the prior two sessions. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0320 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's north eastern state of Queensland recorded a 20.8% jump in new
home sales in the first quarter of 2013 from the prior quarter, sending a strong signal that recovery in
housing construction is widening quickly beyond the larger capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. Nationally,
new home sales rose 5.8% in the same period, the Housing Industry Authority said. Housing construction
is expected to be a key engine room of economic growth for Australia as it battles a slowdown in mining
investment over coming years. The data will support the central bank's contention that the economy is
starting to look a little more solid, supporting its neutral policy bias. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

0318 GMT [Dow Jones] First quarter results for Malaysia's largest banks justify a positive outlook for the
sector, says Affin Investment Bank, but there are near-term risks to loan growth. Affin reiterates its
overweight position on the banks, "premised on stable economic fundamentals and the ability of
Malaysian banks to withstand industry headwinds." It picks Malayan Banking Bhd. (1155.KU), Alliance
Financial Group Bhd. (2488.KU) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd. (5819.KU) as favorites. Diving into the
statistics, Affin likes the robust growth in loan applications, both from the business and household
segments, but warns of liquidity trending lower and central bank cooling measures. Stock prices
however, have yet to reflect investor enthusiasm. Maybank trades down 0.3% early Friday, with Hong
Leong 0.9% lower and Alliance Financial flat. (jake.watts@wsj.com; @jmwatts_)

0310 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan HSBC April PMI expands at the slowest rate in 7 months, pointing to
lingering caution among manufacturers over the still-uneven global recovery, despite a steady pickup in
new orders led by developed economies. April PMI is at 52.3, marginally below the long-run average of
52.4; new orders accelerate but the pace of job growth is the slowest in almost a year. "The slowdown in
Mainland China, the very weak U.S. Q1 GDP release, and subdued price pressures suggests to us that
there is still a significant degree of spare capacity, which will persist," HSBC economist, John Zhu says.
Taiwan mainly exports electronic components and petrochemical products. It reported a 3% growth of 1Q
GDP Wednesday, the best in over a year, as both exports and domestic demand improved.

daily SGD/THB chart suggests. Technical analysis reveals SGD/THB entered the bullish Bollinger
uptrend channel on April 30. The Bollinger channel is a statistics-based technical analysis tool that charts
a likely path of future price movement by extrapolating from the amplitude of recent fluctuations. The
base of the channel supports the Singapore dollar at THB25.80; one Singapore dollar currently buys
THB25.84. Entry into the Bollinger uptrend channel is a bullish signal that could motivate speculators to
bet on further upside, possibly toward the round-figure trading barrier at 26.00. Fundamentally, the
prolonged political stalemate in Thailand is dampening investor sentiment and thereby the baht. The
Singapore dollar as a regional safe haven currency is likely to hold its value better even if risk aversion
arises in the near future due to geopolitical instability. SGD/THB is now 25.84 from its last close of 25.80.

0232 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong-listed shipping stocks are rising on the back of planned rate hikes
and improved market sentiment. Member carriers in the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, an industry
group of 15 major container shipping lines that operate between Asia and North America, are seeking to
charge a peak season surcharge of US$400 per 40-foot-equivalent unit for all shipments to the U.S. from
mid-June, on top of an up to a US$400 general rate increase from May 15. "Transpacific container lines
continue to experience a surge in eastbound bookings that began in January and is expected to continue
into the second half of 2014," the trade group says. China Cosco (1919.HK) is up 2% while Orient
Overseas (0316.HK) advances 0.9%. (joanne.chiu@wsj.com)

0231 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia inflation eased further in April, showing Bank Indonesia is on track to
prevent prices increase from getting out of control after introducing a dose of hard medicine last year,
including rate hikes and curbs in commercial bank lending growth. The consumer price index rose 7.25%
in April from a year earlier, easing from 7.32% in March, as harvest season helped boost food supply, the
official Statistics Agency said Friday. From a month earlier, prices fell 0.02%, compared with a 0.08%
increase in March, as food prices fell 1.1%. But inflation is still well above Bank Indonesia's year-end
target range of 3.5% and 5.5% for this year, meaning the central bank will unlikely start to reverse its
stance this year, economists say. (i-made.sentana@wsj.com)

0230 GMT [Dow Jones] Southeast Asian markets open mixed, with most markets returning after the
Labor Day holiday on Thursday. The Philippines PSEi leads, up 0.5%, followed by Indonesia's JSX with a
0.3% gain. Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index loses 0.3% and Malaysia's KLCI is 0.1% lower.
Sentiment is little changed by official manufacturing data from China, which Thursday showed a slight
pickup in factory activity. Also in the minds of traders is a U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for April, due
during the U.S. session. As expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve took no action Wednesday, leaving
trading in Asia with no further cues. "Dad used to say, if you don't know what's going on it's best to keep
quiet. Seems to work for the Fed.," DBS jokes. (jake.watts@wsj.com; jmwatts_)

0222 GMT [Dow Jones] The rupiah is still the best-performing Asian currency this year, up 5.5% against
the U.S. unit, despite having slipped substantially from its 2014 high of IDR11,245 recorded in March.
The rupiah, now trading at 11,530 to the dollar, fell sharply end-April as the prospect of a coalition
government damped investors' appetite for Indonesian assets. The presidential elections July 1 will
provide more clarity for Indonesia's political future. Currently, USD/IDR has dropped out of the Bollinger
uptrend channel, indicating the rupiah may stop sliding against the dollar for now. But a possible upside
surprise in the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due later could reinstate U.S. dollar bullishness. The USD/IDR
is at 11,530 from its last close of 11,558. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0216 GMT [Dow Jones] The prospect of increased income tax in the Australian Federal Budget on May
13 is "just another reason to maintain a tactically bearish stance" on Australian equities, according to
Charlie Aitken, Bell Potter's managing director. "Let's hope I am reading this political risk wrongly, but be
very assured if the 'debt levy' becomes reality in the upcoming Federal Budget it clearly has the potential
to trigger a correction in Australian equities," he says. "Even the thought of it has triggered a
mini-correction in banks and retailers." It has been suggested that a levy will be introduced on
high-income earners to speed the process of reducing Australia's budget deficit. Australia's benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 is flat at 5445.0 but has fallen as much as 2.2% after hitting a six-year high on Tuesday.

0213 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/TWD is slightly lower, weighed by foreign fund inflows, says a local trader.
The pair is at 30.174, lower than 30.180 traded before the local central bank's suspected intervention
Wednesday, which lifted it to 30.258 at the close of onshore trading session, traders say. A trader says
trading volume is thin as many market participants refrain from trading actively ahead of the U.S. jobs
data due later in the global day; "the greenback is unlikely to fall below NT$30.150 as importers' buying
turns more active around that level," the trader says, and tips the pair to stay in a 30.150-30.200 band for
the session. The Taiex is up 0.8%. Taiwan's financial markets were closed Thursday for the Labor Day
holiday. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0211 GMT [Dow Jones] Crude-oil futures are slightly lower in early Asian trade after settling lower for two
consecutive sessions in floor trade. "Upside in the U.S. benchmark continues to be capped by high
inventory levels, particularly along the gulf coast. Inventories in the region rose to 215.3 million barrels
last week, the highest level since the early 90's," ANZ says. Investors will be tracking the U.S. payrolls
report due later in the day for the state of the world's largest economy. Markets are also digesting
economic data from the U.S. and China after the May Day holiday. "Events in eastern Ukraine and
related tensions over Russian supplies remain of great interest to the market but the market may have
reached the point where it will take an actual disruption to Russian export flows to drive a renewed cycle
of buying," Citi Futures says. Nymex WTI is down 7 cents at $99.35/bbl, Brent crude is down 11 cents at
$107.65/bbl. (eric.yep@wsj.com)
