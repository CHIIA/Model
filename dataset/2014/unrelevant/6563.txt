Market nosedives as investors offload bank shares

Stocks Sally Rose

The market tumbled on the first day of May as investors sold banking stocks despite strong first-half
earnings by ANZ, while miners fell after the iron ore price plunged further. The S&P/ASX 200 Index lost
40.3points, or 0.7 per cent, on Thursday to 5448.8, while the All Ordinaries also lost 0.7 per cent to
5430.4, with all sectors in the red. A more optimistic outlook for US economic growth from the Federal
Reserve helped lift the Dow Jones index to a record close but it was not enough to buoy the local market.
A report commissioned by the government sparked fears of a tough

federal budget that could curb domestic growth at a time when the value of Australia's most important
export, iron ore, is under pressure. The market rose briefly when trade began following equity markets in
the US, which lifted after the Federal Reserve concluded its April meeting with the announcement it will
cut its monthly stimulus by another $US10 billion as flagged. "The commentary was more upbeat than
last meeting and I think that's appropriate," said BlackRock Australia's head of fixed income, Steve Miller.
ANZ dropped 1.2 per cent to $34.07 despite beating analyst forecasts to report an 11 per cent rise in
half-year profit, lifting its interim dividend more than expected by 14per cent to 83ï¿½ a share, and
showing the bank's controversial strategy to expand in to Asia is on track. The other big banks were also
lower. Commonwealth Bank fell 0.3per cent to $78.64, Westpac lost 1.2 per cent to $34.70 and National
Australia Bank shed 1.7 per cent to $34.71. Telstra declined 0.4 per cent to $5.20. Insurance stocks were
mostly higher, with QBE Insurance, AMP and Suncorp advancing. Mining was the worst-performing
sector, down 1.1 per cent, as iron ore prices approached a 12-month low, Chinese data showed demand
for

Australia's biggest export is growing more slowly than hoped, and the world's biggest producer, Brazil's
Vale SA, posted a steeper decline in first-quarter profit than expected due to weaker iron ore prices and
tipped them to fall further. China's official manufacturing purchasing managers index rose 0.1points in
April to 50.4 points, missing expectations for a rise to 50.5. The spot price for iron ore, landed in China,
fell 2.7 per cent to $US105.40 a tonne.. Australian resources giant BHP Billiton lost 0.7 per cent to
$37.50, main rival Rio Tinto fell 1.5 per cent to $60.79 while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group
dropped 4per cent to $4.85.
