THE 1847 Winery company had its beginnings in the 1990s when former Sydney property developer
John Curnow and wife Sue bought two Barossa Valley vineyards, one of which was the site of the
original land grant made to Orlando founder Johann Gramp in 1847.

That historic link inspired the Curnows to launch their 1847 wine brand in 2004.

Using grapes from their own vineyards and from contract growers, they built a major wine export
business with sales to China, Hong Kong, the US, Canada, Hungary and Singapore.
John Curnow said last week he and Sue had sold the business three years ago to Sydney-based
Chinese investors, who now had a 30-strong chain of 1847 liquor stores in China. John has stayed on
as chief executive of 1847 Winery, which now has 60 hectares of established Barossa vineyard and 20
hectares of new plantings.

Over the years, production of 1847 wines had been carried out in a number of different wineries and
the purchase of Yaldara would give the company its own processing facility and cellar door from
which to build domestic sales of the 1847 and Yaldara brand wines. Until now, exports had made up 90
per cent of 1847 Winery's production, with sales in Australia just mail order.
