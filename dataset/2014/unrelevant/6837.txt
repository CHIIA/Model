SYDNEY—U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital has appointed Reunion Capital Partners to advise on
an initial public offering of Australian accounting software maker MYOB Ltd. worth up to 3 billion
Australian dollars (US$2.58 billion), a person familiar with the situation said.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and UBS are expected to be appointed as
joint lead managers for the float, which is likely to occur in the first half of 2015 and give the company
a market valuation of A$2.5 billion to A$3.0 billion, the person said Thursday.

Bain is expected to retain a large stake in the company after the listing, another person familiar with
the situation said.

MYOB provides tax accounting and other services to small-to-medium businesses in Australia, New
Zealand, the U.S., Latin America, the U.K., Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Bain and funds advised by the buyout firm bought MYOB from a consortium including Australian
private-equity firmArcher Capital and international asset manager HarbourVest Partners in 2011 for
around A$1.2 billion.
In May last year, MYOB acquired smaller New Zealand-based rival BankLink for 136 million New
Zealand dollars.
