The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close mildly higher today.

Europe closed higher, the UK rose, US markets closed higher.

On the NYSE where 3203 issues traded there were 2,248 issues higher, 850 down and 105 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2728 issues traded there were 1,684 issues higher, 949 down and 95 unchanged.
Metals were mostly higher, crude fell, gold was down. The $A is at 90.90US c, up about 35 points from
last evening.

"Support at 5310, resistance at 5335, followed by 5350 .. I'll call us up 25 points' Ben Faulkner, a senior
adviser with Morgans said, "Starting with gold, I suggested yesterday that traders will begin to take profits.
There was a bit of a sell off last night - also Deutsche Bank was telling clients to short the stock.
"$1360 should be good support, gold is still in a strong uptrend. The 20 day moving average is at about
$1340.

"Looking at the Shanghai market, it had a pretty savage sell off in mid February and the chart is still
medium term bearish - has been in downtrend since November last year. It is encouraging to see the 2000
level of strong support that held in January in the sell off remains strong support.

"The Shanghai market is still in a short term downtrend, trading below the 3 month moving average.
Resistance is at 2050. A break of 2050 is needed before we see any confirmation of a neutral or bullish
breakout.

"With regard to the S&P 500, support held around the 1840 level, it broke back and closed above the 20
day moving average. Support is still around 1845. There is still room to move to the upside before we
experience resistance at 1870. That picture improved over night.

"On the XJO, interestingly the index closed right on the 50 and 100 day moving average yesterday.
Support remains at 5295. Resistance remains at about 5350. A key level to watch this week is 5350.

"With regard to intra day levels, support is at 5310, initial resistance at 5335 followed by 5350.

"For the day I will call us up 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 11.8 points to 6317.6 points last evening.

March 18. Good morning.

*Latest on Crimea and sanctions against Russia

Page12of289©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Media services report the European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on 21 Russian and
Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin
signed a decree recognising the region as a sovereign state.

This followed a disputed referendum in the Black Sea peninsula on Sunday in which Crimea's leaders
declared a Soviet-style, 97-percent vote to secede from Ukraine.

The US leveled sanctions on 7 Russians. The EU will discuss further measures when they meet later this
week.

Within hours, the Crimean parliament formally asked that Russia "admit the Republic of Crimea as a new
subject with the status of a republic". Putin will on Tuesday address a special joint session of Russia's
State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian
region.

Kiev and the West said the referendum, held under armed Russian occupation, violated Ukraine's
constitution and international law.

Putin himself, suspected in the West of trying to resurrect as much as possible of the former Soviet Union
under Russian leadership, was not on the blacklist. A White House spokesman declined to rule out adding
him at a later stage.

Amid fears that Russia may move into eastern Ukraine where there is a significant Russian-speaking
community, Obama warned that "further provocations' would only increase Moscow's isolation and exact a
greater toll on its economy.
