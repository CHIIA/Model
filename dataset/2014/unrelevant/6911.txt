HONG KONG--State-owned Chinese food giant Cofco Corp. has placed a bid to buy a minority stake
in privately owned Netherlands-based grain trader Nidera, the latest move by the world's most populous
country to acquire overseas assets to secure access to resources.
Cofco submitted a binding bid for the stake last month, a person familiar with the transaction said. The
stake is worth around US$250 million, but it wasn't immediately clear how much Cofco will pay.

Although it is China's largest state-owned grain trader, Cofco has veered away from multibillion-dollar
deals overseas, preferring to buy smaller assets. In 2011, it bought Australian sugar producer Tully
Sugar for around 136 million Australian dollars (US$123 million). It has also bought vineyards in Chile
and France.
Having a stake in Rotterdam-based Nidera gives Cofco access to a company with exposure to major
grain-producing areas in Latin America. Nidera, founded in the 1920s, took its name from first letters of
countries where it had dealings: Netherlands, the (East) Indies, Deutschland (Germany), England,
Russia and Argentina, according to its website. It employs around 3,800 people in 20 countries.

Cofco couldn't be reached for comment, while Nidera declined to comment.

The terms of the deal are still under discussion, the person said.
Cofco and other Chinese companies are eager to purchase access to agricultural resources as
increasing urbanization changes domestic food tastes and drives demand, while toxic food scandals
have sparked mounting concerns about food safety. Scandals since 2008, when at least six children
died from drinking milk tainted with the industrial chemical melamine--nearly 300,000 others fell
ill--include a recent recall by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of donkey meat that contained the DNA of other
animals.
The country's growing wealth is also prompting changing patterns in food trade: China became a net
importer of rice in 2011, with the gap between exports and imports widening in recent years.
