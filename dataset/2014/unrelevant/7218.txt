HONG KONG -- Investment banks in Asia are pedaling uphill as revenue for advising companies on
everything from share sales to asset purchases remains at its lowest level since the global financial
crisis.

After a promising start to the year, investment banks in Asia ended up suffering their worst first quarter
by revenue since 2009, following a steady decline over the past three years. For the Asian-Pacific
region, including Japan, investment-banking revenue fell to $3.1 billion from $3.2 billion for the same
period last year, according to data provider Dealogic. In the first quarter of 2009, at the depths of the
global financial crisis, fees totaled $1.6 billion.

In 2013, revenue for the region was $12.4 billion, also the lowest since 2009.

The first-quarter decline came even as bankers in Asia expected a big year for deals, thanks to
recovering global growth and signs that China's economy, the world's second-biggest behind the U.S.,
would avoid a hard landing.
Global investment banks bulked up operations in Asia in the wake of the global financial crisis, hiring
staff and offering a wider suite of services in an attempt to cash in on fast growth in the region. But
returns have proved disappointing as market activity has fluctuated and costs have risen. Many banks
have cut back.
This year, revenue from underwriting share sales rose strongly in the first quarter, but Hong Kong, one
of the region's biggest financial centers, is nursing its wounds after losing major initial public offerings.
These include an offering by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that is expected to raise more than $15
billion but is now headed to the U.S. And Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
has scrapped plans to list its Watson's unit locally after selling a $5.7 billion stake to Singapore's
Temasek Holdings Pte.

Selling shares is typically the single biggest money earner for investment banks. In the first quarter, it
made up almost half of revenue as earnings from bond sales and mergers and acquisitions declined.

Revenue for underwriting syndicated loans -- corporate loans sold by a group of banks -- slumped 20%
from a year earlier to $430 million, debt capital markets fell 30% and M&A was down 20%.

Earnings declines in those areas were largely offset by gains from arranging and underwriting share
sales, which was the biggest earner for banks and made up almost half of total revenue in the quarter.
Equity capital markets revenue rose 68% compared with a year earlier to $1.4 billion.
Equity capital markets "is clearly on an upward trend this year, while M&A is due for a rebound in the
region," said Nick Gardiner, a Hong Kong-based partner at Boston Consulting Group. Debt capital
markets "is the area where I wouldn't have expectations for much of a boost."
China alone accounted for 37% of investment-banking revenue in Asia and was among a handful of
countries that recorded growth from a year earlier, helped by a string of deals in the technology sector.
The country's Internet companies, including Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd., spent more than $2
billion on acquisitions and investments in March alone.

acquisitions. Earlier this year, it announced a pair of deals valued at $5 billion.

Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka were the only other countries where investment banks' revenue
increased relative to the first quarter of 2013, although there was also a gain in Hong Kong.

Another problem is that bumper deals are increasingly being handled by more banks, giving each one
a smaller slice of the pie.
An expected $6 billion Hong Kong initial public offering by WH Group Ltd. will have 28 underwriters,
surpassing the record held by Chinese brokerage China Galaxy Securities Co., which hired 21 banks
to arrange a $1.1 billion offering in May 2013.

Still, even as fees remain subdued, some banks are planning modest growth. France's Societe
Generale SA wants to expand its credit and debt capital markets business across the Asian-Pacific
region and will also expand its energy and natural-resources finance operation in Southeast Asia.

U.S. investment bank Jefferies Group LLC is also considering expanding in Southeast Asia.
And some believe the buoyancy in equity capital markets, especially in Hong Kong and China,
means the flow of deals will gather pace. "If markets hold up, there is an enormous amount of volume
to come," said Russell Julius, head of banking for the Asian-Pacific region at HSBC.
