INDEPENDENT dairy processor United Dairy Power (UDP) is about to be sold or partially sold.
Rumours of an impending sale have circulated for some time, with a Chinese company said to
be interested.

Founder and chief executive Tony Esposito could not be contacted yesterday, but he had earlier
told Fairfax that a sale or partial sale was imminent.

Mr Esposito said he has had "interest from everywhere" including Australia, New Zealand and
China, but he would not name the interested parties, saying only that a deal may be announced
in days or weeks.

UDP has processing facilities at Jervois and Murray Bridge in South Australia and Poowong and
Shepparton in Victoria.

It has about 50 suppliers in the south-west.
UDP is wholly owned by Mr Esposito who founded the company in 1999, initially as a milk
broker before buying established processing facilities.
Today it processes about 300 million litres from its own suppliers plus additional volume bought
from rivals.
It makes cheeses, including the Caboolture brand, as well as fresh milk and a variety of other
products for the domestic market.
