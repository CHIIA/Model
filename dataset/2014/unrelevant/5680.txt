Frasers Centrepoint has signalled it may carve off assets from the recently acquired Australand
Property Group into its Singapore-based commercial real estate investment trust while spinning off
a new industrial fund in that market.

The speedy announcement on the future of the Australian business may surprise analysts as Frasers
had not previously indicated its interest in so quickly spinning off parts of Australand’s $3 billion office
and industrial portfolio.

Frasers Centrepoint chief executive Lim Ee Seng said at a briefing at the group’s annual results
yesterday that the group could shift some of the old Australand properties into its Singapore REIT.
Frasers Commercial Trust, which owns other Australian office assets, has first right of refusal over
the assets while those deemed non-core may be sold off. He added that the group may spin off the
Australand industrial properties into a separate REIT, Bloomberg reported.

Frasers this month appointed former Australand managing director Bob Johnston as the head of its
Australian property business replacing Frasers Property Australia chief Guy Pahor.

The changes in the top echelons of Fraser’s Australian arm sparked speculation the Australand
business would be broken up, with the possibility its commercial or industrial business would be
spun off into a new Australian listed trust.

But at the time of Mr Johnson’s appointment, many analysts doubted whether Frasers had such
plans.

Frasers, controlled by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, acquired Australand last month on
completion of a $2.6bn takeover.

Frasers outbid local giant Stockland in a takeover battle.

“With Australand, we now have two strong legs in Singapore and Australia, core markets where we
have platforms with scale and depth,” Mr Lim said.“We will continue to grow and strengthen our
Singapore and Australia legs, even as we look at opportunities over the medium term to strengthen
our third leg of China.”
