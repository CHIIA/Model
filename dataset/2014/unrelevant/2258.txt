The S&P/ASX200 closed down 69.7 points to 5358.9 on average volume worth $3.9 billion. There were
293 issues higher and 681 down. The SPI Futures is down 75 points to 5345, volume unavailable,
deepest apologies.

Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 4 points to 3.97%. The $A is at 93.95US c, about in line with
Saturday levels.

*The banks contributed 23.7 negative points to the index, insurers have contributed 3.7 negative points,
resources have contributed 4.9 negative points, property trusts have contributed 1 negative point,
retailers + Food have contributed 4.2 negative points. Telstra was Neutral.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures is down 80 points to 13,980 points, Shanghai CSI physical is down
4.07 points to 2126.47, Hang Seng futures is up 52 points to 23,047 points. S&P futures is down 2.5
points to 1809.20, Nasdaq futures is down 3 points to 3441 points. Dow futures is down 22 points to5,959
after being down 120 points at midday, our time.
Gold futures are up $7.60 to 41326.60. Crude futures have gained 50c to $104.24.

Our market was down in the mid 20's for most of the morning, plunging late morning after the Dow futures
fell 120 points. Although the Dow futures recovered into our close, our market plunged sharply in the
afternoon.

Best guess is with the market falling below the uptrend line, stop losses were triggered and technical
trading dominated. The $A is steady at 93.95US c.

Meanwhile, although not reflected in afternoon trading (a further possible indication that technical traders
were dominating the market) China's purchase of the Las Bambas copper mine in Peru for $6 billion -
the price GlencoreXstrata paid for Chinese approval of their merger - announced earlier today - plus an
agreement to supply a minimum amount of copper to China for 8 years is very likely to be a negative for
our copper miners.

"Support is at 5390, resistance at 5475. I will call us down 25 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "With regard to the S&P 500 uptrend that began in June
2012, if you draw that trend line, it is still in tact, just.

"1800 is probably the base of that trend line. Just keep an eye on that.

"What we have seen over the last month is a bit of consolidation on the S&P. We did see a new high, but
that could not hold - the head and shoulders broke from the high of 1980 last week, which is technically
short term bearish.

"The consolidation range over the last couple of months has also broken. The 20 day moving average is
starting to trend down as well.

Page245of259©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The long term uptrend does remain in tact, but keep an eye on 1800.

"Nasdaq has a different set up to the S&P 500. The top was formed at the start of March. It has pretty
much been in downtrend since March 21. The confirmed downtrend has gathered a lot of acceleration
with the 20 day moving average having crossed below the 50 day moving average last week.

"The level to watch is 4,000 where it basically closed on Friday. A break would probably see it head down
to the next level of support at 3900.
"With regard to the Chinese market, a key level of support at 2000 has continued to hold. It is good to see
the Chinese market last week break 2100. It has gathered quite a bit of momentum since that break. That
market looks quite bullish with the 20 day moving average having crossed back over and above the 50
day moving average. "2160 is resistance, support is at 2080. It is short term bullish there.
"On gold, there has been a short term break of the long term downtrend for gold, to around the $1390
level.
"Gold is in no man's land at present. It is short term neutral. There were some good movements last week
- a test of $1280 on three different days confirmed the support level there. Resistance now will be around
$1345 for gold. It is short term neutral, could go in either direction from here.

"The 20 day moving average is still in downtrend, we need to see $1325 broken .

*The XJO was interesting last week and over the last couple of weeks, de-coupling a bit from the US. after
the sell off in March there is good support at 5300. It has been in a short term uptrend from March 24. The
20 day moving average is still trending upwards along with the 50 day and will be close to testing the
uptrend, probably today.

"Support is at 5390, resistance at 5475.

"For the week keep an eye on the 5395 level where the 20 day is sitting at this moment and where we had
good support last week.

"Intra day levels are 5415 and then 5395. Resistance is probably 5435 for the day.

"Given the price action in the US and the US futures opening down 60 points this morning, I will call us
down 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 52.2 points to 5428.6 on Friday.

NEWS OF THE DAY

Changes in substantials reported April 9, 10 and 11 posted separately.
China buys Glencore's Las Bambas copper mine for $6bn/agrees Xstrata merger
BBC News reports a Chinese consortium is buying GlencoreXstrata's copper mine in Peru in a $6bn
(&#163;3.6bn) all-cash deal, marking one of China's largest mining acquisitions.
The consortium is led by MMG Limited and includes China's Citic Metal.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals but all parties expect the deal to be done by the end of
September.
Analysts expect Glencore to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt.
The mine is expected to produce more than 450,000 tonnes of copper a year in its first five years.
China agrees Xstrata merger
China has approved the merger of commodities trader Glencore and mining groupXstrata, clearing the
final big hurdle in completion of the deal.
The nod came after Glencore agreed to sell its stake in Xstrata's copper mining project in Peru to a
buyer approved by Chinese authorities, BBC News reported..
GlencoreXstrata also agreed to supply a minimum volume of copper concentrate to China for a period of
eight years.
Our add: May affect the amount of copper China buys from Australia in due course.
China buys stake in House of Fraser in London (Harrod's)
BBC News reports UK department store chain House of Fraser has sold a majority stake in its business
to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a &#163;480m deal.
The acquisition - China's largest foreign retail investment - gives Sanpower an 89% share in the
company.
Sanpower said it wanted to expand the "iconic heritage brand" overseas, especially in China.

House of Fraser called the deal an "extremely exciting chapter" in its 165-year history.

IPCC's third and final report on Climate Change

BBC News reports (slightly abridged and italics by us) In their 'summary for policymakers' members of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say the world must rapidly move away from
carbon-intensive fuels. Total anthropogenic GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions have continued to increase
over 1970 to 2010 with larger decadal increases toward the end of this period

Mitigation must happen and happen fast against a background of fast-rising CO2 emissions. Greenhouse
gas releases were higher between 2000 and 2010 than they have ever been in human history, and the

Page247of259©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.global economic crisis produced only a temporary lull in emissions. In addition, about half of all the carbon
that humans have pumped into the atmosphere since 1750 has been emitted in the past 40 years.

Second, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of
total greenhouse gas emissions from 1979 to 2010. This brings us to another take-home message of this
report - that experts believe there needs to be a huge shift towards clean energy and away from
carbon-intensive energy sources if we are to head off the worst effects of global warming.

The panel says that, driven by a global increase in population and economic activity, global surface
temperature increases will be between 3.7C and 4.8C in 2100 if no new action is taken.
The figure of 450 parts per million (ppm) concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is about the limit we
must not exceed in order to keep temperature change under 2C (3.6F) by the end of this century. The 2C
target was agreed by the UN as a way of avoiding dangerous changes in the climate.

But keeping greenhouse emissions under 450ppm by 2100 will be an uphill struggle. It will involve major
changes to the way the world gets its energy - requiring a tripling or quadrupling of the share of
low-carbon energy from renewables such as solar and wind, nuclear energy or other less polluting
options. It will also necessitate changes in the way we use land, including reforestation - trees absorb
CO2 and are therefore a natural 'sink" for this greenhouse gas.

The message from the IPCC is that despite the scale of the challenge, the changes required are within our
grasp and even offer opportunities (renewables could offer energy security, preventing access to fossil
fuel supplies being used as a political weapon).
If the world does overshoot the 450ppm limit, technologies such as Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and
Storage (Beccs) might have to be deployed widely. But the panel indicates which scenario would be
preferable, pointing out: "The availability and scale of these and other carbon dioxide removal (CDR)
technologies and methods are uncertain," and, it adds "associated with challenges and risks'.

Since AR4 [the IPCC's previous assessment report in 2007], many RE technologies have demonstrated
substantial performance improvements and cost reductions, and a growing number of RE (renewable
energy) technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant scale

The economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on the assumptions used in simulations and the
technologies deployed. Scenarios that keep atmospheric concentrations of CO2 under 450ppm by 2100
are associated with losses in global consumption (economic activity) of 1% to 4% in 2030, for example.

However, the report warns that if mitigation steps are delayed, or if access to technologies such as
Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (Beccs) is limited for any reason, the costs of mitigation will
increase still further in the medium to long term.

And there are likely to be many other benefits from steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in addition
to those related to curbing global warming. The benefits include a reduction in air pollution, which causes
millions of premature deaths worldwide each year. Another is energy security - clean energy sources
can help reduce our dependence on other countries for supplies of gas, for example.

The report backs the use of gas in the switch to a low-carbon economy. It says that efficient natural gas
power generation could act as a "bridge technology", if its use is phased out in the second half of this
century.
