5 YEARS FROM ITS POST NOV 2007 LOWS - A FIBONACCI NUMBER

Our market has risen strongly on our eco numbers, stronger than expected with the balance of trade
surprising on the positive and retail sales also higher, adding to a slightly higher GDP number for the
quarter yesterday.

There is no standout sector currently.

(Gerald Stanley, a Fibonacci chartist adds that the 5 year anniversary could be significant and may
indicate a top of some kind).

"High will be 5433. Low will be 5410 .. close at 5431, down 15.2 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the SPI futures contract down 12 points. So long as our market does not trace out a new rally high this
week, the weight of evidence suggests we will witness a decline back to 5180 to 5250 points over the next
few weeks, which would be consistent with seasonal weakness this time of year. A new high today or
tomorrow however jeopardises this thesis.

"While there are a number of red flags casting long shadows over the market, price momentum remains
favourable on a near term basis so we watch with keen interest the next few days.

"The high will be 5453. The low will be 5410. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5431, down 15.2 points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 46 points to 5446.2 last evening.

Balance of trade surprises on the upside

Page134of251©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The ABS reported in trend terms, the balance on goods and services was a surplus of $986m in January
2014, an increase of $389m (65%) on the surplus in December 2013.

In seasonally adjusted terms, the balance on goods and services was a surplus of $1,433m in January
2014, an increase of $842m (142%) on the surplus in December 2013.

In seasonally adjusted terms, goods and services credits rose $1,068m (4%) to $29,759m. Non-rural
goods rose $536m (3%), non-monetary gold rose $425m (44%) and rural goods rose $178m (5%). Net
exports of goods under merchanting fell $8m (18%). Services credits fell $63m (1%).

23.4 million people. That compares favourably with per capita GDP in the United States of $53,823.
Adding most to growth was international trade as the mountains of money spent on mining expansions

repayment over the next three years.

Outlook
The company said the markets across all its operating business activities continue to be very challenging.
It has secured lower work for the Engineering & Construction Division than previously envisaged and
where awarded had experienced commencement delays. There are however industry expectations for an
improvement in 2015 driven by a need to replenish coal reserves to meet market demand.

In the UK, subsidiary Cuadrilla has announced the proposed location for two new exploration sites for
shale gas in Lancashire. Centrica's farm in to the Bowland Prospect was completed in June 2013 with
Centrica committing to fund the next 60 million pound expenditure on Bowland, with Lucas effectively
having a free carry until the 60 million pound has been expended expected by the late 2nd quarter of

*BIT: BIT 225 HIV/HCV trial patients virus free at six months
Biotron Ltd announced additional interim positive data from a key phase 2 trial of its lead antiviral drug
BIT225, in patients co-infected with HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Analysis of blood samples from patients indicated that all of the HCV genotype 3 patients completing
treatment are virus free at the 24 week (6 month) time point.

This extends previous data that showed patients with undetectable virus levels at 12 weeks.

Response to treatment at this time point is generally a good indication of final outcome at 48 weeks.
Preliminary data from patients who have completed 48 weeks of treatment indicate that they remain virus
free t this key time point.

Managing director Dr Michelle Miller said in the report, "This 24 week data further validates the efficacy of
BIT225 as a potential new therapy for HCV and in particular for this difficult to treat group of HIV/HCV
co-infected patients who typically have more serious HCV infection and lower response rates to treatment
with existing standard therapies.

In vitro assays have shown that BIT225 has pan-genotypic activity, apart from the genotype 1 variant of
the virus, the most common in Western populations, the data extended the company's clinical data
portfolio to include genotype 3, endemic in south-east Asia.

Our Week's Special dated January 13 2012. BIT was trading at 14.5c.
Please note: We have held a minute stake in BIT since then.
