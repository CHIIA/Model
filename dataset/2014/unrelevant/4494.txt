More window dressing than a David Jones store at Xmas! A surprisingly firm day today mainly on the
back of the banking sector as the big four led us out of the wilderness. Well ,actually not that surprising
given it is quarter end, quiet and a bit of pushing never hurt anyone's performance right? Macquarie
Group Limited (A$57.65, +0.5%) continued to find friends as did K2 Asset Management Holdings Ltd
(A$0.72, unch),Henderson Group PLC. (A$4.68, +2.2%) and Platinum Asset Management Limited
(A$7.47, +3.0%). Insurers were mixed with QBE Insurance Group Limited (A$12.65, -0.8%) in the dog
house although others were mildly better. After a cautious start at the end of the quarter, buyers stepped
in to tickle things along. In the final analysis we closed at 5367 up 17 points for a weekly gain of a huge 27
points! For the year we are up 17 points. Wow! US is square til tonight's move up.

Miners also rallied last night as Chinese stimulus is seen rolling down the track, Iron ore going a tad
higher helped too with BHP Billiton Limited (A$36.14, +0.4%) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (A$5.34,
+1.5%) putting in the hard yards as did Alumina Limited (A$1.20, +5.3%) following a nearly 7% rise in
Alcoa in the US last night on LME warehouse rule changes.
Energy stocks were mixed with Woodside Petroleum Limited (A$38.65, +0.6%) having a whale of a time
on the back of their Leviathan purchase in Israel but Karoon Gas Australia Limited (A$2.56, -0.4%)
continued to look awful. AWE Limited (A$1.495, +2.0%) also doing well as were Beach Energy Limited
(A$1.68, +1.2%) and Drillsearch Energy Limited (A$1.68, +6.3%)

Meanwhile in widget land, building stocks did well. Csr Limited (A$3.40, +2.4%),James Hardie Industries
PLC (A$14.23, +1.1%),Boral Limited (A$5.61, +0.7%) but Brickworks Limited (A$14.25, -0.1%)(missed
out despite Charlie giving them a huge wrap!).Healthcare stocks better led by Sigma Pharmaceuticals
Limited (A$0.67, +4.7%),Ramsay Health Care Limited (A$47.84, +0.7%) and Greencross Limited (A$8.11,
+1.4%) but Csl Limited (A$69.85, -1.0%) suffered from clotting as their biggest US rival announced plans
to split.

The media landscape was a bit better and Ten Network Holdings Limited (A$0.27, unch) celebrated
Lachlan going off to join dad in the Big Apple, whilst #NNC# and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (A$33.39,
-1.9%) fell. Recent listing NEC firmed as did Seven West Media Limited (A$1.93, +1.3%).

Tomorrow's News Today

Sydneysiders are flooding the property market with more than 2500 properties up for auction in the three
weeks before the Easter and Anzac Day holidays. Taking advantage of the bubble? In past peaks the
ratio of average dwelling prices divided by average disposable incomes per family is 4.5 times. It was that
in 2006 and 2010 and at present is around 4.4 as wage growth lags housing prices in a big way. Sydney
up nearly 16% this year.

Facebook has splurged $2bn on buying Oculus Rift, the world's first really viable virtual reality headset.
Most of these things make you feel sick and do we really want to like in 3D in a virtual world. Maybe they
are going to make a virtual world where you can talk to your friends face to face and interact in real time
as if you were there. Don't we have something like that already? Good luck with that Facebook. Top of the
market stuff? Desperation?

Good to see the IMF bailing out Ukraine. Shame most of the money will go to Russian State Banks and
Hedge funds like Franklin Templeton which alone held $US7.3 billion of Ukrainian bonds at the end of
2013. Everyone looked at them as a one way bet being such a strategic asset they could never let it fail.
Looks like they got it right! Still the Russian's have upped the gas price by 50%. Short and curlies
anyone?

Can you hear the air escaping. Internet stocks have been hit hard in the last few weeks and it continues
with Chinese Tencent which has fallen more than 17 % since the start of February, taking its market
capitalisation down from $152bn to $126bn.Candy Crush maker King has been named as the worst float
of 2014 so far. Still a way to go!
Giant US retailer Wal-Mart is suing credit card firm Visa for $5bn , alleging that Visa worked with large
banks to fix the price of transaction fees it charged to Wal-Mart. No, really?
A dramatic surge in interest from wealthy Chinese is threatening to overwhelm a U.S. program offering
investors green cards in exchange for cash. The number of applicants is now so huge that the
government may run out of permits. Any foreigner willing to commit at least $500,000 and create 10 jobs
in America can apply for an investor immigrant visa. Chinese nationals account for more than 80% of
visas issued, compared to just 13% a decade ago.

And thought for the day. The world's 10 bestselling prescription drugs raked in $75.6bn of sales last year,
led by Humira, which treats rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease was the world's top seller
for the second year running.
