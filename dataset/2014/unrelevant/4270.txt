aving sealed off a pay row, BG Group has capped a torrid Hend to the year with the $5 billion sale of
a gas pipeline in Queensland, Australia, that will free up funds for reinvestment (Nic Fildes writes).
The oil and gas group has sold the 543km pipeline to APA Group, an Australian infrastructure
investor. The pipeline connects the British company's plant in Chinchilla to its liquefied natural gas
terminal in Gladstone, above. BG Group offloaded a pipeline in the North Sea in June for nearly $1
billion.

The funds will be used to reduce debt, which will help to free up resources for Helge Lund, the
incoming chief executive, to invest in new PROJECTs.
BG Group dropped a one-off share award worth £12 million for Mr Lund this month to appease angry
investors.
