BIS warns ultra low rates prolonged may create the situation they seek to prevent

BBC News reports the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that ultra-low interest rates
have lulled governments and markets "into a false sense of security".

The Basel-based organisation - usually dubbed the "central banks' central bank" - urged policy makers to
begin to normalise rates.

"The risk of normalising too late and too gradually should not be underestimated," the BIS said.

"Overall, it is hard to avoid the sense of a puzzling disconnect between the markets' buoyancy and
underlying economic developments globally," the BIS said in its annual report.

It said that low interest rates had helped increase demand for higher risk investments on stock markets as
well as in property and corporate bonds markets.

While global growth has improved, the BIS said it was still below its pre-crisis levels.

"Growth has disappointed even as financial markets have roared: The transmission chain seems to be
badly impaired," the BIS said.

And it warned that taking too long to do this could have potentially damaging consequences, by
encouraging investors to take too much risk.

Page277of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Over time, policies lose their effectiveness and may end up fostering the very conditions they seek to
prevent," it said.

"The predominant risk is that central banks will find themselves behind the curve, exiting too late or too
slowly," it added.

The BIS was founded in 1930 and is the world's oldest international financial institution.

Its 60-strong membership includes the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the US Federal
Reserve, the People's Bank of China and the Bank of Japan.

In the Ukraine

BBC News reports Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has extended a week-long ceasefire with
pro-Russian separatists in the east for another three days.

He said he was hoping for progress on his peace plan.

Some rebel leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions said they would observe the truce, but others
rejected it.

Mr Poroshenko's announcement came hours after he had signed a landmark EU trade pact - the issue
that has been the trigger of the recent crisis.

He said it was a "historic" moment, but Russia warned of "consequences' and that Ukraine would split in
two.

Separatists in the east held talks on Friday with mediators, including Ukraine's former President Leonid
Kuchma, Moscow's ambassador in Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Mr Putin said: "There is bloodshed in the south-east Ukraine, humanitarian catastrophe, tens of
thousands of refugees have to look for shelter, on Russian territory."

Mr Poroshenko set out a 15-point peace plan on 20 June. It involves decentralising power and holding
early local and parliamentary elections.

It also proposes the creation of a 10km (six-mile) buffer zone on the Ukrainian-Russian border, and a safe
corridor for pro-Russian separatists to leave the conflict areas.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Russia the EU was prepared for "drastic measures' if there
was no speedy progress on Mr Poroshenko's peace plan.

French President Francois Hollande said more measures would be taken if there was no progress after
Sunday, when he and Mrs Merkel will speak to Mr Putin by phone.

Fighting is said to have continued in some areas of eastern Ukraine despite the ceasefire.

In Iraq

US armed drones are now flying over Iraq. They bombed what turned out to be an empty house. ISIS (the
Independent State of Iraq and Syria (actual word used is Levant, which may mean Syria) is rapidly
advancing, they are now also in Baghdad. Syria and Iran may join with the US as the entire region
becomes alarmed for their own countries.

*Foreign Secretary William Hague says all sides in Iraq must work together to face a 'lethal and mortal
threat' to their country.

Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, he ruled out any UK military intervention.

(Comprehensive reports on BBC News).

"The Age" adds, "ISIS, or ISIL has declared The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group has
called on all other related Sunni factions, including al-Qaeda, to pledge their allegiance to the new state,
which it says stretches from Aleppo in Syria to Diyala in Iraq.

In a statement distributed online on Sunday – the newly-minted Islamic State declared its chief Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi as "the caliph" and "leader for Muslims everywhere". Baghdadi is thought to be the leader
and strategic thinker behind ISIL.

Page278of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The group’s statement – translated from Arabic into English, French, Russian and German – made it clear
it would perceive any group that failed to pledge allegiance an enemy of Islam,” Mr Lister said.

Released on the first day of the holy fasting month of Ramadan, the statement establishing a caliphate, a
system of rule that ended nearly 100 years ago with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, reads: “Here the flag
of the Islamic State … rises and flutters. Its shade covers land from Aleppo [Syria] and Diyala [Iraq].

“The infidels are disgraced. The Sunnis are masters and are esteemed. The people of heresy are
humiliated. The Sharia penalties are implemented, all of them.

“The front lines are defended, crosses and graves demolished. Governors and judges have been
appointed, a tax has been enforced and courts will resolve disputes and complaints.”

ISIL, also known as ISIS, already controls large swathes of northern Iraq after a sustained assault which
began with the overthrow of Iraqi control of the country’s second largest city of Mosul, near the Syrian
border, on June 9.

*RMD: "ResMed shares ripe for a fall

The broker said while over a remarkable two decades Resmed has grown sales at a double digit annual
rate by focusing on one thing" home medical gear to treat sleepers' breathing problems.

"Even with the $52 shares near their all time high, Resmed trades at about 19x the average estimate for
next year's earnings.

"But Resmed bulls had better sleep with an eye open. March sales reportedly were aided by a quarter
end deal with a large customer while profit was boosted by noncash accruals. And the cost cutters are far
from finished with the home medical industry.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is contemplating further controls on the utilization and
pricing of products like CPAP.

Page279of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.On the table are proposals to require prior approval for CPAP treatment and to bundle all payments into a
fixed monthly fee per patient - measures that have successfully curbed the overuse of costly drugs in
kidney dialysis. if such economies end up affecting ResMed's profit growth, the stock could settle to a
market multiple, which would send the share price down by at least 15%" Barron's reported.
