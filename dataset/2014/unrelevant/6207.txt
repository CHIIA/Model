Harry Triguboff 's Meriton Group has pulled off its biggest and most ambitious purchase to date,
snapping up a site in Sydney that will be home to an $800 million-plus apartment project.

Meriton now has the most apartments in its pipeline in history, with more than 14,000 units. It is a
clear vote of confidence in Australia and more specifically Sydney's, housing market.

DEXUS Property Groupsold the site to Meriton for $190 million, the most Mr Triguboff's company
has ever spent. More than 1000 apartments will be built at the 4.9-hectare site.
The business park, at 5-13 Rosebery Avenue and 25-55 Rothschild Avenue in the suburb of
Rosebery, was one of the assets DEXUS flagged as having residential conversion potential at the
beginning of the year. It had a book value of about $100 million.
Meriton Acquisitions Manager Angelo Mantsis called the Rosebery asset an "interesting site".

"We've built next to it so we have experience in the area. We believe that what we paid is the true
value. To buy land is not difficult – to build is more difficult. We plan to settle in a year and start
building Stage 1 then."

JLL's Michael Fenton , Sam Brewer and Blair Peterken brokered the off-market deal on behalf of
DEXUS.
The site is zoned residential with a GFA of 90,000 square metres.
Demand for residential housing has continued to grow over 2014 and off-the-plan sales of
apartments have been selling out in hours. Many offshore groups have been paying large amounts
of money to secure residential sites and take advantage of the conditions.

Mr Trigiboff is one Sydney developer who can compete with the eye-watering prices offshore
developers have paid for inner-Sydney sites. Groups such as Far East Consortium and Greenland
have elbowed out other groups with their capacity to pay for sites.

This year alone Meriton has spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying up future projects.

The investments, which have mainly been in Sydney's suburbs, have been matched by strong off
the plan sales from its existing portfolio. The Macquarie Residences in Sydney's North Ryde, for
example, sold all 213 apartments prior to its launch in June.
In May, Meriton spent about $40 million on another site in Sydney's Mascot. This followed hot on
the heels of the purchase of 234 Sussex Street in the Sydney CBD for about $60 million.

Parramatta, which sold to a Chinese buyer for $120 million. Mr Triguboff has called for Australian
rules for offshore developers to be liberalised to allow more capital to flow into the country.
