HONG KONG, May 28 (Reuters) - China's state-owned Bright Food (Group) Co Ltd is seeking a
syndicated loan of up to $800 million to back its acquisition of a majority stake in Israel's largest food
companyTnuva, banking sources said.
Bright Foods said that it would buy 56 percent of dairy firmTnuva, Israel's largest food company, from
private equity house Apax Partners on May 22 in a deal that shareholder Mivtach Shamir Holdings said
valued the dairy company at about $2.5 billion.

Bright Foods' deal follows similar acquisition loans for Chinese state-owned companies COFCO Corp,
China's largest grain trader, and steel producer Baosteel Group Corp.

Bright Food was not immediately available for comment.
The Chinese state-owned companies are raising syndicated US dollar-denominated loans in Hong
Kong after tightening Chinese liquidity in 2013 made internationally-syndicated offshore loans cheaper
than onshore loans.
State-owned Chinese companies have raised $2.6 billion of loans so far this year, with another $11
billion of deals in the pipeline, giving a total of $13.6 billion for the year to date, compared to a total of
$17 billion of loans in 2013.
COFCO Corp. is currently in the market with a $3.2 billion acquisition loan to back its purchase of
Noble Group Ltd's agribusiness unit and repay a shareholder loan.
Baosteel Group Corp is also seeking financing proposals for a loan of around $554 million equivalent
in Australian dollars to to fund its takeover bid for Australian explorer Aquila Resources Ltd

SEEKING PROPOSALS
Bright Food has asked banks to send in proposals for one or three-year loans of up to $800 million
equivalent in euros with bullet repayment.
The company sent out invitations to banks on Tuesday and has asked for indicative proposals within 10
working days, sources said.
Best known for its cottage cheese, Tel Aviv-based Tnuva had 2013 revenue of 7.17bn shekels ($2.05
billion) from the sales of a range of cheeses, milk, yoghurt, meat and eggs.
Bright Food will pay Apax slightly less than $1 billion in cash for its 56 percent stake and will assume
Apax's share of bank loans totalling 1.9 billion shekels, Reuters reported.
Bright Food's new acquisition loan is expected to have similar documentation to an $850 million loan
that the company raised un October 2012 to finance its acquisition of a majority stake in British cereal
maker Weetabix.

Bank, HSBC, National Australia Bank, Rabobank and RBS, and a $300 million, one-year bridge loan to
a bond issue that was provided by HSBC, Rabobank and RBS.

The three-year loan had all-in pricing of 230 basis points (bps) and the one-year bridge loan paid up to
150bps.
