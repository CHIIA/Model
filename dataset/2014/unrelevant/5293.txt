The company is focusing on enhanced advertising products
CLASSIFIED advertising business REA Group continues to benefit from a retooled commercial
strategy, with an expanded range of advertising products driving a net profit increase of 37 per cent.

The operator of the nation’s No 1 property website, realestate.com.au, delivered a net profit of
$149.9 million.

Revenue increased 30 per cent to $437.5m compared to the previous corresponding period in the
year ending June 30.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation spiked 37 per cent to $225.1m.

A final dividend of 35c per share, fully franked, will be paid, bringing the total dividend for the year to
57c, fully franked.

This represents a 37 per cent increase on the 2013 total dividend. The final dividend will be paid on
September 25.

Shares in REA lost ground, declining 8.65 per cent, or $4.05, to $42.78. The fall comes as
high-growth stocks with a high price-earnings ratio have been marked down by investors.

The result was driven by a 69 per cent surge in revenue from listing depth products, which are
enhanced advertising products created for real estate agents to advertise properties.

REA has deliberately pulled away from a subscription model to focus on listing depth products.
The idea is to reduce the barrier of entry for a real estate agent to list with the group’s property
portals because the model removes the fixed cost the agent has to bear to list a property.
The commercial business is also tracking well, with revenues up 29 per cent, and media display
improving 25 per cent.
“We’re seeing growth in the three core parts of our residential business in Australia,” interim chief
executive Peter Tonagh said.

“We certainly expect to see continued growth in depth, and continued declines in subscription.” REA
is well positioned for strong future earnings growth after extending its lead over its nearest
competitor, Fairfax Media’s Domain.
The company’s main website now generates 3.1 times the monthly website traffic of Domain, and
accounts for 82 per cent of the time spent on real estate portals in Australia.
REA announced it made a profit after tax of $20m-$22m on the sale of a minority interest in a
company it declined to name.

continues to expand its overseas operations.
REA recently acquired a substantial shareholding in iProperty Group, which owns online property
advertising operations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.“It gives us a
very good overview of those markets; we can learn more about them and we’re anticipating growth,”
Mr Tonagh said.
