China imported 47.08 million mt of iron ore from Australia in August, down a significant 15% on the
month, data released Tuesday by the General Administration of Customs showed.
Year on year, however, there was a 35% growth in China's Australian ore imports, a general trend
observed all year as miners have been ramping up on production.

Sources said the month on month fall follows an increase in the number of countries importing
Australian iron ore as spot prices have plummeted to levels low enough to make buying conducive,
leading to some divergence in Australian material away from China. Chinese buyers still purchase the
majority of iron ore mined from Australia because of the huge steelmaking industry in the country and
the active trading network that exists there.

"We've started observing there are more countries that have started to buy more Australian material as
prices are now low enough for buyers there to accept, so Australian miners have started to send more
cargoes to countries like India," a steelmaker in central China said.
Platts assessed the 62% Fe Iron Ore Index at $80.50/dmt CFR North China Tuesday. This means the
assessment has lost $13/dmt, or 14%, since the beginning of August.
Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, for instance, has been selling more spot cargoes of its flagship
Pilbara Blend fines and lump into India this year. Rebecca Murphy, a Perth-based spokeswoman for the
miner, told Platts in mid-July they had been selling some lump cargoes to Indian buyers, but would not
comment on "future sales" of such cargoes.

Rio Tinto last sold 62% Fe PB lump at $95/dmt CFR India on September 19, for a 65,000-mt cargo
loading October 13-23. On August 27, it also sold 170,000 mt of 61% Fe PB fines at $90/dmt CFR India,
for a cargo that was to have loaded September 11-20.

For Indian steelmakers, the shutdown of domestic mines has also severely impacted their ability to rely
on domestic material, leading tp more imports. For example, 26 iron ore mines in India's Odisha state
were ordered to cease production in May, including seven of Tata Steel's captive mines, pending
reviews of their leases.
China's iron ore imports from Brazil, second only to Australia in terms of ore volumes imported, also
decreased on the month by 5% to 13.48 million mt in August. Market sources also earlier said more
Brazilian material was finding its way into India as well, with miners like Vale and Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) starting to send more material there. China's August imports from Brazil
remained largely rangebound on the year, losing only 0.8% in volume.
China imported a total of 74.88 million mt of iron ore in August, down 9% from the 82.52 million mt
imported in July, but up 9% on the year.

in August, down 64% from the same period last year and 32% lower than July, as volume from Australia
dwindled, according to the customs data. Australia, the largest exporter to China, saw exports decline
55% year on year, and dip 23% month on month, to 1.60 million mt.
Mongolia retained its market position as the second biggest supplier, shipping 1.19 million mt of coal to
China in August, rising 30% compared to a year ago, and 6% higher than July.
Russia leapfrogged Canada to third place, shipping 0.43 million mt in July, up 18.6% from the month
before and a 30% gain year on year. Canada exported 406,042 mt in August, down from 755,819 mt in
July, and nearly half the volume from a year ago. The US shipped 204,077 mt of coking coal to China,
down from 826,333 mt in August last year.
China's seaborne shipments over January-August totaled 39.92 million mt, falling 16.0% from 47.50
million mt a year earlier.
