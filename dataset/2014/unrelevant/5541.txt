GOODMAN SYDNEY, May 16 AAP - One of Australia's largest food companies is the target of a
sweetened $1.37 billion dollar takeover offer from two Asian firms.
Goodman Fielder, which makes and sells bread, biscuits, sauces spreads and oils, has told the market
it is considering the new bid, which was made on Thursday.

The company, which owns the Helga's, MeadowLea, Vogel's and Olive Grove brands, recently
rejected a $1.27 billion takeover offer from Singapore-based agribusiness Wilmar International and
Hong Kong investment firm First Pacific Company.

The two suitors have now increased their offer, from 65 cents per Goodman Fielder share to 70 cents
per share.

The companies also said they would go no higher.

Goodman Fielder has been given until 2000 AEST on Friday to support the new offer, and allow Wilmar
and First Pacific to rights to perform due diligence on the food company.

The support of two of Goodman Fielder's major shareholders has already been secured by the Asian
firms, with Perpetual and Ellerston Capital to sell their combined 4.8 per cent of stock in Goodman
Fielder if the board accepts the offer.
First Pacific currently holds a 10.1 per cent stake in Goodman Fielder.

Shares in Goodman Fielder have been halted from trade, and were last valued at 67.25 cents.
