Mining billionaireAndrew Forrest has emerged as the potential new owner of WA’s biggest single
milk producer as he weighs up more investment in farming and food processing.
It is understood Mr Forrest’s Minderoo Group recently cast an eye over both Lactanz Dairies, near
Scott River in the South West, and the Brownes dairy processing plant in Balcatta.

Mr Forrest’s interest in the local assets was revealed as WA-based livestock exporter Wellard
celebrated a $100 million deal to supply 22,500 dairy cattle to the Sri Lankan Department of
Economic Development.

Wellard will source Friesian Jersey-cross heifers from around Australia and ship them to Sri Lanka
over the next two years.

The Wellard deal, financed by Rabobank and backed by Australia’s Export Finance Investment
Corporation, includes management and veterinary support.
Wellard will also set up a farm and build a dairy as Sri Lanka builds on the success of earlier
consignments of 2000 cattle.

Lactanz, which has no link to the Wellard deal, boasts about 4000 milking cows and 1500 rising
heifers.
It churns out about 16 million litres of milk a year under a supply contract with Brownes, which
expires at the end of June.

In the hands of receivers Ferrier Hodgson for more than 14 months, Lactanz is being marketed by
CBRE for about $30 million.

Expressions of interest close tomorrow, with Minderoo believed to be one of a number of interested
parties.
The others include Chinese, Indonesian and Middle East interests.
Local processors Brownes, Harvey Fresh and Lion are also keeping a close eye on the sale as
they battle for milk supply in WA.

Brownes owner Archer Capital has been trying to sell off part or all of the WA processor.
The private equity fund has made no official comment on a sale process which values Brownes at
more than $200 million.

Industry analysts said securing Lactanz could provide Mr Forrest with a significant bargaining chip
in negotiations on the future of Brownes.

about $45 million in May.

The Sri Lanka deal is a boost for Wellard after a fire on its flagship vessel the Ocean Drover this
month, which injured one crewman.
