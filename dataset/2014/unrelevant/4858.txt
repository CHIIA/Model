2240 GMT [Dow Jones] IOOF Holdings' (IFL.AU) near-term prospects are likely to be helped by
acquisition-led EPS growth and a dividend payout ratio at the top end of the company's guidance
range, says J.P. Morgan. It maintains an overweight recommendation in anticipation of strong earnings
growth into fiscal 2016 and a healthy fully-franked dividend yield. IOOF's FY14 underlying profit came in
slightly ahead of J.P. Morgan's forecast. Its price target rises to A$9.83/share from A$9.44. IFL last
traded at A$8.95. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2236 GMT [Dow Jones] While the Indonesian export ban on bauxite is likely to add pressure to prices of
the commodity over the medium term, J.P. Morgan notes the impact on China has yet to be felt
materially. "Further, lower electricity prices in some regions are helping to offset higher bauxite input
costs," the broker says. Input costs for alumina are typically more weighted to energy than bauxite. "On
this basis we believe there is a risk the 'cost push' theory to support higher alumina prices could be less
dramatic and take longer to play out," J.P. Morgan says. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2234 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter lifts QBE Insurance (QBE.AU) to buy from hold as its price target
rises toA$12/share from A$11.60, in line with its sum-of-the-parts valuation. "There is a growing
probability that macro, micro, technical and stock supply/demand are about to collide--in a good way--for
QBE," says director Charlie Aitken, adding it is the cheapest stock on a forward price/earnings-to-growth
ratio in the ASX 20. Aitken says QBE's underlying business is very sound, and the stock could again
trade at A$16 over the next few years. QBE last traded at A$11.27. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

10:34 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian markets may be under early pressure given weak offshore leads after
U.S. stocks finished mostly lower amid central bank speak and geopolitical turmoil, says Macquarie
Equities broker Brad Gordon. In New Zealand and Australia investors will remain focused on results. The
NZX-50 has opened 0.2% higher as investors are cheered by a positive result from retirement village
operator Metlifecare (MET.NZ). The stock is up 3.5% to NZ$4.50. Chorus (CNU.NZ) is flat at NZ$1.73 as
investors digest the result.(rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)
10:31 GMT [Dow Jones] Mining accommodation builder Fleetwood's (FWD.AU) challenges were
underscored last week when it foreshadowed a A$5 million asset impairment ahead of its FY14 results
due Aug. 26. With the mining sector showing little sign of rebounding, attention will shift to Fleetwood's
balance sheet. J.P.Morgan notes the company has a one-year debt facility with Westpac for A$73
million, which is expected to expire in December 2014. The broker expects Fleetwood will look to
refinance this facility and extend the duration in the coming months. "With net debt increasing to A$60
million at June 2014 and the majority of historical earnings skewed to a sector that will continue to put
pressure on suppliers in the near to medium term, we retain our underweight recommendation,"
J.P.Morgan says. FWD last traded at A$2.47. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2229 GMT [Dow Jones] U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's Jackson Hole speech over the
weekend has the attention of markets in early Asia trading. ANZ said in a note to clients that while it did
not signal a definitive Fed policy shift, Yellen's tone was more neutral, and should the U.S. data pulse
continue to show improvement, it opens up the possibility that the Fed signals the beginning of policy
tightening sooner than the market is currently pricing. This will support the U.S. dollar.

confidence it will deliver the US$18.5 billion GLNG project on time and budget, says J.P. Morgan, which
ups its price target on the oil company to A$15.82 from A$15.00 and keeps an overweight
recommendation. "Santos management checked all the boxes with this result," the broker says, noting
that it also posted a solid profit number and discovered more natural gas in the Browse Basin. Santos
was last at A$15.16. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2225 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian business investment has fallen for 5 of the last 7 quarters, driven by
lower resource investment, and another fall of around 4% is likely to be reported Thursday in the second
quarter, says RBC Capital Markets senior currency strategist Elsa Lignos. Ms. Lignos also expects some
downward revisions for estimates of future investment plans. Ms. Lignos adds that of particular
importance will be the outlook for non-resources investment, especially services, which has shown signs
of improvement although there are few signs of actual expenditure occurring in this sector at present.

10:15 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia is likely to revise its estimate of firms' expected nominal investment in
2014-15 modestly higher in data due Thursday, says Barclays. But it notes that this would be the net of
opposing forces, as the data will likely show a large upgrade to non-mining capex and a large
downgrade to mining investment. As a result, the data would still be consistent with a large fall in total
investment this fiscal year. "We see the risks around this outlook as tilted to the downside given separate
data show a big fall in engineering commencements, with the mining industry also providing more
negative feedback on the outlook to the Reserve Bank," Barclays says. "Given the latter feedback, we
suspect that the Reserve Bank will be paying more attention to the outlook for non-mining capex from
the survey."

2146 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/USD fell to 0.8336 from 0.8398 early in New Zealand after "an
Aussie-Kiwi option barrier was taken out," says ASB Head of Institutional Sales Tim Kelleher. AUD/NZD
now at 1.1131. The move was exacerbated by the fact that markets are fairly illiquid early Monday in
New Zealand and the NZD/USD "is already on its way back up," he says. NZD/USD now at 0.8355.

2128 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD will likely find some support in Asia after Yellen's "much-awaited
speech at Jackson hole turned out to be the fizzer many analysts had predicted, with her tone on the
labor market little different to that at her July Semi-Annual Testimony on Monetary Policy to Congress
and the more recent FOMC minutes," says ANZ Bank. It says the main interest was the distinct split
between the Fed's Yellen and the Bank of England's Broadbent "who sounded in no hurry to take any
tightening action." Also, the ECB's Draghi and the Bank of Japan's Kuroda, "who sounded ready to leap
out of the starting blocks and provide more stimulus to their economies as deflation threats intensify," say
ANZ Bank. Overall, "it certainly does highlight the world is not yet a 'business as usual' kind of place."

1943 GMT [Dow Jones] NZD/USD recovered some ground to open at 0.8396 after dipping on broad
USD strength following Fed Chair Yellen's address to the U.S. Jackson Hole meeting of global central
bankers on Friday night, says BNZ FX Strategist Kymberly Martin. Yellen "didn't come down firmly on
one side of the fence or the other with regards to the current state of the U.S. labor market," says Martin.
While Yellen reiterated "her view that there is still 'significant' slack in the labour market" she also
"referenced the possibility that 'increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than the
Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter.'" With little data on the day support is
around 0.8350 while resistance is eyed at 0.8440, says Martin. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com;
