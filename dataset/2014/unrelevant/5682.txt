0556 GMT [Dow Jones] AUD/USD hit a 2-month low of 0.9263, down from 0.9350 this morning as rate
cut speculation grew after unemployment surged to a 12-year high of 6.4% in July vs 6.1% expected. The
interest rate swaps market is now pricing in a 38% chance of a 25 basis point cut by December, up from
16% before the jobs data. The market now has a 50% chance of a March 2015 interest rate cut, up from
20%. Goldman Sachs' September interest rate cut forecast now looks possible, although most
economists are sticking to their calls for a tightening next year. The May 2 low at 0.9203 is key technical
support, a break of which could test Fibonacci retracement targets at 0.9083 and 0.8984. AUD/USD last
0.9273. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0539 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZX-50 closes up just 0.1% at 5097.51 as the market continues to wait for
companies to start reporting their FY results with Diligent (DIL.NZ) due to kick off the reporting season
Friday, says Hamilton Hindin Greene broker Grant Williamson. Diligent was up 2.4% at NZ$4.20. He says
that Heartland NZ (HNZ.NZ) closes flat at NZ$0.94 after it announced it expects net profit for FY14 to be
approximately NZ$36 million and at the upper end of a previous guidance range. Williamson adds that
Gentrack (GTK.NZ) closes 5.6% higher at NZ$2.25 after it assured investors late Wednesday it had been
unaware it would not meet earnings guidance ahead of listing. lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter:

0534 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's jobless rate has exceeded the US jobless rate for the first time since
December 2006, hitting 6.4% vs 6.2% in the U.S. The comparison adds weight to the view that Australia
merely delayed the effects of the global financial crisis, thanks to fiscal stimulus, a mining investment
boom and policies that have protected the housing market. The RBA expects unemployment to peak this
year, but if it stays high, households will have trouble servicing mortgages, house prices will falter,
consumption will fall and the economy will need more stimulus. With the government in budget-repair
mode, and the mining investment waning, the only lever to pull is monetary policy. While the RBA noted
a recent fall in borrowing rates and continued strong house price growth, it expects sub-trend economic
growth this year. With real wages growth negative and inflation near the RBA's target, bets on another
interest rate cut are increasing. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0521 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/THB climbs to 32.23 from its Wednesday close of 32.16 implying a weaker
baht despite Thailand's consumer-confidence index rising for a third straight month to 78.2 from June's
75.1. Although recent domestic data, including exports, continue to hint at economic recovery after the
military coup in May the baht has declined owing to external pressures. The crises in Ukraine and the
Middle East have whittled away at international investor confidence. Safe-haven assets rallied
Wednesday suggesting an exodus from riskier, higher-yielding assets to more liquid but low-yielding ones
such as the U.S. dollar. USD/THB is now 32.22 from its Wednesday close of 32.16.

0504 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/IDR is within the Bollinger uptrend channel -- a bullish chart indicator -- but
remains capped by the ceiling of the Ichimoku Cloud resistance zone at 11,850. The greenback could
take on a more bullish technical bias and target the round-figure trading barrier at 12,000 if it ends

Page242of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Thursday above that level. High-yielding currencies in general have been slipping due to broad risk
aversion due to geopolitical tensions. While Indonesia's Constitutional Court assesses the claims of
presidential electoral fraud made by runner-up candidate Prabowo Subianto, the market doesn't expect
much impact on the rupiah due to the low likelihood of a ruling in Subianto's favor. USD/IDR is now at
11,780 from its Wednesday close of 11,745. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0452 GMT [Dow Jones] Thailand's consumer sentiment continues to improve, with the confidence index
in July at an 11-month high, rising for the third straight month, according to a survey conducted by the
University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce. The latest index is at 78.2, up from June's 75.1. "The
improvement of consumer confidence is attributed to political stability and the recent appointment of a
new legislature that will pave the way for the selection of a new prime minister," says Thanavath
Phonvichai, director at the university. (nopparat.chaichalearmmongkol@wsj.com)

0449 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's IPO market has been weak this year in part due to the limited range
of new listings, says Nikko Asset Management senior portfolio manager Kenneth Tang. "If you look at
some of the business models they are just not as attractive as we would like," says Tang, but adds that
he likes the prospects of Indonesian dairy and poultry company Japfa Ltd.--expected to list in Singapore
on Aug. 15--because the drivers for growth are in big regional trends such as the growing appetite for
protein in Asia. Tang is most keen on Singapore stocks that can benefit from growth in external
economies or from Singapore's economic restructuring toward high value-added industries. He expects
the benchmark stock index to trade in a narrow range this year. (jake.watts@wsj.com; @jmwatts_)

0435 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/INR is down from Wednesday's five-month high of 61.52 as the chart
reveals the dollar was overbought on an intraday basis. USD/INR has been hovering around 61.35
versus its last close of 61.50. The dollar's extension past the upper Bollinger band (standard deviation 2)
on Wednesday indicated an above-average surge in volatility that is usually followed by a pullback or
consolidation. The safe haven U.S. dollar has been rising as investors shun high-risk assets on fears of
military escalation in Ukraine as well as in the middle east. Adding to negative-rupee pressures, India's
central bank said Tuesday that it might cut interest rates as soon as inflation subsides. Reducing the
interest rate would make the Indian rupee less appealing to yield-seekers. USD/INR is now 61.32 from its
Wednesday close of 61.50. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)
0421 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities slump in the morning session led by sharp declines for
casino stocks. The Hang Seng Index slips 0.5% to 24458.06, while H-shares move in step; the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index is down 0.5% to 10928.74. "The uptrend of Hong Kong stocks has
slowed down this week," says UOB-Kay Hian, citing rising fears of geopolitical risks in Russia. "Despite
[the] limited impact on Hong Kong stocks, the market took the opportunity to have a pullback." Casino
stocks plummet, leading declines as Galaxy Entertainment Group (0027.HK) falls 5.4% to HK$60.05 and
Sands China (1928.HK) loses 6.1% to HK$52.15. "This is only the beginning we think," says Reorient
Group. "Deteriorating fundamentals, bullish Street analysts and still crowded longs will equate to lower
stock prices." (gregor.hunter@wsj.com; Twitter: @gregorhunter)
0417 GMT [Dow Jones] BBY upgrades Tabcorp (TAH.AU) to buy from underperform after
stronger-than-expected FY14 results and an increase in the FY15 target payout ratio to 90% of net profit
from 80% previously. Target price rises 15% to A$4.03. TAH last up 2.9% at A$3.55.

0407 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares fall by the midday break, extending a correction into a third
consecutive session, as investors pause following recent gains and await fresh catalysts, says Tang
Yonggang, chief investment adviser at Hong Yuan Securities. The Shanghai Composite Index drops
0.6% to 2204.33, and is tipped to trade around 2200 during the session. Tang tips the index to retreat to
2150-2200 before a fresh round of gains. While the PBOC drained funds from the money market for the
second week, liquidity remains ample which could curb the downside, analysts say. Coal miners
succumb to profit-taking following a surge; Shaanxi Coal Mining (601225.SH) eases 2.3% to CNY4.71.
Financial stocks extend losses; New China Life Insurance (601336.SH) slides 2.6% to CNY23.94. The
Shenzhen Composite Index is down 0.1% at 1175.67. (amy.li@dowjones.com)
0406 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian junk bonds start to feel the pain from the selloff in their U.S. counterparts.
"Bonds with high concentration of U.S. ownership have suffered the most this week being off by 1.5-2.5
[points]" on average, says a Lucror Analytics report. "This has been driven by a more than 90 [basis
points] increase in U.S. [junk bond] yields in the last five weeks." This comes as Asian junk bonds have
been relatively resilient amid U.S. selloff. Those being hit hardest are the ones snapped up by U.S.
investors earlier, including India's Greenko Group PLC, whose 5-year bond issued last week fell by 3
points; Casino operators Melco Crown and Wynn Macau have their bonds down 1.5 and 2.5 points,
respectively, according to Lucror Analytics. (fiona.law@wsj.com)
