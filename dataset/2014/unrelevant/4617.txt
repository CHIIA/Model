0135 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian new home sales rose in June from May signaling an ongoing, albeit
modestly paced, expansion in housing construction, which is set to help support the economy. The
Housing Industry Association reported that new homes sales rose 1.2% in June from May and by 2.0% in
the second quarter from the first quarter. Sales of multi-units rose 15.9% in the month. Detached house
sales rose 2.6% in June. "The new home building sector will provide a healthy contribution to broader
economic growth in 2014-15," said Harley Dale, HIA economist. Still, the magnitude and duration of the
current new home building cycle is less certain than would usually be the case at this juncture, he
added.(james.glynn@wsj.com; twitter: @JamesGlynn WSJ)

0125 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan's unemployment rate worsened for the first time in 10 months, while its
jobs-to-applicants ratio continued to improve for 19 consecutive months, reaching a 22-year-high.
Seasonally adjusted jobless rate for June was 3.7%, down from 3.5% in May. A government official from
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications pointed to the upward trend of women entering the
labor market and men switching jobs as the main reasons. The employment rate of women between 15
and 64 was 64%, the highest since the government began compiling such data in
1968.(toko.sekiguchi@wsj.com)
0124 GMT [Dow Jones] A bet on Paladin Energy (PDN.AU) remains a highly risky proposition, despite
the uranium miner securing much-needed cash through the recent sale of a stake in a Namibian mine,
says Citigroup. Meeting debt repayments due in November 2015 and April 2017 will prove challenging for
Paladin without an improvement in uranium prices, the broker says. The sale of 25% of the Langer
Heinrich mine generated US$190 million in cash, but the broker still foresees a liquidity shortfall of about
US$90 million after repayment of the debt due in 2015, increasing to a US$350 million shortfall after
repayment of the 2017 debt. It has a "Sell/High Risk" recommendation on Paladin and a 25 Australian
cents price target. Paladin was last down 2.5% at 39.5 Australian cents. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
0110 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities are seen pulling back with few catalysts to drive stocks
upward as investors take profits from a five-day winning streak. The Hang Seng Index rose for a fifth
straight day yesterday, gaining 0.9% to 24,428.63, while H-shares entered a bull market from their March
lows. Index futures are down 0.2% ahead of the market open. "The markets will likely remain cautious
today amid lingering geopolitical risks and lack of first tier data," says Credit Agricole, adding this week's
Federal Reserve meeting will heighten investor anxiety. However, others say any selling will be limited:
"Expect any pullback in sector to be short/shallow as the recovery in the property market has happened
much faster than the Street expected and positioning problematic," says Reorient Group. "Still too many
shorts/UW positions/China bears." (gregor.hunter@wsj.com; Twitter: @gregorhunter)
0105 GMT [Dow Jones] Steel prices may have eased, but with markedly weaker prices for iron ore and
coal--the key ingredients in producing steel--it makes sense commercially for steelmakers in China to
keep production at elevated rates, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts. "Overall
gross margins are considerably stronger than six or 12 months ago, leading to stronger steel output,"
Lachlan Shaw and Vivek Dhar write in a note. They say output is running at an annualized rate of 824

Page112of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.million tons, up 5.8% compared with total 2013 production of 779 million tons. "And so far, stronger
steel output is not accumulating in inventories, with the sum total of mill and trader inventories continuing
to remain at a healthy level, in both a measure of absolute tons and also as a ratio of days of
consumption," they add, suggesting demand for the raw commodities, iron-ore and coking coal, will
remain solid. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)
0055 GMT [Dow Jones] Beach Energy (BPT.AU) notched up a solid year of production, partly thanks to
the development of the Bauer oil field in Australia's Cooper Basin, but the next leg of its growth remains
unclear, says Macquarie, which keeps a "neutral" recommendation on the stock. Beach is pinning much
of its growth potential on the development of unconventional gas resources in the Cooper Basin, but
drilling results so far have been mixed. "The reduction in unconventional spend this year and lack of
tangible progress perhaps raises doubts regarding Beach's premium valuation," Macquarie says. It keeps
a A$1.80 price target on the stock, which is down 3.8% at A$1.69. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

0050 GMT [Dow Jones] The Aussie/yen cross is trading with a buoyant tone in early Asian trade
Tuesday as Tokyo stocks post modest gains. The cross rose as high as 95.90 (stalling right at the top of
the weekly Ichimoku cloud) from its late Monday's level of 95.79 in New York. Japan's Nikkei Stock
Average was recently up 0.29% at 15,575.21. Further upside in the Aussie/yen pair may encounter
resistance at 96.17 (Thursday's high, near upper 20-day Bollinger Band) and 96.50 (July 1 top). Support
is expected at 95.47 (Monday's low, near daily kijun line). Spot AUD/JPY was recently at 95.84.

0047 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is up 0.3% at 15573.78 backed by steady improvement in corporate
earnings, says Shun Maruyama, chief Japan equity strategist at BNP Paribas Securities. For the past
few weeks, the Nikkei stayed in 15000-15500 range, but the index is now moving out of the band. "This
isn't a major 'Buy Japan' trade, but corporate earnings have been improving steadily helped by domestic
consumption and capex," Maruyama says. "We can anticipate a gradual rising trend." Nissan Motor Co.
(7201.TO) shares are up 3.4% at Y1,036.0 after the company said its April-June quarter net profit rose
37% from a year earlier.(kosaku.narioka@wsj.com)

0040 GMT [Dow Jones] A wave of planned mall developments in the U.K., U.S. and Italy will drive solid
profit growth at Westfield (WFD.AU), says Deutsche Bank, which initiates coverage of the company with
a "buy" recommendation following the sale of its Australian malls to Scentre Group (SCG.AU) last month.
Westfield has a A$11.8 billion pipeline of current and prospective developments including the retail wing
of the World Trade Center in New York, due for completion next year, and a giant new mall planned for
Milan. Deutsche Bank says these will help drive an 8.3% annual increase in funds from operations--a
key measure of profit--between FY14 and FY18. It sets its price target at A$8.05 vs the stock's latest
trade of A$7.49. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

0004 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar looks set to continue trading within ranges that have been
prominent for some time now, supported overnight by a weaker greenback, says Tom Williams, sales
trader at GoMarkets. He adds that new home sales data early Tuesday will likely provide some direction
in the Aussie dollar. However, investors will continue to trade cautiously ahead of key event risks
commencing tomorrow evening such a policy meeting at the U.S. Federal Reserve and U.S. employment
data Friday, both of which will help views on the near-term direction of the U.S. dollar. Pair is now at
US$0.9411. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

18:18 EDT - The city of Detroit today confirmed what has long been known: Its finances before filing for
the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy case were dismal. Seven months after it was due, Detroit filed
its comprehensive annual financial report for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The city at that time
was insolvent and its deficit was more than $130M, leading the city to default on several of its obligations
to its creditors that summer. (matthew.dolan@wsj.com; @matthewsdolan)

17:54 EDT - Moody's Investors Service upgrades $368M in general obligation debt from Rockland
County, New York to Baa2 from Baa3, citing the county's improved management and budget practices.
Moody's also assigns a Baa2 rating to the county's $41M in 2014 general obligation limited tax bonds
and says it maintains a positive outlook on Rockland's debt, expecting that strong budgeting practices
will continue. (aaron.kuriloff@wsj.com)
