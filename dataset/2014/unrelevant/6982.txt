Chinese group Hanlong Mining has given Wal King a hostile welcome to the chairmanship of
Sundance Resources by voting down the iron ore hopeful’s remuneration report.
Hanlong’s 14.1 per cent stake also fuelled big protest votes against the ratification of Mr King’s
appointment to the Sundance board and the re-election of fellow director Fiona Harris.

The company’s voting is believed to reflect concerns around the funding for Sundance’s drawn-out
$5 billion Mbalam- Nabeba iron ore project in Cameron and the Republic of Congo.

Sundance is seeking to finalise a funding package for the project by mid-2015, despite the worst
market for iron ore in five years.
Nearly 56 per cent of the shares voted at the company’s annual meeting yesterday were cast
against the remuneration report.

Mr King takes over from George Jones, who reassumed the helm of Sundance after the
company’s board was killed in a plane crash in the Congo in 2010.

The former Leighton Holdings chief received a “no” vote of 43 per cent and Ms Harris 44 per cent.
A resolution to re-elect Michael Blakiston was withdrawn.

Shares in Sundance lost 0.2¢ to a fresh nine-year low of 3.4¢.
