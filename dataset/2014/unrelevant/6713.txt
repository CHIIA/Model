BETTER than expected economic data from China has fuelled the sharemarket's largest one day
rally in more than three months.

Money flowed back into the market's two largest sectors, partly due to the latest measure of
manufacturing activity in China, Australian Stock Report senior equity analyst Benny Sada said.

"The miners and the banks have enjoyed a strong turnaround today and that has helped lift local
sentiment," he said.

The ASX200 index rose 0.98 per cent, its largest one-day gain since early July.
"Better manufacturing data has helped allay concerns about the Chinese economy and we've seen
the miners climb on the back of that," Mr Sada said.
Concerns had been mounting about China's economy after recent disappointing data, which had
weighed on commodity prices and local mining stocks.

After the market's heavy fall in recent weeks, bargain hunters were also helping boost the financials,
Mr Sada said.

Commonwealth Bank gained 85¢ to $77.30, ANZ rose 44¢ to $31.65, Westpac climbed 37¢ to
$32.77, and National Australia Bank added 41¢ to $33.51.
In the mining sector, Rio Tinto added 15¢ to $60.20, BHP Billiton gained 9¢ to $34.95 and Fortescue
Metals was up 8¢ at $3.66.
Gold miner Newcrest was another strong performer, adding 41¢ to $10.36.
Internet provider TPG Telecom advanced 40¢ to $7 after the company forecast earnings growth of
25 per cent over the next year.

Agricultural chemicals and seeds provider Nufarm rose 49¢ to $4.52 after it said it was confident of
lifting underlying earnings, despite a 53 per cent slide in its net profit due to restructuring costs.

At close on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 52.7 points, or 0.98 per cent, at
5415.7 points. The broader All Ordinaries index was up 47.9 points, or 0.89 per cent, at 5416.1
points.

The December share price index futures contract was up 48 points at 5408 points, with 32,892
contracts traded.
National turnover was 2.19 billion securities worth $5.6 billion. AAP
