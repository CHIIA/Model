AUCTIONS are proving a successful sales avenue across the city and hinterland property market.

Ray White Rural Tamborine Mountain selling principal Rodney Stehr said the agency had celebrated
huge results at recent auctions for acreage lifestyle properties.

“Hinterland lifestyle properties from small five to 10 acre lots to large 100-plus acreage seem to be in
high demand from both city and interstate buyers looking to acquire lifestyle or hobby farms,” Mr Stehr
said.

“Interest has risen substantially in the past 3 -6 months creating competition, especially with auction
campaigns with qualified buyers, and we are achieving prices above the pre-auction price guides given
by potential buyers. “Prices are definitely on the move northwards with the increased buyer activity.”
Sales include Beechmont property Retay, a 81.34ha former dairy farm at 1568 Beechmont Rd with
dilapidated buildings and fertile soil. The historic property had been tightly held by the Kennedy family for
90 years and was offered to the market as a deceased estate, selling for $823,000 – $173,000 over the
reserve, to a buyer from western Queensland looking to start an organic horticultural business.

“Retay had an extensive marketing campaign with the Gold Coast Bulletin and Courier- Mail and this
attracted a diverse range of interest with 30 groups inspecting,” Mr Stehr said.

He said about 30 attendees and two registered bidders attended the one-and-a-half-hour auction of 36
Bartle Rd, Tamborine Mountain, which sold for $1.325 million.
Bidding on the prestige acreage property opened at $1 million and the hammer fell $225,000 over the
independent valuation, making for some very happy vendors who had owned it for 33 years.

Sales are still buoyant across varying price points on the Isle of Capri, with Nick Cole, of Lucy Cole
Prestige Properties, selling near-new build 22 Verona Ave for an undisclosed price weeks prior to the
scheduled auction.
Ray White Broadbeach sales duo Sam Guo and Julia Kuo sold 138 Amalfi Drive at auction for $1.92
million to a Chinese buyer. The dual-storey home occupies a 900sq m block with 40m of canal
frontage.

Ray White Main Beach agent Paul Collins said properties on the Isle of Capri were selling nicely at
present, with the Capri on Via Roma shopping centre still proving a huge catalyst for sales.Mr Collins
sold 3 Milan Ct for $995,000 and 20 Remo St at auction for $780,000. The Benowa buyer was one of
four registered bidders. Selling days after auction for more than $3 million, by Lucy Cole Prestige
Properties agent Jim Sherrah, was 100 Regatta Pde, a grand residence on a 1153sq m riverfront block
in The Southport School precinct.
