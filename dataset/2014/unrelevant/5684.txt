Dairy farm income could fall by as much as $4bn in the coming season, with economists cutting their
forecasts for farm-gate milk returns after an unexpectedly sharp drop in dairy prices in the latest
Fonterra Global Dairy Trade auction. Prices fell another 8.9% and are now down by a third since
January. Whole milk powder led the decline, down 10.9% while butter prices fared better, down only
1.1%. While major-bank economists are revising forecasted farmer payouts, Fonterra is expected to wait
for a board meeting, with the next update likely to be in August, as scheduled.

At the last review Fonterra reduced its farm-gate milk price to $7kg M/S for this season, and cut the
projected $8.65 for the season ended May 31 to $8.40. Now some predictions are for as much as a
dollar being sliced off the projected price this season The volatility in dairy commodity prices is attributed
in part to China buying up strongly at the start of the year, and holding inventories which have been
slower to shrink than expected. The GDT exchange indicates prices are now the lowest since the end of
2012. Volumes traded were also down with 36,656 tonnes sold, down from 41,513 tonnes in the
previous auction.
