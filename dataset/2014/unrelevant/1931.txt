Batelco will pursue its former Indian business partner for $212 million it says he owes the company,
even though he was declared bankrupt last week, the Bahraini telecom operator said on Sunday.
Chinnakannan Sivasankaran, the chairman of Chennai-based Siva, filed for bankruptcy in the
Seychelles after a British court in June ordered Siva and Sivasankaran to pay the money to Batelco’s
wholly owned subsidiary BMIC. This related to their failed Indian joint venture.

The court also issued an indefinite worldwide freeze on the defendants’ assets.

“Mr Sivasankaran’s bankruptcy will not thwart our determination to recover the substantial monies that
he owes us,” Batelco chief executive Alan Whelan said in a company statement.

An official receiver has been appointed as the manager of Sivasankaran’s assets and BMIC is the
largest creditor, Batelco said.
Siva sold a 43 per cent stake in now-defunct mobile operator S Tel to Batelco in 2009.

S Tel struggled to compete against its better-resourced and longer-established rivals and as of the end
of 2011 had 3.55 million mobile subscribers, a 0.4 per cent market share.

In February 2012, S Tel was ordered stripped of its licences as part of a wider corruption investigation
affecting India’s mobile market that pre-dated Batelco’s investment.
Batelco subsequently agreed to sell its stake back to Siva according to the terms of their original
agreement, but then sued its former partners after it was not paid.

Big Win Puts Australia 2-0 Up against Pak women cricket team
Sydney, Australia Women moved into a 2-0 series lead over Pakistan Women courtesy of a handsome
63-run win in the second Twenty20 International.

Openers Elyse Villani (31) and Delissa Kimmince (43) helped set up Australia's score of 149 for five
before Pakistan were restricted to just 86 for eight in reply.

Sarah Coyte and Rene Farrell took matching figures of two for 14 as only two Pakistanis - Nain Abidi
(21) and Sana Mir (16) reached double figures.

Villani's run came from just 24 balls Kimmince made 43 in 48, the pair putting on 52 for the first wicket.

Further runs from Meg Lanning (22), Ellyse Perry (16) and Alyssa Healy (26) handed Australia a
competitive score.

Asmavia Iqbal and Sania Khan took two wickets apiece with Sadia Yousuf taking one.

Kimmince then struck early to remove Marina Iqbal for five and wickets continued to tumble with Aliya
Riaz (7), Bismah Maroof (0) and Nida Dar (7) all falling cheaply as well as Abidi to leave Pakistan
reeling at 53 for five.

as Erin Osborne, Julie Hunter and Megan Schutt all took a wicket apiece.

The third game in the four-match series is on Wednesday (3rd September).
