After a typical Monday morning start, the buyers went on strike especially in the banking sector which
managed to drag the index down to around 45 off at its worse before a rally on the back of Chinese GDP
figures saw us claw back some of the irrational losses and close down 11 points at 5295.

Financials were weaker in the end with the big four all down around 0.2 to 0.5% and joined by the insurers
Suncorp Group Limited (A$12.94, -0.7%),Insurance Australia Group Limited (A$5.67, -0.9%),AMP Limited
(A$4.45, -0.9%) and NIB Holdings Limited (A$2.58, -1.1%) whilst QBE bucked the trend. Macquarie
Group Limited (A$53.35, -1.1%) also joined in the sell off as did Challenger Limited (A$6.11, -1.6%) and
ASX Limited (A$36.06, -0.4%). Other defensives were also caught in the drift today as Telstra Corporation
Limited (A$5.23, -0.2%) fell away together with Wesfarmers Limited (A$43.47, -0.5%) and Woolworths
and Westfield Group (A$10.17, -0.3%).

Gold shares continued their Lazarus like recovery led by the well oversold Silver Lake Resources Limited
(A$0.69, +19.0%) which announced production numbers today and rallied hard as did others like Resolute
Mining Limited (A$0.595, +10.2%),Medusa Mining Limited (A$2.29, +6.5%),Evolution Mining Limited

Oceanagold Corporation (A$1.90, +4.4%).
Energy stocks were also weaker led by stories that Shell were looking to offload their Woodside
Petroleum Limited (A$38.80, -0.8%) holding as they rein in costs around the World. Surprise nasty
numbers from the Anglo-Dutch group on Friday adding to the rumours swirling. Healthcare stocks slipped
away with ResMed Inc. (A$5.02, -2.3%) ,Sonic Healthcare Limited (A$16.63, -1.2%),Ramsay Health Care

Hi-Fi Limited (A$19.63, -3.1%) and Myer Holdings Limited (A$2.65, -0.4%) all down a smidge, smidge and
a half.

+5.5%),Sirius Resources NL (A$2.40, +6.2%),Super Retail Group Limited (A$11.24, +4.2%),Oceanagold
Corporation (A$1.90, +4.4%),UGL Limited (A$6.93, +3.6%),Beadell Resources Limited (A$0.865,

amount.

it! Good luck in retirement Richard.

Tomorrows News Today
34 Years Ago this week, Gold Trading Reached "Delirious Proportions"$800 an ounce. The price had
doubled in the previous month on the Bunker Hunt boys buying silver and the Russian invasion of Iran
(Really that was the story!)Afghanistan was real!

Game over. Nintendo tumbles following a surprise prediction of a profit slump and disappointing sales on
Wii U. Super Mario may be too late!

Earthquake rattles New Zealand capital, Wellington!
China's economy expanded 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today. That compares 7.8 percent growth in the previous three months. Industrial
production rose 9.7 percent in December from a year earlier, data showed, down from a 10 percent gain

November. Industrial Production +7.7%.Fixed Asset Investments +19.6%. 14 year low on GDP.

It appears that the crisis in the Australian economy is taking its toll on investor sentiment with Italian and
Spanish bonds now yielding far less than Aussie bonds. Today's score on 10 year bonds is a bit of a
sad inditement: Spain 3.71 per cent, Italy 3.82 per cent, Australia 4.1 per cent. And our 15-year bonds
are yielding a heady 4.5 per cent. Worrying really. Of course we are in such terrible trouble here that the
Coalition are no-where to be seen. Can't be that bad if they can take 5 weeks off!

And this may be the reason as he's back. Italy's controversial ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi has returned to the
centre of the political stage, striking a reform deal with a centre-left rival. Bring on the Bunga Bunga!

planning to raise $500 million to $800 million in a Hong Kong IPO.
