Stocks in Australia and Tokyo fell Wednesday on worries about global economic growth, although
losses were held in check by signs of economic improvement in China.

The Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.2% to 16167.45, its fourth loss in six trading days.

"Investors will be naturally averse to place bets on risky assets after an overwhelmingly negative
overnight session in both the U.S. and Europe, but the dollar's continuing strength will help Japan
stocks weather a major fall," said Hiroichi Nishi, SMBC Nikko Securities' general manager for equities.

The dollar was changing hands at 108.64 yen in Asian trading, down from 108.88 yen late Tuesday in
New York. In New York Wednesday morning it was at 108.72 yen.
In Tokyo, Starbucks Coffee Japan rallied 4.4% on news that its parent, Starbucks, will buy the
remaining 60% of the unit it doesn't own.

Shares of Japanese component makers that supply Apple outperformed the broader market on news
that Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cellphones have sold about 10 million units since their
Sept. 19 debut. Murata Manufacturing rose 1.4%, while Alps Electric added 1.8% and Japan Display
Inc. rose 1.9%.
Firms affiliated with Japanese text-messaging companyLine Corp. fell after Line canceled plans to go
public. Game developer Ateam skidded 8.7% and entertainment-content distributor M-Up slid 8.2%.

In Sydney, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.7% to 5375.80, giving back some of Tuesday's gain. Banks
led the broad selloff on weakness in the local currency and the possibility of regulatory steps to cool
the country's property market.

The Reserve Bank of Australia raised the possibility of adopting additional measures to reinforce
sound mortgage-lending practices, particularly for loans to investors.

Commonwealth Bank dropped 1.1%, National Australia Bank was down 1.4% and Westpac Banking
and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group were both off 0.9%.

Investors were also attuned to disappointing economic news out of Germany on Wednesday, where
business confidence fell to its lowest level in more than a year in September, dimming prospects for
Europe's largest economy to rebound from an economic contraction in the second quarter. That added
to a eurozone report released Tuesday showing a slowdown in manufacturing and services activity.
Still, losses in Asia were limited by slightly better news released Tuesday in China, where a gauge of
manufacturing activity ticked higher in September. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.4% to
23921.61.
China Shenhua Energy gained 2.3% and China Resources Power Holdings jumped 2.9% on
expectations for China to play a bigger role in curbing global carbon emissions. Chinese Vice Premier
Zhang Gaoli said Tuesday that China would make a greater effort to address climate change.

on solid earnings growth in the sector because of an imminent start of the Shanghai-Hong Kong
stock-connect program in October, in which foreign investors will get more access to mainland shares.

Both Changjiang Securities and Western Securities rose by the 10% daily maximum and Everbright
Securities added 4%.

In Mumbai, India's S&P BSE Sensex slipped 0.1% to 26744.69 after the country's highest court
ordered the cancelation of most coal-mining licenses given since 1993, dragging down stocks of
metals companies as well as lenders.

Last month, the court had termed these licenses illegal, saying that they were handed out in an
arbitrary and non-transparent manner.

Jindal Steel & Power fell 10%, while Hindalco Industries recovered much of its early loss to end the
day down 0.5%. The two companies lost their licenses and may now have to buy costlier coal from
state-run miner Coal India, or import the fuel. GMR Infrastructure fell more than 10%.

Coal India climbed 5% and was the top gainer among the Sensex, as demand for its coal is expected
to increase. India allows only Coal India to mine for commercial purposes. The mining licenses given
to others are for use of coal only for their own businesses.

State-run banks also declined as a fallout of the ruling. Analysts said their bad loans may rise as the
finances of metal and power companies could weaken because of losses on investments already
made in these mines.

Bank of India lost 5.6%, Punjab National Bank fell 4.3% and State Bank of India declined 2.7%.
