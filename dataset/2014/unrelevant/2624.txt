Investment group and manufactured home estate (MHE) operators are jostling for a slab of
Victorian home estates worth as much as $60 million.
Federation Residential Village has quietly released three high-end MHE communities in Werribee,
Glenroy and Albion to market for sale in one line.

Listed developer and MHE operator Lifestyle Communities has run a ruler over the sites, as has
private equity group Alceon.

The market listing of the communities, which are regarded as some of the state's best, comes as
several groups are busy plotting an expansion into Victoria.
Sydney-based property investor PortNordica entered the southern state after purchasing an MHE
in the high-country town of Benalla last week.
The fast-expanding group paid $4.6 million for the Benalla Leisure Park, an hour's drive from
snowfields, with holiday cabins and more than 100 camping sites, which suggest opportunity for
the creation of permanent lots.
The group paid more than $10 million in May moving into south-east Queensland's MHE market,
buying the Tweed Heritage Caravan Park and the Chinderah Lakes Caravan Park. Both parks
operate under park manager Gateway Lifestyle.
