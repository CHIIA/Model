Asian investors seeking high-yielding foreign property assets are a key target for a new joint venture
between UBS Global Asset Management and Australia's largest private property developer.
The deal gives the Swiss firm first right of refusal over Grocon's Adollars 2 billion (dollars 1.8 billion)
construction pipeline, which includes investment grade commercial and residential developments.

The JV can also buy non-related third-party assets in the open market.
The joint venture, UBS Grocon Real Estate, plans to amass assets worth dollars 10 billion over the
next five years, with much of that expected to come from Asian institutions.
About 50% of current investment flows into Australian property comes from offshore, with 'a large
portion of that coming from Asia Pacific', says Trevor Cooke, Asia-Pacific head of global real estate
at UBS Global AM.
In November sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation bought into a three-tower complex
in Sydney in a deal worth more than Adollars 400 million, while Singapore-listed Suntec Reit and
Aims AMP Capital Industrial Reit are negotiating deals for Australian office towers worth a total of
Adollars 770 million.

UBS Grocon is based in Sydney and chaired by UBS Global AM chief executive John Fraser, while
Daniel Grollo, CEO of Grocon, is a non-executive director.
