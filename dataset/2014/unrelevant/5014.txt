Singapore (Platts)--21Jan2014/1241 am EST/541 GMT CHINA NATIONAL NUCLEAR TO BUY 25%
STAKE IN AFRICAN URANIUM MINE: China's largest atomic energy developer China National Nuclear
Corp. has agreed to pay $190 million to Paladin Energy for a 25% stake in the Langer Heinrich uranium
mine in Namibia, Shanghai Daily reported Tuesday quoting the Australian company. The Namibian mine,
with a 20-year lifespan, started production in 2007 and has a production capacity of 5.2 million lb/year of
uranium concentrate. Paladin said capacity could rise to 5.7 million lb/year in 2014. With a stake in the
mine it will be easier for CNNC to secure uranium supplies for its reactors, the daily said. MALAYSIA
BECOMES CHINA'S THIRD LARGEST TRADE PARTNER IN ASIA: The two-way trade volume between
China and Malaysia in 2013 reached $106 billion, Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday quoting Huang
Huikang, China's ambassador to Malaysia.

This makes Malaysia China's third largest trade partner in Asia, just next to Japan and South Korea, and
it continues to be the largest trade partner among ASEAN countries, he said. CHINA CENTRAL BANK
