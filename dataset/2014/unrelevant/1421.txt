Dairy giant invests in new plants
Fonterra plans to enter a joint venture with China’s Beingmate that will own the dairy giant’s Darnum
plant in Australia and produce infant formula products for the Chinese market — for an investment of
$615 million.

The Australian joint venture will be 51 per cent owned by Beingmate and 49 per cent by Fonterra and
will distribute Fonterra’s Anmum brand products into China, the Auckland-based company said.
The two companies will also evaluate joint investments in dairy farms in China.
Fonterra will shortly start a process to issue a partial tender offer to gain up to a 20 per cent stake in
Beingmate. It didn’t specify if this was a stake in Beingmate Baby & Food Co, a listed Chinese
company with a market value of US$2.39 billion ($2.85 billion). The infant formula partnership
would mark the first significant tie up in that market since the disastrous San Lu venture that failed
amid a tainted milk scandal in 2008.

“Our partnership with Beingmate will show the benefits of an integrated and secure supply chain,
starting in New Zealand — our number one milk pool — where we are fast-tracking investment in
milk processing capacity to meet global demand,” chief executive Theo Spierings said.
In a separate statement, Fonterra said it will invest $555 million to build a 4.4 million litres a day
drier at Lichfield in South Waikato while adding three new plants at its Edendale site that will produce
milk protein concentrate, a reverse osmosis plant that will increase capacity by 300,000 litres a day
and an anhydrous milk fat plant with a 550,000 a day capacity. BusinessDesk
