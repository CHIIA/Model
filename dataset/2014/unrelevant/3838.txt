Packaging billionaireRaphael Geminder says he is willing to consider mergers, consolidation and
major acquisitions to help Pact Group, Australia's largest plastic packaging manufacturer, achieve
its $5 billion sales target within five years.

"We will do whatever is in the best interests of shareholders whether it's a roll-up, an acquisition, a
merger – as long as it's accretive – whatever combination works we'll be open minded," Mr
Geminder told investors as Pact released its first annual results after a $1.7 billion initial public offer
last December.

Pact, which makes plastic and steel containers for the food, beverage, personal care and chemical
industries, reported a net profit of $57.7 million in 2014, beating prospectus forecasts, after booking
a one-off tax benefit, cutting costs and reaping the benefit of recent acquisitions.
Sales rose 3.6 per cent to $1.14 billion, falling slightly short of prospectus forecasts of $1.15 billion,
due mainly to the loss of a milk bottle contract with Parmalat and softer agricultural conditions in
Australia.

However, statutory earnings before interest and tax before one-off items rose 4.8 per cent to
$147 million, beating a prospectus forecast of $146.1 million, as the company cut costs,
recovered higher resin prices and completed the acquisition of three acquisitions.
Pact acquired Cinqplast, Plastop and Viscount China from Mr Geminder at the time of the IPO.
Pact booked one-off costs of $26.2 million, but also reported a $19.2 million one-off tax benefit,
which swelled bottom line profits to $57.7 million. Pact declared a final dividend of 9.5¢, payable
October 3.

Pact shares traded above their $3.80 issue price for the first time this week, but slipped 1¢ to $3.85
after the result. The shares have been weighed down by concerns over related party transactions
and corporate governance issues.
However, chief executive Brian Cridland said Pact's decision to turn down an opportunity to buy an
Indonesian packaging company 50 per cent owned by Mr Geminder showed corporate governance
protocols were working..
Mr Cridland said the board had concerns about the price of the Dynapak acquisition and future
returns.

But there was no shortage of growth opportunities, ranging from organic growth through product
innovation and new contracts to geographic expansion and "transformational" mergers and
acquisitions.

into a $5 billion enterprise during the next five years, with operations in five regions.

"We are constantly looking and are constantly aware of what's around and what might be around,"
said Mr Cridland, pointing to Pact's six-fold growth in revenues over the last 12 years.

Most of the major opportunities were in Asia, where the rigid plastic packaging market was
estimated to be worth $US58 billion – compared with $US3 billion in Australia and New Zealand –
and growing 10 per cent a year.

However, there were also opportunities to grow organically and via acquisition in Australia, Mr
Cridland said, pointing to the recent $35 million acquisition of plastic wheelie-bin maker Sulo.

"There are lots of dialogues that happen all the time," said Mr Geminder. "We know the targets and
partners we're interested in."

Pact said current trading conditions were in line with expectations. Revenues were expected to grow
this year, margins to remain stable and the Sulo acquisition would boost earnings.
