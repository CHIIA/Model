IRON ore miner Fortescue Metals has lifted net profit by 56 per cent to a record $US2.7 billion but is
balancing repaying debt with dividends.
FORTESCUE, the world's fourth largest iron ore miner, grew its full year net profit by 56 per cent to a
record $US2.7 billion but unsurprisingly did not increase its 10 US cents a share dividend.

Shareholder returns are a contentious issue for the miners with BHP Billiton shares plunging four per cent
on Wednesday when a hoped-for buyback or special dividend did not occur.

The sharemarket's top recent performers have paid higher dividends, although they have been criticised
for not investing in growth.

Fortescue shares fell 1.5 per cent to $4.585 and are down more than 12 per cent in the last 12 months.
Fortescue's founder and biggest shareholder Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest will still collect about $103 million
through his 33 per cent stake.
When iron ore prices fell sharply in 2012 and tested Fortescue's profitability, it was forced to secure a
$US4.5 billion funding line to avoid breaching its debt covenants.
Its net debt reached a peak last year of $US10.5 billion but has been rapidly cut to $US7.2 billion, with
the company also announcing on Wednesday it would repay another $US500 million early in October.
The company intends increasing its dividend pay-out ratio from a current 21 per cent to 30-40 per cent
as long as it repays a planned $2-$2.5 billion in two years, reducing gearing to 40 per cent.
That assumes iron ore prices do not change greatly after falling 30 per cent this year to a current $US93
a tonne.

That cannot be guaranteed although Mr Power said Fortescue expects prices to rise as high cost
production is forced out and Chinese demand stays high.

"We've been very clear about what our strategy is and we have communicated clearly that our focus is
debt reduction," he told reporters.

"It is a matter of maintaining balance, recognising that shareholders need to be rewarded along the way
... we felt 10 cents was about right.

"We are very relaxed and comfortable with our position at the moment and the speed at which we are
repaying debt."
The company has seemingly thrived since its crisis, finishing its $US9.2 billion three-year expansion,
and it expects to hit its target of 155 to 160 million tonnes of iron ore in fiscal 2015.
The company has cut costs by about $US2 billion since 2012 including 23 per cent in production costs
in the last year.
All-in costs are about $US60 a tonne, meaning it can handle further falls in the iron ore price.

bullish outlook for iron ore prices was not shared by peers such as BHP Billiton chief Andrew Mackenzie.

"They have still got a considerable amount of debt on the balance sheet ... that is certainly still the risk
that comes with Fortescue and that 98 per cent of earnings comes from China and they are exposed to
one and one only commodity."
