0722 GMT [Dow Jones] A September deadline is looming for Australian rare-earths miner Lynas
(LYC.AU) to repay $35 million of a larger loan to Japanese trading house Sojitz Corp. (2768.TO) and
state-owned lender Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. And that is worrying investors, who are
questioning why Sojitz and Jogmec haven't extended the deadline. A time cushion would give Lynas a
chance to ramp up output at its Mount Weld mine in Western Australia and its Malaysian processing
plant. "The position of the Japanese is intriguing," said Mike Harrowell, a resources analyst at BBY Ltd.

"I'd be staggered if the Japanese don't support the company, but their support to date has created
short-term balance-sheet difficulties for Lynas that appear inconsistent with Japan's need to insure
against Chinese rare-earth availability." In May, Lynas said it was working with Japanese bank Nomura
on refinancing its senior debt with Sojitz and Jogmec while it tapped equity markets for a further 40
million Australian dollars. (daniel.stacey@wsj.com; @DanielStacey)
