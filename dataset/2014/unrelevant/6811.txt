The local sharemarket was dragged down by mining stocks as new data showed exports of iron
ore and coal to China declined.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dipped 7.9 points, or 0.2 per cent, on Tuesday to 5317, after a
weak lead from offshore after major equity markets in the United States closed lower.

Investors were cautious ahead of the release of US trade balance data due for release before the
Australian market opens on Wednesday. The confirmation of Janet Yellen as the next chairman of
the US Federal Reserve – which is considered a positive for markets – was widely expected.
Domestically, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed the local trade deficit fell to $118 million,
seasonally adjusted, in November from a revised $358 million gap in October.
The result beat consensus economist forecasts for a deficit of $300 million. Exports were flat in
November, while imports were down 1 per cent.

"The improvement in the trade deficit for November should be viewed as part of an improving trend.
The mining boom is entering a new phase, where capacity for production and exports is increasing
significantly," St George Bank senior economist Hans Kunnen said.
However, the detail of the export data showed the volume of metal ore and coal exports both fell in
November.
On the sharemarket, metals and mining was the worst-performing sector, down 1 per cent.

Resources giant BHP Billiton fell 0.9 per cent to $37.21, main rival Rio Tinto dropped 2.6 per cent to
$66 while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group shed 4.7 per cent to $5.44.
Junior iron ore miner Atlas Iron was the worst-performing stock, down 8.2 per cent at $1.01 as the
spot price for iron ore, landed in China, dipped to $US134.80 a tonne. Mount Gibson Iron fell
6.5 per cent at 94¢.

Fund manager MLC Investments has sold off Australian equities, arguing the local market has an
unacceptable exposure to the risk of economic shocks from China.
"Even if China does manage to pull off a rebalancing of its economy from an export to a
consumption base with minimal volatility, the good news would still not be great news for Australia
because it would mean less demand for our iron ore and coal exports," MLC head of investments
Susan Gosling said.

The big four banks were mixed. Commonwealth Bank added 0.2 per cent to $77.72, ANZ Banking
Group fell 0.4 per cent to $31.86, while Westpac and National Australia Bank each dipped 0.1 per
cent to $32.08, and $34.50, respectively.a rotation away from some defensive stocks

defensive stocks, such as the big four banks, that have done extremely well through the recovery
since the GFC".
The investment bank's equity research house is recommending clients go overweight on big
resource producers likely to get a boost from an uptick in the economic growth cycle, such as BHP
Billiton, Rio Tinto and Santos, while underweight on defensive names such as the big four banks,
Telstra, Woolworths and Wesfarmers.

"Consensus earnings growth expectations for the resources sector is about 18 per cent compared to
5 per cent for the banks, so resources is definitely where you want to be overweight at the moment,"
Mr Lee said.

"But you don't want to be too underweight the big four banks: while 5 per cent earnings growth is not
very exciting there is not much downside risk and they offer attractive yield."
Australia's biggest oil producer, Woodside Petroleum, dipped 0.1 per cent to $37.66. The Leviathan
gas venture in Israel, which Woodside Petroleum is negotiating to join, has secured its first sales
contract in a $US1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) deal to sell gas to the Palestine Power Generation
Company.
Local energy producers were mostly lower on reports that Royal Dutch Shell and BP are considering
selling their local refineries and petrol stations, a move that would shake up the $50 billion local
petrol industry. Caltex Australia lost 0.6 per cent to $19.36.
However, junior oil and gas companyBuru Energy was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200,
climbing 8.8 per cent to $1.98, as Brent crude oil rose to $US107.25 a barrel.
Forge Group dumped 8.1 per cent to $1.31. The embattled resources services company rallied over
the previous fortnight as the world's major money manager, BlackRock, built a shareholder stake,
but on Monday, BlackRock ceased being a substantial shareholder.

The biggest grocery sellers were mixed as US discount grocery giant Costco announced it will
continue its aggressive expansion into the local market. Woolworths dipped 0.1 per cent to $33.76,
while Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, edged up 0.1 per cent to $43.67, and wholesaler Metcash was
unchanged at $3.10.
