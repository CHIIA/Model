SYDNEY--China's Baosteel Group Corp. and Australian freight operator Aurizon Holdings Ltd.
(AZJ.AU) are readying a bid for iron ore and coal miner Aquila Resources Ltd. (AQA.AU) that values
the company at around 1.4 billion Australian dollars (US$1.3 billion).

Baosteel and Aurizon said they intend to make a joint offer worth A$3.40 a share for the shares in
Aquila that they don't currently own. Baosteel, one of China's largest steelmakers, already has a 20%
stake in Perth-based Aquila.

The move signals a renewed appetite by major state-owned Chinese investors in Australian mining,
despite concerns about an oversupply of iron ore as companies such as Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) invest
billions of dollars to expand their Australian mines. China's economy has also stuttered of late,
contributing to iron-ore prices falling toward their lowest level since late 2012.
For its part, Aurizon has made little secret of its desire to expand in iron ore and gain a foothold in
Western Australia where companies are under no obligation to open their rail lines to rivals. Aurizon is
Australia's largest hauler of coal, but its existing operations are mostly in eastern Australia's
Queensland state.
Aquila is among a new wave of smaller iron-ore miners trying to break the stranglehold of Rio Tinto,
BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AU) in the Pilbara region of Western
Australia state. That region accounts for more than 40% of the iron ore traded by sea, much of it
shipped to China.
However, the company has struggled to secure financing to build new mines, including the proposed
A$7.4 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project in Western Australia, after commodity prices began to
weaken in late 2011. Lenders became wary about providing debt to companies such as Aquila, which
wanted to build projects at a cost that dwarfed their own market value.
The West Pilbara Iron Ore Project, which aims to produce at least 30 million metric tons of iron ore
annually, requires the construction of a 282-kilometer rail line to connect the mine with a new port at
Anketell Point.

"We believe, with Baosteel, that this is a very attractive project," Aurizon Chief Executive Lance
Hockridge told reporters. "The infrastructure would provide attractive returns for the owners of Aurizon.
For Baosteel, of course, [it] secures further access to a very high quality, low cost iron-ore project and
coal."
Aquila has been selling assets to build up enough funds to start building the West Pilbara Iron Ore
Project, which it owns jointly with Greenwich, Ct.-based resources private equity house AMCI.
In April 2012, the company raised A$430 million from the sale of its 50% interest in the Isaac Plains
coal mine in Queensland to Japan's Sumitomo. Last year, Aquila boosted its cash position by a further
A$170 million by offloading its 24.5% interest in another coal project--Belvedere--to Brazil's Vale SA
(VALE) after resolving a long-running dispute over how much the asset is worth.

Australian companies, similar to their offshore peers, have been managing their balance sheets
conservatively since the global financial crisis by upping cash reserves and trimming debt levels.
