THE sharemarket's seven day winning streak has ended due to significant falls in the bank and
mining sectors.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index hit a six year high of 5554.5 points in early trade before falling
back.

CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner said investors thought it was time to sell after the market's
recent strong run, with stocks appearing fully valued.

"It's one of those sessions where selling builds on itself," Mr Spooner said.
The mining sector was under pressure from a decline in iron ore prices and news that 30 out of 31
provinces in China had missed their economic growth targets, Mr Spooner said.

BHP Billiton dropped 26¢ to $37.61, Rio Tinto shed 76¢ to $61.30 and Fortescue Metals was 12¢
lower at $5.00.

Among the major banks, Commonwealth Bank hit a record high of $79.95 in early trade but closed
51¢ weaker at $78.94.

ANZ retreated 34¢ to $34.60, Westpac lost 47¢ to $35.39 and National Australia Bank dropped 48¢ to
$35.51.
Elsewhere, Oil Search picked up 9¢ to $8.89 and Santos gained 3¢ to $13.55.

Wesfarmers lost 88¢ to $43.01 after its third quarter sales figures fell short of market expectations.
Roc Oil shares slipped 0.5¢ to 45¢ and Horizon Oil dipped 1.5¢ to 35.5¢ as the two oil and gas
players struck an $800 million deal to merge their Asia-focused assets.

Mr Spooner said trade in the rest of the week would be influenced by overseas economic
developments, including a conclusion of the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday,
April manufacturing data for China on Thursday and monthly US jobs figures on Friday.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was 49.5 points, or 0.89 per cent, lower at 5486.6 points.

The broader All Ordinaries index was down 49.2 points, or 0.89 per cent, at 5466.9 points.

The June share price index futures contract was down 59 points at 5474 points, with 35,473 contracts
traded.
National turnover was 1.45 billion securities worth $4.78 billion. AAP
