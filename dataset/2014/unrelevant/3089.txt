Debt-ridden Lanco Infratech is selling its Australian unit Griffin Coal Mining Company to reduce debt as
stated by Livemint. The company had purchased the Australian unit for $665 Mn in 2011. Along with the
sale of Griffin Coal Mining Co, Lanco Infratech is also in talks to divest a hydroelectric power plant in
India.

Lanco Infratech is also signing a corporate debt restructuring agreement for R7500 Cr to restructure debt
that reached to R33900 Cr in September and will also give it access to new credit of R3500 Cr. Its lenders
includeState Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd. Lanco acquired the mine, which is estimated to have
reserves of 1.2 billion tonnes, to secure fuel for its upcoming projects. Griffin Coal Mining, located in
Western Australia, produces 4 million tonnes of coal every year. Lanco had plans to invest over
Australian $1 billion more to scale up the output to 18 million tonnes by 2018.

Gurgaon headquartered Lanco Infratech Limited has been driving growth in the domains of Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (EPC), Power, Solar, Natural Resources and Infrastructure. The company
runs a 70-megawatt hydropower plant in Himachal Pradesh. The infrastructure company posted a loss of
R31.6 Cr in Q4, against a profit of R72.7 Cr for the corresponding previous period. For the financial year
ended March 31, 2013, the company posted a loss of R1,073.3 Cr (R112 Cr loss previous year). Income
for the financial year was down 1 per cent at R15, 259 Cr.
Referring to divestment in wind and solar units, Lanco recently sold its 10 MW wind farm in Tirunelveli,
Tamil Nadu to a spinning mill. In January 2012, the company was seeking to raise as much as $750
Mnby selling a stake in its power business to PE investors.

Last year, Kolkata-based CESC was acquiring Lanco Infratech'sBudhil Hydro Power, a 70 MW hydro
power project in Himachal Pradesh for about R750 Cr. In 2012, debt-laden Lanco Infratech was set to
raise $2 Bn from Chinese banks and financial institutions.
In this space, Jindal Steel was planning to buy a coal based power plant at Nellore, Andhra Pradesh from
Kineta Power; HCC was planning to raise up to R1,000 Cr by selling stake in real estate and non- core
infrastructure assets for paring some of its debt and reducing the strain on its balance sheet. Other
companies such as DLF, GMR Infrastructure and GVK Power and Infrastructure, among others, are also
looking at divesting stake in projects and subsidiaries, besides selling assets, to raise funds to pay off
debt.
