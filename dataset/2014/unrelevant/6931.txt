MARKET BACK TO LEVELS OF

The banks, as proxy for the dollar led the way down while the $A is at 90.10US c, down about 35 points

France and Japan a year ago.

Analysts expect more defaults, following Premier Li's statement yesterday that some financial product
defaults may be unavoidable. Bloomberg reports regional authorities set up thousands of financing
vehicles to raise funds to build subways, highways and sewage works. Their liabilities rose to 17.9 trillion
Yuan as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion Yuan at the end of 2010, according to the National Audit Office
data.
*Separately Bloomberg reported China's four biggest lenders, all state controlled banks, saw $70 billion
vanish from stocks in trading yesterday.

*Then there is the Ukraine referendum on Sunday.

*Fortescue led the iron ore miners down, shedding 14c to $4.98 on 18.6 million shares.
