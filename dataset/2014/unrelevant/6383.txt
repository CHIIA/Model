Herbert Smith Freehills has advised Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) on its new solar farm at Moree
in northern New South Wales, which is the first merchant financed project ever undertaken in Australia.
Herbert Smith Freehills advised FRV on all aspects of the transaction including engineering, procurement
and construction, project financing and land access arrangements.

The 70 megawatt (MWp) solar farm will have a capital value of approximately A$164 million. It will be
partially funded through a A$101 million funding grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency
(ARENA) and a A$47 million loan from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

The project represents several significant developments for the Australian renewables industry. It is the
biggest Australian solar project using single axis tracking, and the first large scale renewable project to
receive both ARENA and CEFC support.

The Herbert Smith Freehills team was led by partners Brendan Quinn and Toby Anderson, who were
supported by senior associates Chris Skordas, Kris Percy, Cameron Watson, and solicitors Rupert Baker
and Micaela McLean.

Matt Baumgurtel, General Counsel at Fotowatio Renewable Ventures in Australia, said: "The team at
Herbert Smith Freehills have done a great job on a challenging project, the experience across their
business in the renewables space has been invaluable to our Moree Solar Farm project."

Brendan Quinn commented: "We are extremely pleased to have been able to assist Fotowatio Renewable
Ventures bring to financial close this important project as its biggest investment in Australia to date."

This deal is yet another example of the strong work of Herbert Smith Freehills' Energy and Project
Finance Team, who previously acted for:

the sponsors or financiers of over 75% of the wind farms to achieve financial close in Australia to date

the sponsor or financiers on all but one wind farm to achieve financial close in Australia in the last four
years
the developer of the first commercial scale solar project in Australia (Cth Solar Flagship Funding
Program)
