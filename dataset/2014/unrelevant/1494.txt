Sydney, Australia, April 9, 2014 - (ABN Newswire) - The China CleanTech Index provides the definitive
measure of the performance of Chinese cleantech companies that are listed on stock exchanges around
the world.

The cleantech industry is split into a number of sub-sectors as detailed in the table below. Each of the
sub-sectors contains companies that have both environmental and economic benefits.

TD

Biogas

Geothermal - Hot dry rocks and conventional

Biofuels

Low Emissions Transport Technologies

Carbon Trading
Solar Thermal and Photovoltaics
Energy Efficiency & Biomaterials

Waste Management & Recycling
Energy Storage & Fuel Cells

Water

Environmental Services

Wave, Tidal & Hydro

Green Buildings
Wind Generation

The cleantech sector is fundamentally different to Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) or
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance. SRI and ESG look at incremental
improvements in company performance and can be seen as 'operational hygiene' measures that find the
best in class. Cleantech focuses on companies whose output positively enhances the communities and
ecologies in which they reside. It is about doing 'more good' rather than 'less bad'.

With over 160 companies falling under the coverage of the Index and with a combined market capitalisation
of over 1 trillion Renminbi (US$165 billion), the China CleanTech Index presents for the first time a picture
of the Chinese cleantech industry's growth in a single measure.

The Index is weighted by market capitalisation and is benchmarked against the following indices to show its
relative performance:

Page77of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.- Wilder Hill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX) - which measures the performance of global clean
energy stocks

- Cleantech Index (CTIUS) - which measures the performance of global cleantech stocks
- China Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) - which measures the performance of stocks listed in
Shanghai.

- MSCI World (MSCI) - which provides a measure of the performance of global stock markets.

The rules for the formulation and management of the Index have been developed with reference to global
best practice. An overview of these rules is provided in the annual performance report.
The China Cleantech Index is updated each month and published on the SinoCleantech website at
www.sinocleantech.com and on the Australian CleanTech website at www.auscleantech.com.au. It is
published internationally in conjunction with Cleantech Investor (www.cleantechinvestor.com) and in China
in conjunction with Top Capital (www.topcapital.cn).
