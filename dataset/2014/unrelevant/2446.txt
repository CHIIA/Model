CHINA’S Baosteel is in the box seat to secure a big iron ore holding in Western Australia after Mineral
Resources was rebuffed in its bid for control of explorer Aquila Resources.
Aquila yesterday rejected mining contractor Mineral Resources’ $1.5 billion takeover offer,
recommending its shareholders accept an earlier $1.4 billion offer from Baosteel and joint partner
Aurizon.

The prize will be the opportunity to restart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project, which
Chinese state-owned Baosteel and locally listed rail operator Aurizon are confident of building.
Analysts said Aquila’s latest move paves the way for Baosteel to shore up new iron ore supply and
build a buffer to help China mitigate the risk of future higher prices for the key steelmaking
ingredient.Mineral Resources bought a near 13 per cent stake in Aquila last week before launching a
share-swap takeover offer on Monday. Aquila shares closed up 7 per cent, at $3.35 while Mineral
Resources lost 2.1 per cent at $9.35.
