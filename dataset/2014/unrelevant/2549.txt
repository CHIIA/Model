Mantra Group, a hotels operator backed by private equity firmCVC Capital Partners and investment
bank UBS, is set to embark on a roadshow in Asia and Australia next week before a $500 million
initial public offering.

The potential IPO heralds the first listing of a major hotel owner on the Australian Securities
Exchange.

As foreshadowed by this column, Mantra Group chief executive Bob East will meet with prospective
investors in Hong Kong on Tuesday and in Sydney and Melbourne later this week.

According to the marketing material prepared for the roadshow – seen by Street Talk – East will tell
investors that Mantra is the second-largest accommodation operator in Australia, with its three brands
Mantra, Peppers and BreakFree selling more than 2.5 million room nights each year.

The group's exposure to both the corporate and leisure tourism markets and its capital-light business
model are the key aspects of the pitch.

Mantra typically has long-term management right agreements over each of its units and it is the
owner's obligation to fund refurbishments, not Mantra's.

The group will be quick to point out that serviced apartment revenue has been growing faster than
hotels and motels. As with most early-IPO roadshows, investors are likely to be given the run-down
on industry dynamics – Australian room revenue has grown an average 5.5 per cent each year for the
past 10 financial years – with Mantra's more meaty financial information held back for a later round.
The group racked up annual revenue of close to $450 million in its latest accounts while earnings
neared $75 million.
Lead managers Macquarie Capital and UBS will have to forge a new market for this IPO. Mantra has
no obvious listed peers in Australia or globally, and fund managers are aware of previous attempts to
sell the business, which has a chequered history under CVC Capital Partners' ownership.
CVC is keen to sell its entire stake in the group. It is pulling out of Australia after a torrid decade and
hopes to list Mantra within the next two months.
