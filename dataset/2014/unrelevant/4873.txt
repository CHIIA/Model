Treasury Wine Gets Rival Takeover Bid From TPG--2nd Update

SYDNEY--A takeover fight has broken out between two of the world's biggest buyout firms for an
Australian winemaker that produces California's mass-market Beringer brand as well as the premium
local Penfolds label.
U.S. private-equity firm TPG is behind a 3.38 billion Australian dollar (US$3.14 billion) rival bid for
Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. that matches one made days earlier by KKR & Co. and Rhone Group LLC,
said a person familiar with the matter.

The vintner said Monday that it had received a nonbinding takeover proposal from a private-equity
firm it didn't identify. Treasury wine has given the new bidder access to its books, according to the
company, which said the private-equity firm's offer wouldn't necessarily translate into a formal
proposal.

Last week, KKR and Rhone also offered A$5.20 a share--10.6% above a A$4.70-a-share proposal by
KKR acting alone in April. KKR and Rhone have also been given permission to carry out due diligence.
Treasury Wine shares rose as much as 3.7% in Sydney to A$5.32 on Monday, a sign some investors
expect the competing suitors to fight it out. Private-equity firms including KKR, Blackstone Group L.P.
and TPG Inc. are flush with cash after taking advantage of buoyant share markets to sell earlier
investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
Treasury Wine is the world's second-biggest listed winemaker behind Constellation Brands Inc. of the
U.S. It became more vulnerable to a takeover in July 2013, when poor sales of cheaper brands such as
Beringer forced the company to destroy thousands of gallons of wine that had passed the drink-by
date and book a A$155 million write-down.
Problems have plagued Melbourne-based Treasury Wine since its 2011 spinoff from Australian brewer
Foster's Group, which was later bought by SABMiller. Back then, a glut of Australian grapes and weak
sales in the U.S. weighed on profit, contributing to a A$1 billion write-down of the business before the
spinoff.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers have been developing a taste for more expensive wines than many of
those currently produced for that market by Treasury Wine. The Australian dollar's stubborn strength
has also made the winemaker's products less attractive than competing vintages from rival regions
such as South America.
Treasury Wine is also facing intense competition in Australia, including from a wave of New Zealand
imports, while a Chinese crackdown on extravagant gift-giving as part of an anticorruption drive has
stalled sales in the world's second-biggest economy.
