Wesfarmers, the Australian retailing-to-coal-mining conglomerate, is eyeing acquisition targets
following an agreement to sell its insurance broking division to US companyArthur J Gallagher & Co for
A$1.15bn (US$1.1bn).
The disposal of its broking businesses in Australia, UK and New Zealand follows the A$1.8bn sale of
the group's insurance underwriting business to IAG in December.

Regulatory approval for both sales, still pending, would create a nearly A$3bn cash pile for Wesfarmers,
estimates UBS. With that, Wesfarmers is considering whether to go on a buying spree.

"We have our eyes on a number of sectors," Richard Goyder, Wesfarmers' managing director, told the
Financial Times in an interview last week, before Monday's announcement of the proposed disposal of
its insurance broking division.

"We do the work then we wait for an opportunity to buy at a price we think is attractive for our
shareholders."
The sale by Wesfarmers is the latest in a string of mergers and acquisition activity in Australia. Deal
volumes reached US$19.4bn in the first quarter, compared with $9.6bn in the same period a year
earlier, according to Dealogic. That is the highest level of M&A activity since the first quarter of
2011, reflecting an improved economic outlook for the country. 

Wesfarmers began life as a farmers' co-operative in Western Australia in 1914 and has grown into a
conglomerate comprising retailing, mining and chemicals divisions among others. It is Australia's
biggest private sector employer with about 200,000 staff, and its retail businesses include the Coles
supermarket chain as well as Target and Kmart.

In a note to clients on Monday, UBS said Wesfarmers had three options for the almost A$3bn in cash
generated from its recent disposals: a one-off return of capital to shareholders; acquisitions; or paying
down debt.

"Following the divestment, [Wesfarmers] will have in excess of A$5bn of unused facilities. We estimate
that a A$7bn acquisition funded via a 50/50 mix of debt and equity would be about 2 per cent accretive
in fiscal year 2015," said UBS.

Mr Goyder said Wesfarmers would not simply sit on a "whole pile of cash" but would either use it to take
advantage of opportunities or give it back to shareholders.

"One of the things we have been good at over time is to take advantage of discontinuities," said Mr
Goyder.

Wesfarmers bought Coles for A$19bn in 2007 in an opportunistic deal following an ownership review by
the retailer, and the supermarket chain has flourished under Wesfarmers' management. Last month
Coles said it would open 70 new stores, creating 16,000 jobs over three years.

which was valued at up to US$4bn, before the process was subsequently halted by Li Ka-shing, its
billionaire owner.
Wesfarmers' success at turning round distressed assets could make the coal industry a potential target
given the sharp fall in prices across the sector.
"I'd rather be buying coal assets [now] than a few years ago," said Mr Goyder. "We'd have a strict rule
on any resources business. If you are not a low cost quartile producer you do not want to be in it . . . if
you are a high cost producer at current pricing it would be difficult to make any money."
