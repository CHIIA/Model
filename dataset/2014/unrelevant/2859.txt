Takeovers - $6b vision for Anketell Point
China's most powerful steel maker, Baosteel, is making an aggressive play to unlock a new iron ore
province in the West Pilbara, and is planning to help underwrite a $6 billion port and rail development
at Anketell Point to service the region.

State-owned Baosteel on Monday joined forces with rail haulage company Aurizon to lob a $1.34
billion takeover bid for Perth-based Aquila Resources.
The cash bid of $3.40 a share would grant them control of the stalled $7.4 billion West Pilbara Iron
Ore project, which is led by Aquila in a joint venture.

The bidders will have great difficulty getting the bid over the line without the support of the board,
given executive chairman Tony Poli - a former rich lister - and co-founder Charles Bass hold about 40
per cent of the registry.
The offer, which values Aquila at $1.42 billion, is conditional on 50 per cent acceptances.
Baosteel already owns 19.8 per cent of Aquila, after taking a strategic stake in 2009. But on Monday
Baosteel Resources vice-president Wu Yiming expressed frustration at delays to the West Pilbara
project.

She said Baosteel had tried its best and had installed executives on the Aquila board to try to
fast-track the project.

"We've been very patient but we have become frustrated," she said. "So what we are going to do is
get things started."

Aurizon chief Lance Hockridge agreed, saying he was confident the bidding duo could "burst through
the impasse".

"There is clear frustration to see what on the surface is a very high-quality, highly prospective project
has not progressed," he said.
It includes the proposed $6 billion deepwater port to be built at Anketell Point near Dampier, and a
432-kilometre heavy-haul rail line, which would unleash a new iron ore province in the Pilbara.
Anketell would have an initial shipping capacity of about 40 million tonnes but that could be
expanded to 300 million tonnes.
The West Pilbara project's iron ore resource of about 2.2 billion tonnes could alone underpin the
infrastructure development.

hundreds of tonnes of land-locked opportunity [in iron ore]," Mr Hockridge said.
Baosteel has been pushing for the diversification of supply of Pilbara iron ore through the
development of Anketell.

Martin Alciaturi, Aquila's general manager of finance and corporate, said the bid had lobbed in the
early hours of Saturday but Aquila needed more time to consider the bid in full.
Aquila, which listed on the exchange in 2000, also has a 50 per cent stake in the Eagle Downs hard
coking coal project in Queensland's Bowen Basin.
Some analysts question the timing of the Baosteel-Aurizon bid, given coal prices are in the doldrums.

The bid sent shares up 36.32 per cent to close at $3.36 on Monday.
