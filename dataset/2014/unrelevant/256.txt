'Vodafail' may just lead to a Voda sale

Vodafone Group chief executive Vittorio Colao has told investors the company ï¿½would considerï¿½
selling its Australian operations along with other non-core assets and has been checking with potential
buyers. Vodafone Hutchison Australia is a 50-50 joint-venture between UK- based Vodafone Group and
Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa Limited.But analysts and banking sources have warned the company
would struggle to find a buyer for the business until there are clearer signs Vodafone Australia has
recovered. Mr Colao was speaking at a Morgan Stanley technology, media and telecoms conference in
Barcelona this week when asked if he'd consider the sale of operations in Australia, Hungary and the
Czech Republic. ï¿½We constantly check with possible parties interested in some of our less core
assets,ï¿½ MrColao reportedly said. ï¿½We would consider sales but we are not distressed sellers so
therefore we must sell at full value. Otherwise we keep them and manage the cash.ï¿½ After the
comments emerged, Vodafone Australia said in a statement Mr Colao was referring to the general
principle that Vodafone was open to potential changes to its portfolio and it had no specific plans to sell.
Any sale would come at a critical time for the Vodafone Australia as it attempts to repair its reputation
after a network meltdown dubbed 'Vodafail'. It has lost more than 2 million users over the past two years
and is continuing to lose customers but the rate of decline has greatly slowed in the last few months. The
joint-venture nature of Vodafone Australia also means all major

decisions must be accepted and funded by both parties, which in turn makes it less attractive to potential
buyers. Telstra's dominance of the local mobile market and SingTel-Optus' position in second place
means it is hard for a third-placed player to turn a strong profit. ï¿½Ultimately in any deal you have to find
a buyer and I think that's the real hurdle here,ï¿½ said one senior analyst, who declined to be named.
ï¿½You're most likely player would be an overseas mobile provider but there aren't many out there that
are buying. ï¿½Locally there's sense putting mobile and fixed-line services together so TPG Telecom
would be the one that springs to mind.ï¿½ Where Vodafone Australia currently pays fixed-line providers to
send its mobile data for phone and internet services across the country, a merger with a fixed-line player
would help it slash costs and let it sell fixed-line broadband services for the first time. Sources said it has
previously considered buying both iiNet and TPG Telecom. TPG would benefit by getting more use out of
its networks and gain the ability to bundle a wide- range of telecommunications services. It would then be
able to take on Telstra and SingTel-Optus and be in a better position to target the corporate market. TPG
is also one of the few Australian telecommunications companies that is big enough to attempt a merger or
acquisition of Vodafone Australia. Telstra and Optus are unlikely to get permission from competition
regulators to make such a move. Earlier this month Swiss banking giant UBS said Vodafone Group
should sell Vodafone Australia to focus on European and Asian growth businesses in a move that could
earn it $2.68 billion.
