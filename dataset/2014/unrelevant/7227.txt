Uni students are cheating on an industrial scale, paying up to $1000 for others to do their work. Amy
McNeilage and Lisa Visentin report.
Up to 1000 students have hired a Sydney company to write their essays and assignments and sit
online tests. The practice threatens the credibility of some of the nation's most prestigious institutions.

A Fairfax Media investigation has uncovered a sophisticated online business, which has produced
thousands of university assignments and turned over hundreds of thousands of dollars since it began
operating in May 2012.
Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, is the sole director of MyMaster Group, which is behind the website,
written in Chinese and aimed at international students. It claims to be the largest essay-writing
service in Sydney, with 100 graduate writers from "prestigious universities in Australia" ready to
accept jobs.

A flyer posted to a toilet door at UTS gives insight to the anxiety among international students Ms Dou
has capitalised on.

"Are you racking your brains on your schoolwork? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition
on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!," it says in
translation.

Fairfax Media has seen 700 receipts for direct deposits to the MyMaster bank account, totalling more
than $160,000 this year alone - a conservative estimate of the company's income, as students can
also pay by cash or PayPal.

Payments range from $13 to $1050 and during busy assessment periods the website receives up to
20 requests a day.

One request lodged was for a 6000-word research assignment for a human rights law course at the
University of NSW, which was worth 70 per cent of the student's overall grade.

The cheating is widespread throughout universities, with almost 1000 assignments produced this year
for students studying courses as diverse as philosophy, economics, law, engineering, astronomy and
marketing.

One student spent more than $1500 on assignments for five courses at the University of Newcastle's
Business School. Another student from the University of Wollongong paid for at least eight
assignments.

The University of Sydney, the state's premier institution, was among the most widely affected. During
2014, students from at least 37 of the university's courses used the service.

Ms Dou went to high school at Pittwater House, a private school in Collaroy, and studied accounting
at Macquarie University.
When approached by Fairfax Media, Ms Dou, who runs a university tutoring company called
Yingcredible, would not comment on the website.

"If you're talking about MyMaster, I have nothing to talk [about]," she said. "No comment for today."

Records show MyMaster and Yingcredible Tutoring are registered to the same principal place of
business in Sussex Street in Chinatown. Ms Dou is also the registrant of the mymaster.com.au
website domain. Within hours of Fairfax Media approaching Ms Dou, the site was taken down.

online was widespread. On two separate occasions while he was working on a group assignment,
international students in the group suggested they purchase the assignment online, rather than do
the work themselves. "I was not keen on that idea. I think people just want to do whatever they can to
pass the course at all costs," he said.

Prices are advertised as a flat rate based on the number of words and the student's qualification, with
masters students paying more than undergraduates or diploma students. The flat rates promise
students a pass or credit grade, but they can negotiate for work that is of a distinction or high
distinction quality.
MyMaster recruits its writers on Chinese social media sites, promising good rates.

Clients have also paid for business reports, speeches, PowerPoint presentations and the completion
of online tests, and requests range from short homework tasks to comprehensive research
assignments.

Some students uploaded instructions for their ghost writer, detailing how they wanted their assignment
to be completed.

They are guaranteed the purchased work is original and will not be detected by the universities'
plagiarism software.

Fairfax Media is aware of numerous websites offering similar services to students in Australia but
most appear to be based offshore.
Australia's international student market is a $15 billion industry and the largest export after iron ore,
coal and gold. International students, who often pay more than three times as much as locals for their
degrees, generate a quarter of the income at some universities.

Interstate universities have also been ensnared, including RMIT, La Trobe, Curtin and the
Queensland University of Technology.

The chief executive of Universities Australia, Belinda Robinson, said universities were aware of such
operations looking to exploit "a small minority of students seeking an easy path to success".

"Students caught deliberately attempting to pass others' work off as their own can be subject to harsh
sanctions, up to and including automatic failure of courses and, ultimately, expulsion from the
university," she said.
