However, its former owner is not ready to leave, writes John Lewis.

AUSTRALIAN Vintage Ltd (AVL) has sold the Barossa Valley Yaldara winery and brand for $15.5
million to 1847 Winery, a company owned by Sydney-based Chinese interests.

AVL will retain the prime 41-hectare Yaldara vineyard and will continue to process its grapes in the
10,000-tonne grape-crush-capacity Yaldara winery for two years.

Neil McGuigan, AVL's CEO-chief winemaker, told me last week that during those two years, AVL would
explore various options for the long-term processing of its grapes from the Barossa, Adelaide Hills and
other South Australian areas.

A key objective in the deal had been to keep the Yaldara vines, which included a planting he had
initiated of the classic Italian red variety montepulciano.

He believed the grape had a great future in Australia and this had been borne out recently when the
McGuigan 2013 Shortlist Montepulciano won a 56-point gold medal and the trophy for the best
2013-14 other varieties dry red at the 2014
Cowra Wine Show.

The deal gives 1847 Winery nine hectares of vines next to the winery and Yaldara's portfolio of fortified
wines. Settlement was subject to 1847 obtaining a liquor licence for the winery, which was expected to
occur towards the end of the year.
Neil said AVL currently employed 16 staff on-site at Yaldara and employment would be offered to
some of these employees by 1847 Winery after settlement.
AVL would retain two of its senior winemakers, who would continue to produce the company's
super-premium wine on-site during the next two years.
He said the $15.5 million proceeds of the sale of the winery and brand would initially be used to
reduce AVL's debt.

Yaldara was established in 1947 by German winemaker, Hermann Thumm, and became part of what
is now AVL in 2002.
The property at Lyndoch, which has a magnificent chateau-style cellar door and function rooms, has
long been a major tourist magnet in the Barossa.

Paringa wins recommendation

Estate into one of Australia's top boutique producers, will preside over tastings of his wines in
Newcastle on Saturday.

The tastings will be held between 11.30am and 1pm at the Lambton Fridge, 86 Elder Street, Lambton.
Wine guru James Halliday has given Paringa five red stars in his Australian Wine Companion and has
special praise for the pinot noir and shiraz.

Memories of Miamba return
THE Grant Burge 2012 Miamba Shiraz reviewed today in Wine List recalls a fondly remembered red
brand of the past. I enjoyed many an Orlando Miamba shiraz in the 1960s and 1970s. But the Miamba
vineyard had been ripped out when Grant Burge bought the land in 1983. He replanted vines, bringing
the site back to its former glory.

McLeish success continues
BOB McLeish reckons the McLeish Estate 2007 Cellar Reserve Semillon has established a position as
the most awarded, premier semillon in Australia.
Speaking in Sydney after he was he was presented on Friday with 2014 Australian Boutique Wine
Awards trophies for the best semillon and the best white wine, he said his family company had made
2014 a milestone year by winning seven trophies with its whites.
