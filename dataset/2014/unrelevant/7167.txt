Mining minnow Padbury Mining said Wednesday it had scrapped an agreement to develop the large
Oakajee port and rail project in Western Australia.
The company — which had a market capitalization of around $68 million when its shares were still
trading — shocked the iron ore sector April 11 when it said it had raised the $6 billion necessary to
fund the project from a group of private equity investors. That announcement sent its share price
soaring, and ASX ordered a trading halt.

The financing was to be provided by Alliance Super Holdings Pty Ltd and Superkite Pty Ltd in three
tranches. However, Padbury said in a regulatory filing Wednesday the agreement with the parties had
been terminated.

"Padbury will continue to actively explore all available opportunities to exploit its existing intellectual
property with respect to the Oakajee project," it added, without elaborating.
Oakajee would have a capacity of 35 million-45 million of iron ore if it were successfully developed,
unlocking reserves in Australia's Mid West.

However, all attempts to develop the infrastructure have so far been unsuccessful. Murchison Metals
and Japan's Mitsubishi Development were awarded the right to build and operate the new port and rail
infrastructure in July 2008, after beating the China-backed Yilgarn consortium in a two-way tender.
But Perth-based Murchison proved unable to fund its half of the $6 billion project, forcing it to sell out
to its Japanese partner. Mitsubishi and the West Australian government then tried to lure Chinese
investment but failed, despite Sinosteel owning an asset in the region.

Padbury is developing the Peak Hill magnetite project in the Mid West region, which could potentially
produce as much as 10 million mt/year of iron ore, but requires the Oakajee port and rail project to be
built to be viable.
