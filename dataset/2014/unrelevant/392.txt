Overnight Markets Update

TD

------------------------

US Treasuries moves were modest as Fed Chair Janet Yellen said little new on her second day of
testimony to Congress. The curve flattened as the 2-year yield rose a modest 1bp to 0.48% while the
10-year yield was flat at 2.53%.

Australian bond futures continue to underperform US Treasuries.
Both the implied 3- and 10-year bonds sold off, with yields rising 1bp to 2.56% and 3.44% respectively.

European equities rallied strongly, with Portuguese banking stocks gaining on comments from the Bank of
Portugal that Banco Espirito Santo SA may raise EUR2bn to strengthen its capital ratios. The Euro Stoxx
50 rose 1.6% to 3,203, the German DAX increased 1.4% to 9,859 and the UK FTSE finished the session
1.1% higher to close at 6,785.
US equities gained, supported by M&A activity and some solid earnings reports. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%
to 1,982 and the Nasdaq closed 0.2% higher at 4,426. The Dow Jones closed at a record high, up 0.5% to
17,138.

Australian SPI futures gained 0.3% overnight to 5,491.

In currency markets there was little follow through in the USD strength and familiar ranges remained
intact. The AUD ended the day unchanged after some early weakness, but rallied solidly against the NZD.
There, a soft CPI outcome together with the weaker dairy auction soured sentiment and pushed the NZD
lower across the board.
The data in China was better than expected, bu ` t had little impact on markets. Looking ahead, ranges
are likely to remain intact as the data calendar quietens down.

Indicative trading levels: AUD 0.9367, AUD/EUR 0.6926, AUD/GBP 0.54659, AUD/NZD 1.0746, AUD/JPY
95.238, AUD/CNY 5.8117, EUR/USD 1.3524, GBP/USD 1.7136, USD/JPY 101.69.

Oil prices rose overnight, as WTI futures gained 1.0% to USD101.44 per barrel following a drop in US
crude stockpiles, while Brent futures edged 0.1% higher to USD107.16 per barrel.

The spot gold price rebounded from the three-week low reached in the previous session, rising 0.3%
overnight to USD1,298.5 after an increase in imports by India.

Base metals prices largely declined overnight. Copper (-1.0%), nickel (-0.7%), lead (-0.8%) and zinc
(-0.5%) all fell, while aluminium (+0.4%) continued to rise, reaching a 16-month high last night on reports
of weak stockpiles. The spot iron ore price remained largely unchanged at USD98.0 per tonne, while
thermal coal futures slid -1.8% lower to close at USD67.1 per tonne.

weeks following signs of increased demand for US exports, as corn (+0.3%), palm oil (+2.5%) and canola
(+1.2%) also rose. Cocoa (-1.2%) experienced its largest drop in almost two months, while wheat (-0.5%),
sugar (-0.8%) and cotton (-0.2%) also declined. ` Key drivers

----------- * European equities rallied strongly overnight, led by a relief rally in Portuguese bank stocks and
encouraging activity data from China. The move higher in US equities was a little more muted, although
the S & P approached record highs.

Currency markets were mixed, with the euro and pound weakening against the dollar but the AUD and
NZD both clawing back some ground after yesterday's falls.

Dallas Fed President (and 2014 FOMC voter) Richard Fisher gave his views on the outlook for US
monetary policy. Fisher believes the Fed could start shrinking its balance sheet in October and start
raising the fed funds rate in early 2015 (consistent with the median FOMC voter), but worries that the Fed
may be "staying too loose for too long".
In terms of US data, industrial production rose 0.2% m/m in June (mkt: +0.3% m/m) after increasing 0.5%
m/m in May.

According to the Federal Reserve, the rise in Q2 industrial production was the strongest in four years
(5.5% annualised). Forward-looking indicators, such as the PMI new orders sub-indices, suggest the
expansion in output and production has further to run in the US. The NAHB survey was stronger than
expected in July at 53, compared to 49 in June (mkt: 50).
Meanwhile, the headline PPI series rose 0.4% m/m and 1.9% y/y in June. The Federal Reserve's July
Beige Book reported an expansion in activity across all districts for the second consecutive time,
consistent with activity data during Q2. Most districts reported that wages pressure remained modest, with
the exception of some skilled positions. * The UK labour force report for May was somewhat mixed. While
the employment data for the three months May were positive, markets initially focused on the
disappointing average earnings growth of 0.3% y/y in the three months to May, which underscores the
risk of a non-inflationary recovery in the broader economy. Ex-bonuses, however, earnings were a touch
stronger at 0.7% y/y. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.5% from 6.6% and the economy created 254k
jobs in the three months to May. * Yesterday, China's Q2 GDP growth was a touch stronger than
expected at 2.0% q/q and 7.5% y/y (mkt: 1.8% q/q; 7.4% y/y). Pro-growth fiscal policies, improving
external demand, and selective reserve requirement ratio cuts to about 40% of the banking system have
played some part in stabilising the economy recently.

Meanwhile, industrial production rose 9.2% y/y in June (mkt: 9.0% y/y), while retail sales increased 12.4%
y/y (mkt: 12.5% y/y) and fixed asset investment rose 17.3% y/y (mkt: 17.2% y/y). * In New Zealand
yesterday, CPI rose 0.3% q/q in Q2, slightly below the market consensus (0.4%) but in line with the
RBNZ's forecast. What was surprising to us (and likely the RBNZ) was how tame domestically generated
inflation readings were - as flagged by our monthly inflation gauge, with few signs of a generalised pick-up
in prices.

ANZ forecasts the RBNZ to hike the policy rate in July and then pause until at least the end of the year to
assess the activity and pricing outlook.
