Markets are trading quietly higher in Asia after the Portugal bank driven jitters had subsided in Europe and
the US last Friday.

"I think we will be up 5 points in a quiet day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "There has been a fair bit of volatility in Europe late week,
probably on t he back of Portugal and also the data out of Germany and the greater Euro area not being
overly fantastic of late.

"The DAX was trading a little over the 10,000 mark, which ha seen fairly strong reistance over the last few
months. It came crashing down quite significantly in line with the pick up in volatility. The German market
has fallen 400 points, or 4% over the last week. The moving averages, particularly the 20 day has turned
bearish. The DAX should see support at 9600. A break would see a gain in momentum of the downtrend it
is now in.
"Asian indexes last week were relatively quiet. Ther was a bit of profit taking in Japan. The Chinese
market is still stuck in a fairly tight range at the moment, you would probably say the charts are neutral.
There is really good support on the Chinese market at 2035 and a lot of resistance at 2065. Those are a
couple of levels to watch.

The Japanese market is probably threatening a bearish break down with the price action we saw there on
Thursday and Friday. It has broken below the20 day moving average. However there is good support
around current levels.

"The S&P 500 picked up in volatility as well on Thursday when intra day the market spiked down. The
market still regained some of these losses and managed to close above the trend line and 20 day moving
average.

Page76of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."It is still in a good uptrend. However momentum has certainly started and resistance remains probably
now at 1985. Support is at 1960 on the S&P. there could be some downside in the S&P.

"I will make the observation that as with the European markets, if you see volatility spiking like that it could
be a precursor for a potential pullback.

"Looking at our market, volatility is picking up a bit here. We had a very strong day on Friday, also in the
US and Europe.

"There is good underlying buying support in our market but on pretty low volume. The chart for us is pretty
neutral. Resistance is at 5525, strong support is still at 5440.

The moving averages are still trending slightly positive. The RSI is neutral at the moment.

"For the week we would need to close above 5440 - the bulls would like to see us above 5500 again.

"Given we had a pretty strong day on Friday, I think we will be up 5 points in a quiet day. Its going to be an
interesting week - watch that volatility".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 22.4 points to 5486.8 on Friday.

*DJS: 97% of shareholders voted in favor of t/o, Solly Lew abstained

ABC News reports Woolworths' David Jones takeover has cleared a major hurdle, as around 97 per cent
of the company's shareholders voted in favour of the $2.2 billion offer from South Africa's Woolworths.
Just over 51 per cent of the company's shares, held by around 31 per cent of shareholders, were voted
by proxy and 96.5 per cent of these votes were in favour of the deal.

Those voting in person largely maintained that trend, resulting in an overwhelming vote in support of the
takeover.

Today's vote follows an advertising campaign by David Jones to encourage retail shareholders to vote for
the deal, but most big institutional shareholders were in support, making the takeover likely to succeed
anyway.

The favorable SPA outcome provides a binding agreement from the FDA that the phase 3 clinical study
design, endpoints, statistical analyses and other aspects of the planned studies adequately address
objectives in support of a US regulatory submission for approval of the product.

The grant of SPA agreement by the FDA follows the earlier agreement of the European Medicines Agency
on the design of the phase 3 studies.

Starpharma will now commence its two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials of VivaGel for the prevention of
recurrent BV at sites in North America, Europe and Asia.

The two |(00)phase 3 double blind, randomised placebo controlled trials will be identical in design and will
compare the rate of BV recurrence in women using VivaGel to the rate of recurrence in women using a
placebo gel during a 16 week treatment period.

Approximately 600 women will be recruited into each study.

CEO Dr Jackie Fairley said in the report, "SPA agreement from the FDA is protected by US law and gives
Starpharma certainty and confidence that the studies will support a regulatory submission for the approval
of VivaGel for the prevention of recurrent BV in the US".

*ABY: Ramp up commences at Birla Nifty

Aditya Birla Mineral Ltd advised that subsequent to the lifting of the Prohibition Notice by the Department
of Mines and Petroleum as announced on July 7, it has completed the detailed stoping, development and
production schedule for the Birla Nifty mine to recommence mining activities whilst ensuring the safety of
its employees.
While the operations will not achieve optimal levels during the first few months of the ramp up, the
company will strive to become financially viable during the course of the remainder of the year.
The company's quarterly activities report will include details of the cash burn throughout the shutdown
period and remaining cash holdings.

*CTR: Further testing of Atzam #5/ Schlumberger completes logging data
Citation Resources Ltd advised testing operations are set to recommence on the Atzam #5 well in
Guatemala with the immediate program to be focused on the C18 carbonates located behind production
casing above the final casing point at 3,600 ft. The testing program was recently delayed whilst
Schlumberger sourced and delivered a lager 7 inch perforaton gun from Mexico to location that will enable
more of the targeted carbonate sections to be opened up to the wellbore to help evaluate the commercial
flow rate potential of each zone.
All potential commercial pay zones will be perforated and tested in this ongoing program until a zone
produces at material commercial rates. On success such a zone would then be put on producton like the
C17 producing zone in Atzam #4 that continues to produce under natural reservoir pressure at
approximately 170 bopd. Review of the Atzam #5 log data confirms the well has very similar reservoir
characteristics to Atzam #4.

The full suite of logging data and reports from Schlumberger have been passed on to Ralph Davis who are
completing a reserve report for Atzam $5 and resource estimates for the Atzam field. (CTR 60% of Latin
American who own the Atzam licence).

*MRP: Prelim Nimbus-Boorara Ag/Au/Zn DFS more encouraging than PFS

McPhersons Resources advised preliminary findings of the bankable feasibility study on its
Nimbus-Boorara silver-gold-zinc project near Kalgoorlie point to both capital and operating costs being
significantly lower than those contained in the pre-feasibility study.

The study which is on track for completion in the September quarter 2014 shows that the lower costs not
only have the potential to boost margins, but could also result in the cut off grades being reduced.

Deep drilling has intersected both strike and depth extensions of currently known mineralisation as well as
identifying new zones.

*PIR: Merger with B2Gold, Fekola resource unchanged/satellites upgraded

Fekola Papillon Resources Ltd in its June quarter report highlights during the quarter included the merger
with B2Gold Corp to combine the two companies at an agreed exchange ratio of 0.661 B2Gold shares for
each Papillon shares held, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

If the scheme is implemented, PIR shareholder will hold approximately 26% of the merged entity while still
retaining material exposure to the upside potential of the company's Fekola Project in south western Mali.

At the Fekola project additional metallurgical test work has been completed as part of the DFS, supporting
the previous decision to implement a conventional primary crush, semi-autogenous grinding and ball mill
circuit and a gravity concentration and a carbon in leach on gravity tails processing flowsheet for Fekola.
The Fekola updated Main Zone MRE resource of 5.15 million ozs at a lower cut off grade of 1gpt Au
remains unchanged since last reported. The updated Fekola Satellites MRE is now 0.38 million ozs at a
lower cut off grade of 1 gpt Au.

Follow up drilling at the Menankoto Sud Project, located approximately 13 km to the north of the Fekola
project, continues to yield extremely encouraging results including 10m grading 4.61gpt Au from 12m, 30m
grading 2.01gpt Au from 13m and 7m grading 3.22gpt Au from 40m.

*THX: Up to 31.3%Cu, 2.6gpt Au, 34.2gptAg in recent drilling at Red Bore Thundelarra Ltd announced it
has completed a further two diamond drill holes at its 90% owned Red Bore prospect (M52/597) in

Page81of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Western Australia's Doolgunna region. These holes were designed to help define the geometry and to
increaset he known extent of the brecciated magmatic feed er pipes discovered in the first stage drill
program, announced on May 16.

The highest intercept is for 1m at 31.3% Cu, 2.6gpt Au, 34.2gpt Ag from 36m. High grade mineralisation
continues beyond the existing resource envelope. One definite and a possible second feeder pipe has
be3en identified.

Approval has been received from the DMP for follow up program of work.

*TNG: 3way MOU with Hyundai for investment, offtake re. Mt Peake + other

TNG Ltd announced it has signed a three way MOU with Hyundai Steel Co Ltd, part of the Hyundai
Automotive Group paving the way for a potentially company making funding, development and
construction arrangement for its flagship Mount Peake Vanadium Project in the Northern Territory.
The MOU encompasses a cornerstone investment in TNG, potential offtake for the iron products from
TNG's Mount Peake project and includes consideration of TNG's other resource projects.
