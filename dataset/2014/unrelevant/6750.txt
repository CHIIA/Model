'Analysts question Gindalbie's ability to survive much longer.'

The spectacular decline of magnetite developer Gindalbie Metals has accelerated, with the struggling
miner reporting a $640 million write-down of its stake in the Karara project. In a move that virtually
removes any value for the company's stake in the magnetite project, Gindalbie said the impairment was
warranted given a lower than expected iron ore price, a higher than expected Australian dollar, and
Karara's under-performance. Gindalbie's stake in Karara was valued at about $550 million in the
company's 2013 full-year accounts. At that time, Gindalbie owned 50 per cent of the project, but its
inability to pay for its share of development has resulted in itsChinese partner Ansteel diluting Gindalbie's
stake to 47.84 per cent. Ansteel has an option to further
dilute Gindalbie's stake to 38 per cent, and it is expected to proceed with this soon. Monday's
re-evaluation continues the apparent slow death of Gindalbie, which was worth more than $2 billion less
than four years ago. In January 2011, Gindalbie shares were worth $1.47. On Monday they lost another
1.1ï¿½ to only 4.7ï¿½. The company now has a market capitalisation of only $70 million. Gindalbie was
hampered by cost and time blowouts on the construction of Karara, which was designed to make a
high-grade magnetite concentrate from lower-grade iron deposits near Geraldton, Western Australia.
The company has since been

gutted of most its staff, and analysts are questioning its ability to survive for much longer. Karara was one
of two magnetite projects being developed in WA by Chinese steelmakers. The other
was the disastrous Sino Iron project, which ran billions of dollars over budget and several years behind
schedule, before finally coming into production about eight months ago.
