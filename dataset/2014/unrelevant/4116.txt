Sydney - Monday - April 14 (RWE) - ASF Group Limited (ASX: AFA) report on the commencement of an
exploration program on the Cracow Project held by Civil & Mining Resources Pty Ltd ("CMR").

ASF wishes to clarify that announcement and attaches an updated Report with further details.

In addition ASF retracts the statement which refers to the estimated exploration target of 40-60 million
tonnes.

ASF will provide a revised estimate when it has obtained it from CMR following details of the proposed
drilling project later in the year.

held by ASF Resources Limited, a 53.69% owned subsidiary of ASF.
CMR, trading as CMR Coal, is a coal exploration company incorporated in Queensland.
The major assets of CMR comprise 26 Exploration Permits for Coal (EPCs), totaling 13,647km2 of land

proximity to operating mines, infrastructure and proven economic coal resources.

Australia.

Since its transformation into a Sino-Australian investment and trading house in 2006, ASF has focused
principally on the identification, incubation and realisation of opportunities across various industries
including energy, resource, property, finance and tourism.

CMR's Cracow Project comprises two EPC's (2386 & 2421), covering a total area of 370km2 overlaying
the eastern margin of the Bowen Basin near Moura and the Port of Gladstone.

CMR have begun the initial phases of their exploration program with a SkyTEM aerial geophysics survey
over three prospective areas in the Cracow Project.
