GRANGE Resources' sales revenues spiked in the December quarter as the Savage River miner
got back into better iron ore grades.
Grange recorded about $95.9 million in sales revenues in the quarter, based on sales tonnage and
price figures in the company's quarterly report.

That was up from about $78.3 million in the September quarter and well ahead of $66.8million in
the December quarter of 2012.

It averaged price per tonne of $161.42 for the quarter, up from $145.87 in the September quarter.

Managing director Wayne Bould said Grange had delivered December quarter production on target
and on time.
"During the quarter, we continued to leverage our return to higher grade ore in the North Pit to mine
and produce 632,906 tonnes of iron ore products at an annualised rate in excess of 2.5 million
tonnes per annum, with grade averaging 46 per

cent," Mr Bould said.

"This was achieved while maintaining our unwavering focus on workplace safety and holding true to
our promise in June 2013 to get back to the basics of disciplined planning, focused operational
management and execution processes to produce

products at cost levels which will remain competitive in the long term.

"We also saw the return of stronger interest in quality high grade pellet products from our core
Chinese market.

"This supported the return of a more realistic pellet premium, resulting in Grange achieving an
average sale price of $US149.39 ($161.42) per tonne.

"There is strong sentiment in the market that this situation will prevail in 2014."

Grange said the quarter capped a difficult, transitional year.

"As we move into 2014, Grange has recovered from the June 2012 (pit) wall failure, regained
access to the high grade main ore zone in the North Pit and returned production to planned
annualised rates.

"At current operating levels we expect to generate solid cash flows through 2014."

Pellet production rose by about 39 per cent for the quarter.
