Global real estate groupSavills aims to expand its prime residential network both in Australia and
around the world.
"There is much more blurring today between residential and commercial, investors want both,"
Savills chief executive Jeremy Helsby said.

His London-listed group last week unveiled a strong 2013 result, with revenue at a record high of
£904.8 million ($1.64 billion) and after-tax profit up 38.5 per cent to £51.4 million.
The growth was driven by a big surge in commercial and residential sales, particularly in Britain.
Global revenue from commercial transactions rose 11 per cent to £217.5 million, which was
enough to deliver a 71.5 per cent jump in pre-tax profit.
In the residential sector, revenue rose 21.8 per cent to £140.7 million with underlying pre-tax profit
up 32 per cent.

Mr Helsby said Britain had grown strongly on the back of increased international inflows of
investment capital.
"In the UK we acted on over 40 per cent of transactions involving Asian or Middle Eastern
investors," he said.Asia-Pacific rise

Asia-Pacific, where Savills employs 22,000 people across 44 offices, delivered a 7 per cent rise in
revenue.
Mr Helsby said in commercial property, "substantially increased earnings in Australia, Korea and
Japan", had offset a 19 per cent fall in revenue from Hong Kong.
In the residential sector, Asia-Pacific revenue rose 23 per cent, due to activity in, and between,
Australia and China.

Savills chief executive in Australia and New Zealand Paul McLean said his business had its best year
since 2007. Savills has about 800 staff in Australia and the country produces about 5 per cent to 10
per cent of global revenue.

Mr McLean acknowledged that local leasing was soft but said the rest of his operations had
performed better than had been expected.

"We expect continued growth in 2014 in capital markets," he said.
"There is an inflow of Asian capital and strong activity amongst the Australian Real Estate Investment
Trusts."

2014.

Project marketing is the focus.
Savills will market the 770 apartments on the site it sold to an Asian developer in Parramatta. Mr
McLean predicted more appointments to come.

"We have high leverage in Asia, which provides us with a strong competitive edge," he said.
Mr Helsby predicted further demand for London property but weakness in Hong Kong in the first
half. Globally, Savills aims to expand its cross-border investment advisory activity, enhance its
occupier services business, further build investment management, and grow in the United States.
Savills, which has a market cap of £859.18 million, will soon open in Indonesia.
