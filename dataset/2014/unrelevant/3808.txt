Synopsis

This report provides detailed market analysis,
information and insights into the Australian construction
industry including:

-- The Australian construction industry's growth
prospects by market, project type and type of
construction activity

-- Analysis of equipment, material and service costs
across each project type within Australia

-- Critical insight into the impact of industry trends and
issues, and the risks and opportunities they present to
participants in the Australian construction industry

-- Analyzing the profiles of the leading operators in the
Australian construction industry

-- Data highlights of the largest construction projects in
Australia

Summary

The Australian construction industry registered a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.24% during
the review period (2009--2013). Growth was supported
by private and public investments in infrastructure,
industrial and residential construction projects.
Government infrastructure programs such as the Nation
Building Program and the National Broadband Network
supported the growth. Industry growth is expected to
continue over the forecast period (2014--2018) as a
result of the government's commitment to making
infrastructural improvements. Consequently, industry

Key Highlights

-- Since late 2012, construction activity in Australia has
been fairly weak, with the industry posting a contraction
of 0.2% in real value-added terms in 2013. This followed
an annual average growth of 6.8% in real terms in
2011?2012. However, potential growth has emerged in
the form of the total building permits for dwelling units
reaching 51,417 in the fourth quarter of 2013, a growth
of 23.2% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Permits for
houses rose by 14.7%, whereas permits (excluding
houses) grew by 33.8% during the same period. The
forecast-period outlook for construction in Australia
remains positive due to low interest and unemployment
rates and improvements in consumer and investor
confidence.

-- The government's focus on road and rail infrastructure
development is expected to support economic growth
and improve regional connectivity. In its 2013--2014
budget, the government allocated AUD24.0 billion
(US$23.3 billion) under the Nation Building Program to
expand the country's road, rail and port infrastructure by
2018--2019.

Page105of266©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.-- According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS),
the seasonally adjusted number of permits for total
dwelling and non-residential units combined in
February 2014 measured 16,669, an increase of 23.2%
compared with February 2013. According to the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the supply of new
housing units per year is 154,000, whereas the country
needs around 170,000 units, based on an average
population growth of 1.6% a year. Over the forecast
period, growth in the residential market will be driven by
the need to balance housing unit demand and supply.

-- The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its policy interest
rate to a record low of 2.5% in September 2013, a level
at which it has remained. This helped to support an
improvement in business confidence across various
sectors, which is expected to contribute to demand for
office buildings. Moreover, the higher yield on asset
prices, better leasing conditions and the recovery of the
Australian real estate investment trust has helped
attract investors to purchase office buildings. As a
result, the office buildings category is expected to
expand over the forecast period.

-- Various challenges such as decisions by Ford and GM
in 2013 to shut down their manufacturing operations by
2017, a decline in new orders, tough competition in the
international market and the slowing resource market
due to slowing down of the industrial growth in the
Chinese economy have all affected the Australian
manufacturing industry. As a result, the manufacturing
plants category is likely to grow at a slower pace over
the forecast period.
