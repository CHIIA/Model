Moody's Investors Service says the Australian auto ABS performance was stable in July 2014 compared
with June 2014, with delinquencies in excess of 30 days decreasing marginally to 1.0% from 1.1%.

In addition, the Australian prime RMBS performance was stable in July 2014 compared with June 2014,
with delinquencies in excess of 30 days remaining at 1.4%.

The Australian prime RMBS performance compares favourably with other markets. For example, its
60-day-plus delinquency rate was 0.8% in July 2014, compared with over 5% observed in US RMBS.

These figures were presented in Moody's just-released report titled "Global Structured Finance Collateral
Performance Review."

Moody's says its outlook on Australian ABS and RMBS performance remains stable, despite an expected
incremental rise in delinquencies.

"Our stable outlook is underpinned by our economic forecasts for modest GDP growth of 2.5%-3.5%, an
ongoing low cash rate of around 2.5%, and a broadly stable unemployment rate of 5.5%-6.5%," says
Noirit Zaman, a Moody's Associate Analyst.
