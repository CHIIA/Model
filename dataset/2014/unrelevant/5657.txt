SYDNEY, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Australia's competition watchdog said on Thursday it will not oppose
Wilmar International Ltd's and First Pacific Co Ltd's proposed acquisition of edible oil supplier
Goodman Fielder Ltd as it did not raise competition concerns.
Wilmar and the Hong Kong investment firm plan to pay A$1.3 billion ($1.2 billion) for the struggling
Australasian food firm that sells packaged edible oil under the Crisco and Gold'N Canola brands.

"Industry feedback also suggested that packaged vegetable oil is considered a commodity product
with low levels of brand loyalty, making it easier for retailers to bypass their existing suppliers," Rod
Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said in a statement.
