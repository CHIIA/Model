The Australian sharemarket has pushed higher, with broad gains across sectors, including the major
miners and banks, despite another slump in the price of iron ore.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 61.4 points, or 1.2 per cent, to close at the day's high of 5396.2.
The broader All Ordinaries rose 59.4 points, or 1.1 per cent to 5324.1.

The Australian dollar plunged to a four-year low overnight on Tuesday, falling more than 1 per cent. It
recovered marginally in the local session to US85.35¢.

The fall was sparked by comments from Reserve Bank of Australia deputy governor Philip Lowe
suggesting the currency was still too high and that the RBA still had the option of cutting interest rates
to help stimulate growth.

JBWere executive director Mike Kendall said the fall in the Australian dollar, Dr Lowe's comments and
a view that shares had been a bit oversold helped shares lift on Wednesday. "I think it's those factors
that are leading investors to dip their toes into the water today but it's still a very choppy market," Mr
Kendall said.
The price of iron ore fell under $US70 per tonne for the first time in more than five years, with
concerns about the Chinese property market and oversupply continuing to weigh on the steel-making
ingredient.
Iron ore has slumped more than 49 per cent this calendar year.

Despite this, Rio Tinto shares finished Wednesday 1.7 per cent higher at $58.39, while rival BHP
Billiton gained 1.3 per cent to $32.53.
Iron ore pure-play Fortescue Metals slipped 0.7 per cent to $2.79, BC Iron rose 2.6 per cent to 48.5¢
and Atlas Iron sunk 4.9 per cent to 19.5¢.

Among financials, Westpac lifted 1.4 per cent to $33.07 and Commonwealth Bank rose 1.1 per cent to
$81.01. National Australia Bank finished 1 per cent higher at $32.46 and ANZ gained 0.9 per cent to
$32.38.

Medibank Private, on its second day of trading, fell 1.9 per cent to $2.10.

Webjet shares slipped 1.3 per cent to $3.10 after it warned that the domestic travel market is likely to
remain flat for the rest of the current financial year.

Cabcharge shares lifted 2.3 per cent to $4.86, after director Rodney Gilmour resigned on Wednesday
morning.

7.7 million shares. Tabcorp shares finished Wednesday 0.2 per cent lower at $4.16.
Ausdrill shares plunged 10.9 per cent to 45¢ after after one of its clients, Resolute Mining said it plans
to defer expansion work at one of its miners. Resolute Mining shares posted the biggest gains among
the top 200, rising 19.6 per cent to 28¢.
