Integrated engineering and services provider Thiess Pty. Ltd. said May 28 that Samsung C&T awarded it
a A$330 million contract to construct the mine process plant facilities for Hancock Prospecting Group's
70% owned Roy Hill iron ore project in Western Australia.

The contract includes construction of the structural, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation
works which are being designed and supplied by Samsung. Thiess expects work to begin onsite in July
and generate up to 1,000 jobs for about 14 months.

As previously reported, mining recently commenced at the A$10.7 billion Roy Hill project. On
completion, the project will produce 55 million tonnes per annum of iron ore.
Marubeni Corp. holds a 15% stake in the project, POSCO has a 12.5% stake, and the remaining 2.5%
interest is owned by China Steel Australia Ltd. Samsung C&T is the lead contractor of the project.
