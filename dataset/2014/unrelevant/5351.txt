Aquila Resources has received a $3.40-cash-per-share takeover proposal from its major shareholder
Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and Aurizon Operations. The offer price values Aquila at $1.4 billion, with
shares to be allocated between Baosteel s local arm, Baosteel Resources Australia, and Aurizon
Operations, which is a owned subsidiary of Aurizon Holdings. Aurizon will own up to 15% of Aquila
shares, with Baosteel owning all the remaining Aquila shares acquired under the offer. Baosteel invested
in Aquila through a strategic placement in 2009 then bought shares late last year taking its stake in the
Australian listed company to 19.8%. Since making the initial investment, the company had confidential
discussions with the Baosteel group about its potential direct investment in the West Pilbara Iron Ore
Project, in which Aquila Resources owns a 50% stake.

The unsolicited proposal to acquire Aquila is a new development, with Baosteel and Aurizon electing to go
straight to shareholders with the offer. Aquila will form an independent board sub-committee to consider
and evaluate the Proposal and any resulting takeover offer and will update shareholders in due course.
Baosteel Resources International chairman, Zhihao Dai, said that the acquisition of Aquila supported
Baosteel s strategy in building out its global integrated business through the development of the West
Pilbara Iron Ore Project and the Eagle Downs Hard Coking Coal Project in Queensland s Bowen Basin,
in which Aquila also has a 50% stake.
