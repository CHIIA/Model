While Chinese firms including Baosteel Group Corporation have been working toward to impound
excellent coal assets, several Japanese firms have been acquiring coal assets in Australia, etc. one after
the other for these two months or so.
Firstly, Sumitomo Corporation obtained the interest in Clermont coal mine, a large-size thermal coal mine
in the State of QLD in cooperation with Glencore plc on June 2.

GS Coal Pty Ltd in which Sumitomo and Glencore have a 50% investment respectively has obtained a
50.1% interest in Clermont coal mine from Rio Tinto plc. The interest purchase amount is a total of
US$1.015 billion.
Accordingly, the interest in Clermont coal mine has been 50.1% owned by GS Coal, 31.4% by Mitsubishi
Corporation, 15.0% by J-Power and 3.5% by Japan Coal Development Co., Ltd. (JCD).
In this regard, Sumitomo and Glencore indirectly have a 25.05% interest respectively in Clermont coal
mine through GS Coal.
Clermont coal mine is an opencast thermal coal mine in the Bowen Basin, QLD and the production
volume of saleable coal in FY2012/13 ( one year ending on 30 June 2013) was 10.287 million tons, and
the coal export volume was 9.968 million tons, of which 4.824 million tons was exported to Japan.
What's more, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. acquired 12% of shares in PT Mitrabara Adiperdana (MA), a coal
mining company in Indonesia on July 10.
MA is an affiliated company of Baramulti Group, a mining company in Indonesia and now running
Malinau opencast coal mine in the North Kalimantan.
The type of coal produced at Malinau coal mine is low-sulfur, low-ash subbituminous coal (Sul: 0.15%,
Ash: 3.5% and CV: 5,500kcal/kg), and 2.5 million tons of coal is expected to be produced in 2014.
Furthermore from 2015 onwards, the production volume is supposed to be fortified to 4Mtpa.
Idemitsu Kosan obtained 3% of shares in PT Baramulti Saksessarana Tbk, an affiliated company of
Baramulti Group in November 2012. The Company is now running Antang Gunung Meratus (AGM) coal
mine in the South Kalimantan.
The type of coal produced at AGM coal mine is low-sulfur, low-ash subbituminous coal, and the coal
production volume will be lifted to over 7Mtpa in the future.

Idemitsu Kosan has a thought of further strengthening the relationship with Baramulti Group based on
acquisition of shares in MA and expanding the export of coal produced by this group predominantly to
Japan and other Asian countries.
In the meantime, on May 16, Sojitz Corporation made an agreement with U&D Coal Limited, Australia to
set up a joint venture (JV) for the purpose to promote Meteor Downs South project (MDS project) in QLD
on a conjoint basis.

U&DCoal in the Bowen Basin, QLD. At this mining area, 1.5Mtpa of thermal coal is expected to be
produced.
Sojitz will be able to obtain a 50% interest in MDS project by bearing coal development cost, etc.
MDS opencast mining area is located 65 km to the southeast of Minerva opencast coal mine run by
Sojitz. In light of the coal resource at Minerva coal mine being depleted in 2018 - 2019, Sojitz plans to
develop several mining areas around this coal mine including MDS opencast mining area.
