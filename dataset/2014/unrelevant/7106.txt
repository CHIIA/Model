WHETHER it was a jump for joy or a leap of faith, Barnaby Joyce's use of a shovel as a pogo stick
made for one of the more interesting sod-turning events seen at Berry in recent times.

Thankfully for the federal Agriculture Minister, the shovel landed in some fertile soil, perhaps symbolic
of the mood surrounding the dairy industry after the recent signing of the China-Australia free trade
agreement.

The ceremony marked the official start on the Berry Rural Co-operative's $2 million milk processing
facility, which will produce dairy products for the co-op's South Coast Dairy brand.
The brand was born 10 years ago in uncertain times for the dairy industry and just as Dairy Farmers
announced it would close its once thriving Bomaderry factory, costing the Shoalhaven 66 jobs.
At the time, the Berry farmers were still supplying the bulk of their milk to Dairy Farmers, but the
co-op's 11 farmers decided to divert about 10 per cent of their output into their own South Coast
brand, to be processed at Picton by dairy farmer John Fairley.
Today, the bulk of the co-op's 7 million litres of milk is sold to another co-operative, Murray
Goulburn, but about 1.3 million litres goes into South Coast Dairy.

Co-op chairman Paul Timbs said having its own processing facility would allow the co-op to use even
more of its own milk and expand on its current range, which is currently stocked in more than 150
locations from Wollongong to as far south as Merimbula.

Initial plans for the processing plant were drawn up four years ago, but the original design of the plant
was substantially smaller than what was now being built, he said.
The plant will be able to process 18,000 litres of milk per day - four times South Coast Dairy's current
requirements.

"So there is the capacity for the plant to increase its operations," Mr Timbs said.

"We are already in discussions for contract processing and bottling with a number of interested
parties.

"The opportunities for growth are endless."

The co-op hopes to have the facility running in June next year, creating seven new jobs and
supporting others.

Mr Joyce said he was following the progress of the facility.

supporting jobs and the farmers in their community," he said.
