SYDNEY--PanAust Ltd. (PNA.AU), reporting a 28% fall in half-year profit, said takeover talks with
China's Guangdong Rising Assets Management were continuing but that it had yet to receive a formal
offer it could recommend to shareholders.

PanAust has allowed Guangdong Rising Assets Management, or Gram, to scrutinize its books despite
rejecting an offer of 2.30 Australian dollars (US$2.14) a share from its largest shareholder as too low. It
has also held talks with other parties about a possible takeover, but there have been no firm bids so
far.

"In order for the PanAust Board to recommend a change of control proposal, both price and
conditionality will be important, including the status of any regulatory approvals," the company said
Thursday.
PanAust, which has a market value of A$1.49 billion, has two producing copper and gold mines in
Laos, and hopes to complete the purchase of the Frieda River copper-and-gold mine in Papua New
Guinea from Glencore PLC (GLEN.LN) this month.
Brisbane-based PanAust reported a profit of US$28.1 million for the six months through June, down
from US$38.9 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. That result reflected lower prices for
the major metals it produces.
The company declared an interim dividend of 3 Australian cents a share, and said its operations are
on track to the meet the upper end of forecast annual output of 65,000 tons to 70,000 tons of copper in
concentrate, and 160,000 troy ounces to 165,000 ounces of gold.
