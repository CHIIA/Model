FORTESCUE Metals Group plans to buy eight huge ships from China for $550 million.
But the world’s fourth biggest iron ore producer says the investment will not affect its strategy to pay
down more than $7 billion in debt.

Chief executive Nev Power said the purchase of eight huge ore carriers, each capable of carrying
250,000 to 260,000 tonnes of ore, would improve loading efficiencies at its shipping hub of Port
Hedland.

“The key benefit for us from having those larger ships is they’re designed specifically to maximise the
output from our berths and from Port Hedland inner harbour,” Mr Power said.

“We expect to see more and more 250,000 tonne ships coming into Port Hedland which will continue to
push up the average ship size through the harbour, improve the efficiency and improve the capacity
and throughput.” Chinese steel makers are the biggest buyers of Fortescue’s iron ore and the eight
ships are expected to account for 12 per cent of the company’s shipping portfolio.

Perth-based Fortescue said there was a relatively limited fleet of large vessels suited to Port Hedland,
which has limited capacity.

“We are encouraging other shipowners and shipping companies to invest in these ships because they
will form a core part of the trade between the Pilbara and Asia,” he said.
The company will pay cash on delivery, which is expected to be between November 2016 and early
2018.Fortescue expects operating costs of vessels to be below market rates for similar sized ships
which are in high demand.
