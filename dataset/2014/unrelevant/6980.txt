SYDNEY--Brazil's JBS SA, the world's biggest meat producer by sales, agreed to buy Australia's Primo
Group for 1.45 billion Australian dollars (US$1.25 billion), as global food companies continue to ramp
up their operations to serve rising Asian demand.
JBS said Friday it had signed a conditional agreement to buy Australia's biggest producer of ham, bacon
and small goods by sales from owners including Affinity Equity Partners. The Asian private-equity firm
bought 70% of Primo in 2011, with the balance remaining in the hands of the founding Lederer family.

The deal will allow JBS to leverage Primo's growing export operations across Asia, including China, JBS
said in a statement.
It comes just days after Australia and China signed a free-trade agreement that eliminates or phases out
tariffs on agricultural imports, including meat and dairy products, into the world's second-biggest
economy.

20 Nov 2014 23:43 ET JBS Buys Australian Meat Producer for $1.25 Billion -- Update

By Ross Kelly
SYDNEY--Brazil's JBS SA, the world's biggest meat producer, bought Australia's Primo Group in a 1.45
billion Australian dollars (US$1.25 billion) deal that will help it sell processed pig meat in China, where
lax food-quality standards are a long-standing concern.
The agreement to buy Australia's biggest ham-and-bacon producer allows JBS to leverage Australia's
reputation for high-quality farm produce at a time when China has been rocked by a spate of food
scandals. Primo currently exports its products to various parts of Asia, including China.
The deal also comes in the same week China and Australia signed a free-trade pact that will immediately
eliminate or phase out a range of tariffs on agricultural imports into the world's second-biggest
economy--including those on processed meat.
JBS is buying Primo from Affinity Equity Partners, an Asian private-equity firm that bought 70% of the
Australian company in 2011 for A$519 million, and from members of the founding Lederer family, who
own the rest.

more than 50 million metric tons of it each year. But concern over conditions in domestic hog farms and
the use of additives in the production of pork and other meats have prompted Beijing to push for
modernization of the meat sector.
The perception of poor quality control, however, still lingers among Chinese consumers, many of whom
prize imported brands and foreign labels believed to maintain higher standards. "Quality concerns are a
fairly strong line that comes out of China," said Angus Gidley-Baird, a Sydney-based animal-proteins
analyst at Rabobank. "There's been a couple of scares over there with their pork."
In one highly publicized incident three years ago, hundreds of people fell ill in central China after eating
meat suspected of containing clenbuterol, an illegal additive that speeds up muscle growth in pigs, but
which can cause headaches, nausea and an irregular heartbeat in humans. And last year, the discovery
of thousands of dead pigs in local rivers around Shanghai highlighted poor farming methods and sparked
several public-health concerns.
What's more, premium-pork products are in high demand among China's rising middle class--a factor
that spurred Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. last year to purchase Smithfield Foods Inc. for $4.7
billion, the biggest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company.

Primo's pork products aren't specifically mentioned in the published version of Australia's free-trade deal
with China, which still requires approval from each country's legislature. But a spokeswoman for
Australia's foreign-affairs-and-trade department confirmed that processed meat was among the products
covered in the pact. "The tariffs on pork and processed meat products will be progressively eliminated
over four years," she said in an emailed statement.

The deal marks JBS's first real move into Australian pig-meat-product manufacturing, an area where it
currently has a limited presence. "There is a vast opportunity for the export of Australian pork-related
small goods--an opportunity that has thus far gone largely untapped," said Brent Eastwood, head of
JBS's Australian operations, in a statement.
