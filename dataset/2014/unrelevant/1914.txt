China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. is in talks with Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd. to buy up to
15% of a liquefied-natural-gas project on Canada's western coast, people familiar with the matter said
Wednesday.

The Pacific Northwest LNG project is an export terminal planned for an undeveloped island in northern
British Columbia, which was acquired by Petronas in 2012 as part of its 5.5 billion Canadian dollar
(US$4.9 billion) purchase of Canada's Progress Energy Resources Corp. The terminal could begin
operating as soon as 2018 and will have the capacity to export 12 million metric tons of LNG a year.

Petronas has been selling stakes in Pacific Northwest LNG's reserves and output to raise funds for its
development, which could cost as much as C$11 billion. The company has sold 10% stakes to Japan
Petroleum Exploration Co. and Indian Oil Corp. and will supply them each with 1.2 million metric tons
of LNG annually from the project. Petronas also has sold a 3% stake to Brunei National Petroleum Co.
in exchange for 3% of Pacific Northwest LNG's annual output.
Petronas has said it would announce the sale of another 15% stake to an Asian buyer by the end of
this month but hasn't disclosed the company. The value of the stake couldn't be determined.
The talks between Petronas and the Chinese company, or Sinopec, come as China looks to double
the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 10% by 2020. The negotiations were first reported by
Reuters news service. Although China has plans to use unconventional fuels such as shale gas,
large-scale production is at least a decade away, creating opportunities for importers of LNG-- a chilled
form of natural gas that can be shipped.
China has yet to begin importing LNG from Canada, but Chinese energy companies are planning to
diversify their LNG supplies, which for now come from only a handful of countries, such as Qatar,
Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The Canadian subsidiary of China's primary offshore energy producer, Cnooc Ltd., last year was
awarded rights to proceed with a terminal to export LNG from Canada's Pacific coast. PetroChina Co.,
China's largest energy producer, is part of a consortium led by Royal Dutch Shell PLC to develop
another Canadian LNG project.

Canada is trying to transform its underdeveloped northern Pacific coast into a hub for LNG by using a
glut of natural gas. The Canadian government also has been trying to shift gas exports away from the
saturated U.S. market and into LNG-hungry Asian markets.
If a deal between Sinopec and Petronas is reached, it would be the Chinese company's first entry into
a Canadian LNG project. Sinopec in bought ConocoPhillips's stake in Syncrude Canada Ltd., a large
oil-sands producer in northern Alberta, for US$4.65 billion.
