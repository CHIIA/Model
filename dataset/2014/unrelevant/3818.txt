Our market puzzlingly, failed to react to negative news from Gaza, from the dreadful 2nd Malaysian major
plane crash and from China's loan default news with markets mixed overall while gold lost some of its
overnight gain - it could be totally technically driven with people protecting their positions. Eg: Shares
Guildford Coal, now focussed on Mongolia has shown no reaction to an offer for its Australian assests.

Among the majors, AGL has seen no reaction to its calling profit down in 2015 on the cessation of the
carbon tax.
Bloomberg quoted Russell Investment Group, with about $280 billion in ssets under management
Douglas Gordon who told Bloomberg TV "There has been a huge escalation of geopolitical risk. There's a
lot of uncertainty that the market has to digest".

"I will call the market down 30 points for the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans, said, "The move last night on the S&P 500 was very
interesting and obviously negative. It was the first time probably since 20th May that we have had a close
below the 20 day moving average. This has been a good trend line for the S&P.

"It has now broken with the S&P closing below that. If we don't get a relief rally, it looks set for a correction
there. There is initially good support at 1050. It will test it and break it, which could see the S&P come back
to 1900 even. That was very bearish price action last night - the first time since May that it has closed
below the 20 day moving average.
"It was a good rally for gold with the headlines last night prompting the price action. It has broken and
closed above the 20 day moving average to be right on the $1320 support line which is good support, with
$1340 resistance. It could probably trend up to $1340 if we see headlines similar to the headlines now.

Page53of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."For the ASX200, there was a bit of bearish price action yesterday, closing on our lows. The bulls will want
the market to close above 5500 to be happy. 5500 is the critical level of support, which has potential to be
broken today. The market may come back to 5400 if we see some negative action over the day.

"If we don't hold 5500 it will be a bearish close for the week.

"On the day we will test support at 5500 even. Below that 5480 is the next level of support.

"I will call the market down 30 points for the day and expect we will have a bearish close for the week".

NEWS OF THE DAY

Ukraine's pro Russian separatists claim to have shot down the plane

Malaysian plane was carrying 298 people, a Boeing 777, with the call sign MH17, was flying from
Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

In a statement, Malaysia Airlines said MH17 was carrying at least 154 Dutch nationals, 27 Australians, 43
Malaysians (including 15 crew), 12 Indonesians and nine Britons.

Page54of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Other passengers came from Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada, with the nationalities of 41
people not yet confirmed.

An intercepted message was said to confirm pro Russian separatists had shot down the plane.

*Although there was no clear warning from the ICAO - and Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak said the
aircraft's flight route had been declared safe by the ICAO - Reuters reported some international airlines,
including Australia's Qantas Airways and Korea's two major carriers, shifted the route taken by flights
operating over Ukrainian air space months ago amid increasing tensions between Kiev and pro-Moscow
rebels, although more costly in time and money.

The airlines took extra security precautions despite no official ban from regulators on flying through the
area, even as others continued to use the route.

Australia's carbon tax repeal the subject of global negative headlines

"The Age" records headlines in European, Asian and Middle East countries (Canada a notable exception)
reporting the repeal of the carbon tax in Australia as a step backwards and unfailingly adding that Australia
is the world's worst polluter on a per capita basis.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS

*AGK: 2014 u/lying NPAT $561 mln, in line with expec/2015 EBIT down $186m
AGL Energy Ltd advised that based on unaudited results its full year 2014 Underlying Net Profit after Tax
is expected to be in line with market consensus of $561 million.

AGL also advised that removal of the carbon tax from July 1 is expected to reduce 2015 EBIT by a gross
mount of approximately $186 million. This includes ab expected net reduction of approximately $100
million in EBIT in relation to the operations of the Loy Yang A power station due to the cessation of
transitional assistance arrangements associated with the carbon tax. It also includes an expected
reduction in EBIT of approximately $86 million from AGK's renewable energy and gas generation
portfolios due to the expected fall in wholesale electricity prices associated with the removal oft he carbon
tax.

AGL does not expect a recovery in the price of Large Generation Certificates in 2015 to offset the
expected fall in wholesale electricity prices due to the current surplus of certificates and uncertainty
surrounding the ongoing review of the renewable Energy Target by the Federal Government.

AGL also advised its LPG extraction plant at Kurnell will be closing following the announced closure of the
Caltex oil refinery. This will further reduce 2015 EBIT by approximately $14 million.

Full year results will be announced on August 20. Formal guidance for 2015 will be announced on October
23. (Jul 17)
*AIO: Confirms seeking sale of non controlled interest in terminals, logistics biz

Page55of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.as compared to the April to June 2014 quarter prices. Approximately 80% of deliveries in the July to
September 2014 quarter are forecast to be at the new contract prices with the balance at carry over prices,
and subject to actual contract deliveries for the July to September 2014 quarter.
Managing director of Wesfarmers Resources, Stewart Butel said the coal pricing outcome for Curragh's
range of metallurgical coals was in line with recent market price settlements. (Jul 17)

*WES: Jul qtr production at Curragh 4% higher than previous quarter

Wesfarmers Ltd in quarterly production, development and exploration said at Curragh, overburden
removal was 15.5% higher than the previous quarter, largely due to the timing of the planned 11 week
major dragline shutdown which was completed in April 2014.
Coal production for the quarter was 3,334,000 tonnes, 4% higher than the previous quarter. Metallurgical
coal production increased by 1.3% and steaming coal production increased by 11.8% compared to the
previous quarter.
For the 12 months to June 30, metallurgical coal production increased by 19.4% to 8.8 million tonnes and
steaming coal production rose 7.5% to 3.498 million tonnes. The prior comparable period was impacted
by a scheduled mine shutdown and Cyclone Oswald. (Jul 17)

LARGE CAP RESOURCES
*MIN: Record iron ore sales for year
Mineral Resources Ltd announced for the full year it has achieved record iron ore sales of 10.4 million
tonnes up 88% from 2013 and a 4% improvement on guidance of 9.5/10Mt.
Quarterly iron ore shipments of 5.9 million tonnes represent a 14% increase over the previous quarter.
The increase in iron ore shipments were primarily from Phil's Creek with a quarterly increase of 27% to
1.28MT, continuing the ramp up and refocus of Pilbara oeprations. Operations at Poondano were
completed during the quarter with rehabilitiation work concluding in the area.

Spinifex Ridge, an operation acquired from Moly Mines in 2013 wil lcontinue at the rate of approximately
130,000 WMT per month until it is due to close in full year 2015. This material has provided good quality
incremental tonnes as the company transitioned from Poondano ore to Phil's Creek.
During the next two quarters MIN will bring Iron Valley nto production and subsequently wind down
operations at its other Pilbara operations, maximising efficiencies by operating from a single mine site in
the Pilbara. (Jul 17)

*STO: Jun qtr prod up 5%, sales rev up 22%/$A70m non cash impairment in int

Santos Ltd for the period ended June quarter announced production of 12.8Mmboe was up 5% on the
previous quarter and up 3% vs the second quarter of 2013.
Sales revenue was $974 million for the quarter and $1,887 for the first half, up 22% and 25%
respectively.

STO MD and CEO David Knox said the successful start up of the PNG LNG project, which shipped seven
LNG cargoes by the end of the quarter had driven sound second quarter results and built momentum for a
stronger second half.

Highlights for the quarter included the PNG LNG start up, ahead of schedule during the quarter,
completion of key construction milestones across the GLNG project, on track for first LNG in 2015. The
Barossa-2 appraisal well was successfully drilled and intersected 92m net gas pay. In early July first oil
was achieved from the Dua project in Vietnam.

Sales gas, ethane and gas to LNG production of 55.7 petajoules for the quarter was 8% higher than the
corresponding quarter with higher producton from Darwin LNG and start up at PNG LNG offset by lower
production from the Carnarvon Basin due to lower customer nominations.
Quarterly crude ol production of 2.1 million barrels was 16% lower than the previous quarter, due to
outages at Fletcher Finucane and Chim Sao, partly offset by higher Cooper Baisn production. The average
oil price fort he quarter was $122 per barrel, 5% lower than the previous corresponding period.

2014 guidance

Page56of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Santos will release its results for the half year ended June 30 on August 22. The half year report and
associated investor presentation will be available on Santos' website.
Santos expects to recognise an impairment charge of approximately $70 million, pre and post tax, in its
2014 half yera accounts associated with the company's Indonesian coal seam gas assets. The
impairment is non cash in nature and reflects Santos' decision to withdraw from South Sumatra CSG.

*ZIM: Major u/g collapse affects 50% Bimha mine/no injuries/equip damage
Zimplats Ltd advised a major underground collapse occurred at one of its mines at the Ngezi site 150 km

Mine, the largest of Zimplats' four mines. As a result of the proactive response from the management team
and the timely evacuation of all personnel, no injuries or damage of mobile equipment were reported.

*PBT: Positive response over time from Alzheimer's Phase 2 IMAGINE

Prana Biotechnology Ltd announced Prof Colin Masters, the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental
Health, University of Melbourne will include data from Prana's Phase 2 IMAGINE and EURO trials in his
presentation at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen Denmark (last night,
our time).

The presentation is entitled, "How to change and monitor the rates of A6 amyloid accumulation and
cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease".

The IMAGINE trial top line draft results were released on March 31. Further sub analyses of the top line
imaging data have been performed, including PiB-PET, MRI and FDG analysis of the effects of a once
daily, 250 mg dose of PBT2 over 12 months. IMAGINE enrolled 42 patients, 27 in the PBT2 group and 15
in placebo. In contrast to published literature, the average amyloid burden in the placebo group fell during
the trial. Prana conducted a sub analysis to better understand the behaviour of the placebo group.

Prof Masters on further investigation found the subgroup of PBT2 treated patients with a baseline of SUVR
above 2.5 had a significant decrease in amyooid burden that was not observed in participants on placebo
nor PBT2 participants with a SUVR less than 2.5.

Separately Prana confirmed the top line finding that there is a very promising trend towards the
preservation of brain volume (as measured by MRI) in PBT2 treated patients compared to placebo. (Jul
