ANZ COMMODITIES...

(Nov19): Bulks remain weak with iron ore finishing at $71.80, down 4.4%.
The decline in new home prices further supports concerns of a cooling property sector in China.

In an oversupplied market, signs of slowing construction activity reflect weaker demand for iron ore, a
key raw material in steel making.
China rebar near month (Dec 14) fell 0.5% but falls for 2015 contracts were much larger.

Base metals were lower, with copper suffering the largest losses at 1.1%.
The fall in Chinese house prices in October support an overall economic slowdown in key emerging
markets.

Japan slipping into recession is also weighing on base metal prices and sentiment with little upside
potential in the short-term.

Aluminium fell 0.7% and nickel 0.9%.

Precious metals were marginally higher, with gold gaining 0.8%.

prices and sanctions pushing the ruble to record lows.

Silver gained 0.1%, palladium 0.8% and platinum rose 0.3%.

Crude oil prices declined, with Brent trading at $78.64 and WTI at $74.64 as investors remain sceptical
of OPEC to collectively agree on output cuts in next week s meeting.

Large cuts are unlikely as it is seen to bolster the growth of US shale oil.

US shale continues to reach record production on the back of improved productivity of existing rigs.

Agriculture markets finished lower, with soybeans falling 1.2% amid signs of ample supply as a record
harvest advances to near completion in the US.

Wheat fell 0.9%.
In dairy overnight, Fonterra s GlobalDairyTrade auction results saw milk powder prices fall 5-6%, with
weakness evident across all contract periods.

Russian grip on gas supply looms over Europe's winter: Europeans who want to get tough with Russia
over the standoff in Ukraine must face a chilling fact: They need Russian natural gas to stay warm in the
winter.

About a third of Europe s gas comes from Russia and memories of shutoffs in 2006 and 2009 are a
haunting reminder of the grip it holds on the region s energy supply.

Ukraine is central to the problem, as the country s Soviet-era pipeline network carries about half of
Russia s gas exports to Europe.

world s top producer.
