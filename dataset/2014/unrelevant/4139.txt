SYDNEY -- China National Nuclear Corp. agreed to buy a large stake in one of Africa's biggest
uranium mines, giving the state-owned power generator better access to cleaner-burning energy.
A unit of CNNC agreed to buy 25% of the Langer Heinrich operation in Namibia from Paladin Energy
Ltd., the Australian uranium producer said Monday.

CNNC is one of China's largest generators of nuclear energy and has been rapidly expanding its
number of reactors as the world's No. 2 economy tries to reduce reliance on coal for its ballooning
energy needs.
The US$190 million deal allows CNNC to buy a quarter of the Namibian mine's output at the
prevailing spot-market price -- which can be cheaper than negotiated long-term contracts -- with the
option to buy more at normal market rates.

Paladin still will own the remaining 75% of Langer Heinrich.
China's leaders have stepped up efforts to introduce cleaner energy while penalizing polluters more
harshly after the heavy smog hit Beijing and other cities last year. Up to 80% of China's energy is
produced by burning coal.
China's tougher stand on pollution underscores concerns that environmental problems represent a
growing threat to economic prosperity and social stability -- and a deviation from a growth-at-all-costs
philosophy that had been followed for years.
China has the largest pipeline of new nuclear power plants in the world. There are 20 reactors in
operation on the mainland and another 28 under construction, according to the World Nuclear
Association, an industry body.
"China has ambitious nuclear-electrification programs extending for decades into the future," Paladin
said.
CNNC's director-in-general of the department of geology and mining, Du Yunbin, in a written
statement described the deal as mutually beneficial. CNNC couldn't be reached for further comment.

The agreement gives Paladin, which is based in Perth, Western Australia, much-needed cash. A sharp
decline in uranium prices since the Japanese nuclear-power crisis in early 2011 has contributed to
losses at the company.
Paladin in October said it was looking to sell a stake in Langer Heinrich to help repay debt, including a
US$300 million convertible bond due in 2015. The announcement came after Paladin reported a
US$420.9 million loss for the year through June, which widened from a loss of US$172.8 million the
previous year.
The world market for uranium hasn't yet recovered from the earthquake and tsunami that devastated
Japan's Fukushima Daiichi power plant, bringing the country's large nuclear industry to a halt. The

nuclear power. In the U.S., some utilities have abandoned plans for new plants.

The spot price is US$35 a pound, near an eight-year low and around 50% below where it stood before
the disaster. Still, Paladin Chief Executive John Borshoff told reporters that he saw China, the Middle
East, Russia and India as a growth engine for nuclear power in coming years.
"The big positive is that the Chinese have returned to the uranium market to complete a new deal
after a hiatus of two years," said Simon Tonkin, a Perth-based analyst at Australian stockbroker
Patersons. The last uranium deal for China was when China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co.,
as it was then called, bought Australia's Extract Resources Ltd. in 2012. The Paladin deal "could flow
through to the uranium price in the short term," Mr. Tonkin said.

The Langer Heinrich mine, with an anticipated two-decade life span, has been expanded twice since it
began producing in 2007. It is capable of producing 5.2 million pounds of uranium concentrate a
year. Paladin has said productivity improvements this year could help bring the level up to 5.7 million
pounds.
Paladin said the deal with China Uranium Corp. is expected to gain approval from Chinese regulators
by midyear.
