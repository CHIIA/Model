Australian shares have posted double-digit returns for the second financial year in a row, up 12.35 per
cent over the 12 months to June 30, 2014, fuelled by record low interest rates.

At Monday's close the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was trading at 5395.7 points, while the broader
All Ordinaries Index sat at 5382 points, with the biggest banks and miners higher over the 12-month
period.

But it was a lacklustre end to the fiscal period. The market lost 0.9 per cent in quiet trade on Monday,
to finish the month of June down 1.8 per cent.

New listings included iSentia Group, Gentrack Group, Asaleo Care and Monash IVF Group.

"While there was a rush of IPOs [initial public offerings] coming to market in June, most of the buying
was funded by institutions selling down existing holdings. So the benefit to the overall value of the
index was limited," Arnhem Investment Management head trader Simon Twiss said.
"A fall in the iron ore price to a 23-month low pulled the biggest miners down, with a big negative
impact on the overall performance of the ASX 200 over the past month," he added.

A decline in the value of resources giant BHP Billiton was the biggest drag on the index over June, as
the miner lost 3 per cent to $35.90 amid a weak outlook for coal and iron ore prices. Main rival Rio
Tinto edged up 0.01 per cent to $59.31, while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group lost 1.4 per cent
to $4.35.
The spot price for iron ore, delivered in China, sunk to $US89 per tonne in June, before ending the
month higher at $US94.90 a tonne. Iron ore is trading 30 per cent lower since January 1.

The big four banks declined over the month. Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 0.9 per cent to
$80.88, while Westpac Banking Corp fell 1.6 per cent to $33.88. National Australia Bank shed 2.1 per
cent to $32.78, and ANZ Banking Group fell 0.5 per cent to $33.34.

Telstra Corp was another heavy weight on the bourse, losing 2.4 per cent to $5.21, despite getting a
boost after unveiling a new $150 million deal with NBN Co last week.Retailers tumble

In the wake of May's tough federal budget announcement, June was plagued by downgrades from the
retail sector. Kathmandu Holdings and Super Retail Group were among the retailers to tumble after
lowering their full-year profit guidance.

Food and liquor was the worst-performing sector for the month, down 4.6 per cent, as the biggest
supermarkets struggled amid weak consumer spending. Woolworths lost 6.2 per cent to $35.22, while
Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, shed 3.5 per cent to $41.84.

dollar lifted above US94¢.

Utilities was the best-performing sector, falling a modest 0.2 per cent, as investor sentiment turned
defensive. Electricity and gas retailer AGL Energy added 0.5 per cent to $15.48.
Despite global oil prices climbing in response to an insurgent uprising in Iraq and Syria, most
Australian energy producers were pushed lower over June. Australia's biggest oil producer,
Woodside Petroleum, fell 2.6 per cent to $41.07, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil lifted
2.4 per cent to $US105.21 a barrel.
Oil Search was the standout performer in the energy sector, up 2.6 per cent to $9.67, having lifted its
annual guidance after starting production at a major Papua New Guinea gas project.

Karoon Gas Australia was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 24.8 per cent to $3.07,
as the company finalises an $800 million asset sale to Origin Energy.
Paladin Energy was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200, dumping 24.4 per cent to 29.5¢, hurt
by ongoing weakness in the uranium price since the Fukushima disaster.

After struggling to gain shareholder approval, Frank Lowy's newly structured Westfield empire was
warmly received. Scentre Group, the new entity for Westfield's shopping malls in Australia and New
Zealand, rose 3.9 per cent to end the month at $3.20, while the international business Westfield Corp
lifted 1.4 per cent to $7.15.

Household appliance maker GUD Holdings, owner of the Sunbeam label, added 17.1 per cent to
$6.22 after pledging to raise prices to offset falling profits. Travel insurance provider Cover-More
Group lost 19.8 per cent to $1.89 as sentiment toward the stock was hurt by a decline in consumer
confidence.
