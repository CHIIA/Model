Cooper Energy ( ASX:COE ) and its partners have spudded the Jenners-1 exploration well in the
Cooper Basin South Australia.

The Jenners prospect is located 5.2 kilometres northwest of the Keleary field which has produced
more than 1.6 million barrels of oil from the Poolowanna Formation with additional oil production
from the Tinchoo Birkhead and Hutton Formations.

It is a four-way dip closed anticline defined by the 2013 Dundinna 3D seismic survey.

Jenners-1 is located 2.3 kilometres north of Fairbridge-1 which was drilled in December
2005-January 2006 based on 2D seismic data and had oil shows in the Birkhead and Poolowanna
Formations but is now interpreted to have been drilled outside of structural closure.

Bagheera East-1 drilled recently in PEL 514 approximately 4.3 kilometres northeast of Jenners-1
also had oil shows at multiple levels.
Cooper has a 19.165% interest in PEL100. Operator Senex Energy ( ASX:SXY ) has a 55% stake
while Santos ( ASX:STO ) holds 25.835%.
The company recorded a statutory profit after tax of $22 million for the 12 months to 30 June 2014
due to record oil production of 594000 barrels.
It is well funded with over $75 million in cash and financial assets.
