*The Nikkei Dow futures is up 30 points to 14,250 points, Shanghai CSI physical is u p5.54 points to
2009.88. Hang Seng futures is down 5 points to 21,500 points. S&P futuers is down 0.5 points to 1832.40,

Spot gold is down $2 to $1380. Crude is up 22c to $99.11.

"Risk off" rules so far, with safe sector stocks in favor - reaction by various authorities to the overwhelming
vote in Crimea to return to Russia is awaited. The market is also grappling with "new look" economic goals
in China and their implementation.

"Support is at 5320, then 5295. I will call the market down 25 points'.

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "For the S&P500, the long term uptrend that commenced
back in May 2012 is still in tact and won't be tested until probably about 1785, if you take it from May 2011.

"On Friday there was a break in the 20 day moving average, which is short term bearish. The RSI is also
showing weakness. Support will come into play at about 1,830. A break of 1830 will probably see 1815
tested.

"The short term outlook on the S&P is negative, based on breaks of the 20 day moving average. There is
still support around the 1830 level. It will be interesting to see if it holds.
"Copper is trading at $295/lb, a huge breakdown from the $3.10.3.05/lb level. Good support over the year
is broken. There is some pretty good support if you go back in the weekly chart, at $2.95/2.90. I would
expect it to hold these levels. All the technical levels are heavily oversold. We may see a short term
bounce, likely to be a bit of a dead cat bounce to $3.05/lb. It will be interesting to see where to from there.
"Spot gold has continued to gather momentum from the long term downtrend. In fact it closed at its
highest level since September last year. It is approaching the $1400 level where there will be significant
resistance in my view.

"All the technical indicators are suggesting it is heavily over bought. While it still looks good, short term
traders are likely to take profits between here and $1400/oz. There should be some resistance there.
Support for gold is around the $1375 level.

"We broke the 20 day moving average last week. Our losses on Friday were a bit more extended. There is
a double top and an inverse head and shoulders that has broken down.

"I can't see any good support until 5320 which is not that far away. We are probably set to test that level
and break through it today. The next level of support is 5205.

"The XJO is short term bearish with a double top and in fact an inverse head and shoulders break down.

"The RSI is in a deteriorating downtrend.

"For the day support is at 5320, then 5295. I will call the market down 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 83.2 points to 5329.4 last Friday.

8.5c per share to advance development test work and economic studies at its flagship graphite project in
northern Sweden.
The 20 million shares is within the company's current capacity under ASX rules.
Talga managing director Mark Thompson said in the report the strong support the company attracted for
the placement follows Talga's outstanding raw ore-to-graphene results from last month and worldwide
excitement in the graphite space following the Tesla Motor car company's announcement of its plans for a
Lithium ion battery gigafactory (announced on February 26). Lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles can
require up to 100 kg of graphite per unit and industry commentators have calculated that six new graphite
mines are required for the Tesla battery factory alone (Industrial Minerals 7 March 2014).
Graphene and graphite "graphene is to graphite what gold is to silver" - analyst

Last month, Talga announced exceptional results from graphene test work conducted by the University of
Adelaide on drillcore from the company's wholly owned Nunasvaara graphite deposit. Among the testwork
conclusions were that unoxidised graphene could be directly and rapidly liberated from unprocessed
Nunasvaara graphite ore in a one step process. The quality of the graphene produced was outstanding
and comparable to graphene made from synthetic routes.

The test work used a processing method well suited for upscaling to bulk production. Mr Thompson said
with the new funds and support the company will commence upscaling the Unasvaara test work to
measure both graphite and graphene yield and characteristics. The new process being tested liberates
both graphite and graphene with graphite being the major product by volume.
