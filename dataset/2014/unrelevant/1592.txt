International Healthway Corporation Ltd (IHC), an integrated healthcare services and facilities
provider, has signed another two Contracts of Sale for the acquisition of two freehold properties in
Australia, in the cities of Melbourne and Geelong, for an aggregate of A$63.8 million.

In a statement, IHC said the first property, acquired for about A$35.8 million, is an eight-storey
commercial building with net leasable area of 8,229 sq. m. at 541 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.
The second property, acquired for A$28.0 million, is a four-storey medical-use building with net
leasable area of 5,172 sq. m. at 73-79 Little Ryrie Street, Geelong.
These acquisitions come in swift succession to IHC'™s acquisition of a freehold commercial building
at 553 St Kilda Road, Melbourne for A$45.0 million announced earlier on March 10, 2014, which
marked IHC'™s entry into Australia.
In aggregate, the net leasable area for IHC'™s property assets in Australia will now amount to 23,571
sq. m.
Dr. Jong Hee Sen, executive chairman and Group president of IHC, said: "IHC is focused on
developing our presence across the markets where we have identified strong growth potential and
where we can leverage our existing capabilities, expertise, value creation capabilities and reputation.

"Given that Melbourne and Geelong are two of the most populous cities in the state of Victoria,
Australia, we are very pleased to acquire another two freehold properties at the attractive locations of
541 St Kilda Road and 73-79 Little Ryrie Street," he said.

Dr. Jong said these acquisitions will further entrench IHC's presence in Australia.
He said together with the Group's other Australian property at 553 St Kilda Road, IHC will be
well-poised to provide facilities and services that meet the healthcare needs of residents living in
Melbourne and Geelong through its three Australian assets.
'It also enhances our portfolio of medical real estate assets in Asia-Pacific. With our Australian
acquisitions, the Group'™s portfolio of properties has now risen to 18 assets located across Australia,
Japan, Malaysia and the People's Republic of China," he added.
