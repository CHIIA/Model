Stratum Metals, the Brisbane-based company developing its East Menzies gold project, is emerging
as another potential ore source for the hungry Paddington mill.
As Chinese-owned Norton Gold Fields seeks to reach its ambitious goal of doubling annual
production to 300,000 ounces by 2017, tiddlers such as one-time market darling Stratum could
become part of the picture. Norton, in which China’s biggest gold producer Zijin Mining Group holds
an 82 per cent stake, has already done deals with the likes of Kalgoorlie-based Phoenix Gold.

The Dianmin Chen-led Norton has also been in discussions about processing options with another
neighbour, Excelsior Gold, boasting almost 500,000oz of gold reserves.

Excelsior is already funded through to the definitive feasibility study phase and looms as another
potential target for Norton, which is in the process of a hostile takeover of Bullabulling Gold.
In Stratum’s case, the company is focusing on the Granny Venn and Auntie Nellie open-cut mines
near Menzies.
Ore from both mines was processed at Norton’s Paddington plant when they were last mined in the
early 2000s.
Stratum’s strategy is to aim for early gold production — possibly as soon as the March quarter next
year — via toll treatment.

Any cash flow would be directed towards exploration, where potential has been identified at the
Goodenough gold mine area and Four O’Clock gold target.

The area’s potential was highlighted last year during a shaft sampling program, identifying 444 old
mine shafts over 11km of strike, including 13 shaft spoil sample sites with average grades of 5g/t.

Stratum, which consolidated the historically prospective region in 2012-13, moved a step closer to the
development phase on Tuesday when it announced an entitlement offer to raise $3.03 million. It is
the bidding of the company’s new board, following a major changing of the guard.

Since October, directors Kent Hunter, Ralph Stagg and Michael Addison have all resigned.

Managing director Martin Holland quit his post in February, but remains non-executive director.

Filling the void has been John Shepherd as a non-executive director, while Duncan Cornish is chief
financial officer.

Stratum shares last changed hands for 1.3 cents.
