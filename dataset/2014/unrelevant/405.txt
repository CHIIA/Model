TORONTO, June 16, 2014
TORONTO, June 16, 2014 /CNW/ - Alacer Gold Corp. ("Alacer" or the "Company") [TSX: ASR and ASX:
AQG] is pleased to announce the positive results of the Definitive Feasibility Study ("DFS") for the
processing of sulfide ore through whole ore pressure oxidation ("POX") at its Çöpler Gold Mine in
Erzincan Province, Turkey. The Company has completed extensive technical, design, engineering and
procurement studies in preparing the DFS and will be carrying out basic engineering and further
optimization studies, as well as completing the permitting process, in advance of a construction decision
anticipated in the first quarter of 2015.

The results of the DFS incorporate the outcomes of the Resource Reconciliation Study to date and
resulted in new Çöpler Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves estimates. See the separate
announcement issued today titled "Alacer Gold Announces Results of Ongoing Resource Reconciliation
Study for the Çöpler Gold Mine" for further information.

Together, the results of the DFS and the Mineral Resources and Reserves update represent a material
step forward for the Company. They demonstrate the viability of processing sulfide ore at the mine,
thereby extending the mine life while generating attractive and robust financial returns.
These outcomes show that the Company is on track to deliver the action plan laid out in September 2013
and is well on its way to the longer-term strategy of becoming a multi-mine producer in Turkey.

Rod Antal, Alacer's Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The results of this DFS are an important and positive
milestone for Alacer that not only reconfirms the world-class nature of the Çöpler Mine but provides a
definitive pathway for Çöpler, and positive cash flow for Alacer for the next 20 years. Taking the time to get
the DFS right has provided us the opportunity to significantly derisk the various technical aspects of the
study and has produced a robust economic result.

"The DFS has proven the viability of the sulfide project and with our current cash position and Class 3 Cost
Estimate(4) complete, we could start construction tomorrow without the need for any additional funding.
However, our work is not done. As the project moves into basic engineering, we will continue to pursue
ways to derisk and optimize the project for Alacer. The focus will be on all areas of the project, including

Page167of238©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.the various financial aspects of the project, capital cost controls, strengthening the execution team, and
operating cost management, while continuing to look at additional ways to value engineer the project.
"The critical path requires us to secure all of the permits and land acquisition required to move into
construction. This process started in earnest with the submission of the supplemental Environmental
Impact Assessment in April. We anticipate receiving all required permits in the first quarter of 2015, with
construction commencing in the second quarter of 2015. We believe the sulfide project provides the best
growth opportunity for Alacer and solidifies our strategy of focusing our efforts and expertise on Turkey."

Additionally, the DFS estimates: (i) sustaining capital expenditure for the sulfide project totals $106 million
over 17 years; (ii) remaining sustaining capital expenditure for the heap leach operation totals $23 million;
and (iii) reclamation costs total $56 million.

Alacer intends to pursue a project delivery method which utilizes an engineering, procurement and
construction ("EPC") approach. This approach will involve including the construction contractors in the
basic engineering phase in order to establish a well-defined project scope of work, project execution plan
and control documents. Alacer will select contractors to participate in the process based on quality,
experience, safety records, financial strength and other factors, and will seek fixed price proposals for the
plant near the end of basic engineering.
Long-lead time and critical equipment items include the oxygen plant (28 months), autoclaves and
agitators (15 months) and SAG and ball mills (14 months). Construction on site is planned to commence in
Q2 2015 and lead to commissioning of the POX plant towards the end of 2017.

Mining

The Çöpler deposit will continue to be mined by a contractor using conventional truck and shovel methods.
Three open pits are currently being mined for oxide ore, which will ultimately converge into a single open
pit over the life of the sulfide project. The mine design for the sulfide project was based on an optimized pit
shell using a gold price of US$800 per ounce.
During the pre-production phase of the sulfide project, sulfide ore mined is being stockpiled while oxide
ore mined is placed on the heap leach pad. At March 31, 2014, sulfide ore totaling 2.0 million tonnes at
4.9g/t gold had been stockpiled. Prior to the planned commissioning of the POX plant in 2017, the sulfide
ore stockpile is estimated to increase to approximately 9.0 million tonnes at 3.0g/t gold.
Life-of-mine strip ratio (waste to ore) is estimated to average 3.1 from July 2014. The total mining rate per
annum will continue at current rates of roughly 33 million tonnes per annum ("Mtpa") until 2018 when the
rate is halved to roughly 17Mtpa. The mining rate is then planned to reduce further in 2020, averaging
roughly 11Mtpa from 2020 until mining ceases at the beginning of 2026. Processing of stockpiled sulfide
ore is planned to continue until 2034.

Processing
The planned throughput of the POX plant is based on a nominal 5,000 tonnes per day (1.8Mtpa). Gold
recoveries are expected to average 94% from sulfide ore.
The ore is first crushed and milled to a slurry with water in a conventional grinding circuit. That slurry is
then pumped into the acidulation circuit where it is treated with acid to reduce the carbonate levels in the
ore.

From there, the slurry is pumped to the autoclave circuit, comprised of seven individual pressure vessels,
where the contained sulfide minerals react with oxygen gas at high temperature and pressure to convert
gold and copper into recoverable forms. The hot slurry from the last pot is discharged through two flash
vessels in which the temperature and pressure of the oxidized slurry is reduced. Steam from this process
is used to preheat the autoclave circuit feed slurry, making the POX process autogenous, with all energy
required to maintain the process in normal operation derived from oxidation of the sulfide sulfur contained
in the Çöpler ore.
The gold-bearing solids are then processed in a conventional cyanide leach and Carbon-in-Pulp ("CIP")
gold recovery circuit.

Following the CIP circuit, the cyanide in the tailings slurry is destroyed in the cyanide detoxification circuit.
The tailings are then pumped to the lined Tailings Storage Facility located roughly 1.5 km east of the
processing plant.
Copper bearing liquid is then treated with a reagent to recover the copper as a high grade synthetic
sulfide concentrate, which is shipped to a copper smelter for further processing.

Heap leach processing continues at current rates of stacking during the sulfide project pre-production
phase until the end of 2017. Ore is crushed and agglomerated before being placed on the heap leach pad
where gold is leached into solution and collected for processing in an ADR circuit. Gold is poured as dore
bars for shipment to a third-party precious metals refinery. Heap leach gold production will continue in
2018 and 2019 at reduced rates, stemming from intermittent stacking of the highest grade heap leach ores

Page171of238©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.coming out of the pits until ultimate capacity of the heap leach pad is reached as well as residual ounces
collected from the heap leach. Gold recoveries from the heap leaching of oxide ores are expected to
average 70%.

Permitting

The permitting process for the sulfide processing facility has already begun, with the submission of the
supplemental Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") in early April 2014. The EIA approval process
involves the filing of an initial application defining the scope of the proposed project, a public consultation
process, and a final submission. Upon receipt of approval, the Company will then proceed to apply for
forestry, operating, construction and other required permits.
It is important to note that the Company was previously successful in gaining permits for the Çöpler
oxides. This permitting experience has been further enhanced with the excellent operating, safety,
environmental and community engagement record at Çöpler since 2010.
The Company expects to obtain the supplemental EIA approval in late 2014 and all required land use
permits in Q1 of 2015, allowing construction to begin in Q2 of 2015. Stakeholder engagement has begun
with the community consultation process and will continue through project development and operations.

Next Phase

The next stage of the project will be to further reduce risk by completing the basic engineering phase.
During this stage a number of work streams will be progressed including:

-- Completion of basic engineering;
-- Metallurgical testing for operational readiness;
-- Remaining land

acquisition; and

-- Recruiting for key project execution and operational positions.

The basic engineering phase will provide the control estimate and the project execution plan for the sulfide
project.

Although the DFS is based on a conventional EPC approach, as noted above, a fixed-price EPC approach
will be pursued during this next stage.
