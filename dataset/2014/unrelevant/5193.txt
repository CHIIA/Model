THE sharemarket posted solid gains as investors were buoyed by China's best manufacturing activity
data in six months.

The June reading of HSBC's manufacturing activity index rose to its highest reading for 2014, at 50.8,
which the bank said showed the world's second largest economy had turned the corner.

Mining stocks led the gains on the sharemarket, as they were also boosted by a higher iron ore price,
CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said.

"It was a good day for Australian investors, with a nice bounce back in the market and a bit of volatility
returning," he said.

Rio Tinto added $1.49, or 2.6 per cent, to $60, BHP rose 50¢ to $36.45 and Fortescue Metals gained
17¢, or 4 per cent, to $4.39.

The next best performing sector was consumer-related companies, which have recently been hit by a
slump in consumer sentiment.

Woolworths climbed 27¢ to $35.67 and Wesfarmers lifted 31¢ to $41.56.

Grocery wholesaler Metcash was also higher, up 8¢ at $2.85, despite the IGA supermarket brand
owner's annual profit dropping 18 per cent.
Ten also rose, although it fell back from earlier gains, on speculation a private equity firm is looking at
a takeover.

Ten shares gained 0.5¢ to 25¢.

Among the banks, Commonwealth Bank added 37¢ to $81.79, National Australia Bank gained 21¢ to
$33.34, Westpac lifted 22¢ to $34.37 and ANZ was flat at $33.98.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index added 33.8 points, or 0.62 per cent, to 5453.3.

The broader All Ordinaries index gained 31.1 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 5432.7.

The September share price index futures contract was 29 points higher at 5409, with 23,750 contracts
traded.
The price of gold was $US1316.80 per fine ounce, up $US5.10 on Friday's price of $US1311.70.
National turnover was 2.03 billion securities worth $4.3 billion. AAP
