Sydney watering hole the Tea Gardens Hotel in Bondi Junction has become the highest-selling pub
asset in 2014, netting more than $37 million in a sale to a private investor.
The pub, owned by Melbourne-based publicans Aussie Leisure Group sold on Friday at the end of
a campaign which attracted interest from Singaporean residential developers, Chinese gaming
groups and local hoteliers including the Laundy Group and Merivale.

The sale, brokered by Ray White agent Andrew Jolliffe, represents the latest in a long line of pubs to
change hands in Sydney's quickening market for pubs and bars.
The hotel had 30 gaming machines on its 800-square-metre-site.
The Aussie Leisure Group bought the hotel in 2006 for $44.75 million.
The group owned by businessmen Mazen Tabet, John Ashley and Proko Athanasakos is in the
midst of consolidating its portfolio of properties along the Eastern seaboard.
The group in 2013 sold the Iron Horse in Newcastle for about $10 million, in addition to the Winham
Point Tavern in Queensland, which netted just under $10 million.
The group's Meadowbrook Hotel in the south of Brisbane is on the market with expectations of
more than $15 million and its Cambridge Tavern in Fairfield in Sydney's west came on the market
two weeks ago with a price tag of more than $45 million.
Elsewhere in Sydney, The Bellevue Hotel and the Paddington Arms were both sold earlier this year,
while parties are locked in negotiations to secure ownership of The Winery in Surry Hills.

The fashionable Winery complex on Crown Street which includes Keystone's restaurant and bar,
The Winery, and a cafe called Pino's, was passed in at auction last week for about $9 million. CBRE
agent Gavin Lloyd says a deal on the 1067-square-metre-site with a net income of $550,000 a year,
could be hatched this week.
Other pubs to change hands include The Bat and Ball hotel on Cleveland Street in Surry Hills, which
also sold last week to a passive Chinese investor for $4.5 million.
