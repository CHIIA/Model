CHINESE technology products company Lenovo has struck a deal to place an app developed by
Gold Coast-based free music-streaming company Guvera on its next generation of smartphones.
The deal comes on the back of support for Guvera by Australia’s AMMA Private Equity which has
invested $45 million to fund development of the business and is a major shareholder in the
company.

AMMA chief executive Paul Jansz unveiled the deal yesterday and said the Guvera app would be
included “on the glass” of Lenovo’s new S-Series smartphones.
He said the tie-up was a huge windfall for the company along the lines of the relationship between
iTunes and Apple.

At the recent 2014 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Lenovo said the new smartphone
with app would be rolled out to 30 countries including the massive Indian market from April.

Mr Jansz said Guvera’s success would not have been possible without AMMA’s long-term
support.“Guvera’s partnership with Lenovo, a US$34 billion personal technology giant, is an
outstanding success story for a local company and vindicates AMMA’s strategic decision to fund the
growth and development of the business.’’
