SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Australian shares recovered 0.7 percent on Tuesday,
underpinned by a recovery in the resources sector as iron ore, copper and other base metals clawed
higher, though a dip in a business survey kept some investors wary.

The resource sector rallied 2.2 percent as it posted a recovery after being routed since early
September by a slump in iron ore prices.
Iron ore for immediate delivery to China <.IO62-CNI=SI> rose 4 percent to $83.10 a tonne.

BHP Billiton Ltd climbed 2.4 percent, Rio Tinto Ltd jumped 3.1 percent, while OZ Minerals Ltd soared
8.5 percent after saying production from its major Prominent Hill mine was strong and on track to meet
full-year guidance.

"It's a bit of short-covering and it's buying from very low levels," said Peter Esho, a managing partner at
100 Doors, a wealth management firm in Sydney.
"I don't think commodities have completely turned, I think it's the iron ore stocks coming off from
ridiculously low levels."

The S&P/ASX 200 index gained 35.9 points to 5,191.4 by 0110 GMT. The benchmark has been on a
downward trajectory since September, as a rout in iron ore prices, a rise in bond yields and concerns
over slowing growth in China, Australia's largest export market, has kept investors away from local
equities.

Top 20 stocks on the ASX 200 also rose, with defensives Wesfarmers Ltd and Cochlear Ltd adding 1.9
percent and 0.3 percent each. Among financials, Westpac Banking Corp rose 0.7 percent, while
National Australia Bank edged 0.6 percent higher

Elsewhere, a measure of Australian business conditions eased in September to its lowest in four
months.

"Growth concerns continue to rattle global investors," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at
CMC Markets in a note.

U.S. stocks dropped more than 1 percent overnight, with the S&P 500 closing below a key technical
support level, as declines in energy and airline shares led a late-day selloff.

at A$117 million.

Caltex Australia Ltd added 1.1 percent after announcing its Kurnell Terminal in Sydney has started
operation.
Shares in Australian online travel firmWotif.com Holdings Ltd fell more than 7 percent to three-week
lows of A$3.05 after the New Zealand Commerce Commission said it has briefly delayed its regulatory
ruling on Expedia Inc's acquisition of the company.

New Zealand's benchmark NZX50 index slipped 45.24 points or 0.8 percent to hit an eight-week low
around 5,124.81, taking losses into a third session on the back of an ongoing sell-off in Xero.

The accounting software developer slumped 3 percent to a 13-month low of NZ$16.75 ($13.17) as
investors become more concerned about its global expansion plans as competition heats up in
overseas markets including the United States.
Refining New Zealand fell 2.7 percent to NZ$1.67 as profit-taking knocked the country's only oil refiner
from a three-month high of NZ$1.73 hit on Monday.

Building materials manufacturer Fletcher Building slipped 1.9 percent to NZ$8.48, its lowest since the
start of the year on worries that its overseas sales could be hit by ongoing concerns about the global
growth outlook. (Editing by Eric Meijer)
