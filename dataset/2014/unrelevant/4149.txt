DAIRYGiant Fonterra has announced a $573 million partnership with Chinese infant food manufacturer
Beingmate.
The move will see the Chinese company owning a 51 per cent stake in Fonterra’s Darnum plant west of
Melbourne, and Fonterra buying a 20 per cent share in Beingmate.

Fonterra Australia managing director Judith Swales said that if approved by regulatory authorities in both
countries, the move would be a “game changer” for the Australian dairy industry, and for Fonterra’s
relationship with its most important market, China.

“We’ve always talked about, and a lot of companies talk about, this increasing demand for infant formula
in China,” Ms Swales said.
“This gives us an opportunity to connect all the way through from Australian milk pools, all the way
through to Chinese producers, in one supply chain.”
Ms Swales said the process would likely take 6 to 8 months and give the company access to around
80,000 points of sale in China through Beingmate, which currently holds around 10 per cent of the
Chinese infant formula market.
As part of the deal, the product would be distributed exclusively through Fonterra’s Anmum brand.
China’s infant formula market is currently worth $18 billion and predicted to reach $33 billion by 2017,
according to independent analysis Euromonitor.

Ms Swales said the Darnum facility, which currently produces 50,000 tonnes of infant formula a year,
could potentially double its output.
She said 100 per cent of the milk processed at Darnum would be sourced from Australia.
“One of the great things about where the factory is located is that it’s a great source of great milk,” Ms
Swales said.
“I think there is potential for more milk to be produced down there, just as there is in other parts of
Australia.
“We hope this would give farmers confidence to invest and grow their milk.”

The Darnum facility currently employs 160 people.

Ms Swales said Fonterra hoped to expand the workforce as volumes increased.
