Sydney - Tuesday - March 11 (RWE) - Dart Energy Limited (ASX: DTE) has today released its interim
results for the financial period to 31 December 2013.

Commercial highlights for the period included:

** Entry into a farm-out agreement with GDF-Suez, and in January 2014 entry into a second farm- out
agreement with Total.

Collectively these farm-outs relate to fifteen licences in the Bowland Basin, England, UK.
Under these farm-outs, up to approximately $90.75 million (US$82.5 million) of future project
expenditure will be carried by the farm-in partners.

** Agreement with UK regulatory authorities for the extension of the terms of relevant UK licences, to
allow for completion of farm-out work programmes, and agreement on relinquishment of seven existing
licences which are considered to be of low prospectivity, thus completing the rationalisation of the UK
portfolio.
** An appeal to the Scottish Government for a determination of the company's PEDL 133 planning
permission application, with a decision expected before the end of 2014.
** Sale of certain assets, most notably the company's interest in the Liulin CSG project in China.

Financial highlights for the period included: .
** A successful capital raising on the ASX of approximately $20.7 million in aggregate.

respect of the farm- outs to GDF-Suez and Total.

Limited and part area of a UK licence).
