0130 GMT [Dow Jones] The National Australia Bank's Commercial Property Index falls to -6 points from
-3 points in the second quarter from the first quarter. Sentiment is weaker in all markets except
city-located hotels, the survey shows. Sentiment is negative in all states, especially in Western Australia,
and to a lesser extent Victoria, NAB says. Capital values are lower in all property sectors, with rents
falling fast. Property firms are now most concerned about stock availability, especially in Victoria, but
concerns over government red tape, regulation, bureaucracy and consumer confidence are also rising.

0127 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar has slipped below US$0.9400 after U.S. consumer
confidence rose in July from June, surpassing analysts' expectations, says Stephen Innes, Senior Trader
at OANDA. AUD/USD is now 0.9384. "The Aussie is trading lower on the back of continued positive
greenback sentiment," Innes said. "Certainly some U.S. dollar strength can be attributed to month-end
flows, but the general feeling on the street is that the U.S. dollar shorts are unwilling to stand in front of
these risk events," he said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
0121 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities will seek to extend a six-day rally today, with support from
Chinese policy easing calming investor nerves ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve's July meeting
and the release of US GDP data for the second quarter. The Hang Seng Index rose 0.9% to 24,640.53
yesterday, and index futures for July delivery, due to expire today, rise 0.3% ahead of the market open.
Standard Chartered sees "growing evidence that Beijing is easing credit conditions," citing a new pledged
supplementary lending facility. Though there's little by way of data on the docket for China today, Societe
Generale says that the Federal Open Market Committee will be closely watched, even if it brings few
surprises. "Today's FOMC statement is likely to be a near-verbatim repeat of the June communique, with
the exception of adjusting asset purchases for another $10bn taper." (gregor.hunter@wsj.com; Twitter:

0119 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/SGD pair hits a seven-day high of 1.2428 in the London/New York
session on Tuesday as the greenback rises broadly on a surprise gain in the Conference Board U.S.
consumer confidence index to a near seven-year high of 90.9 in July. The currency pair has breached the
downtrend resistance line that runs from the June 4 high of 1.2587, coming in now at 1.2415. Dow Jones
technical analysis shows the USD/SGD short-term technical outlook is positive as the rate-of-change
momentum indicator is advancing inside positive territory; the daily Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence and slow stochastic indicators are bullish; the five-day moving average has
risen above the 15-day moving average. Spot USD/SGD in the near term may target 1.2446 (July 16
reaction high), and then the 55-day moving average (now at 1.2477 and near the weekly tenkan line on
the USD/SGD Ichikumo chart). Spot USD/SGD is last quoted at 1.2422-27 in the interbank market,
compared with 1.2423-25 in late New York trade Tuesday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
0118 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares of Nomura Holdings (8604.TO) are down 2.0% at Y652.7 after the firm
reported Tuesday a 70% net profit drop in the April-June quarter from a year earlier. The brokerage
benefited last year from investors purchasing Japanese stocks amid high expectation of an economic

Page30of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.recovery. This year, the boom seems to be cooling. "There are few market participants," Mitsushige
Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. "Some market gains are led largely by
some buying in futures markets." Shares of Daiwa Securities Group (8601.TO) are up 0.8% at Y867.5,
after the brokerage reported a 40% fall in net profit in the quarter. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com)
0119 GMT [Dow Jones] Due to potential credit loosening in China, Credit Suisse is upgrading its rating
on the country's property sector to neutral in contrast to its bearish stance since October 2013. But the
move is not without caveats. The loosening of monetary policies helped end the housing market
downturns in early 2009 and mid-2012. But Credit Suisse says credit loosening won't be as dramatic this
time. Also there is an oversupply of homes and most people now have alternative investment channels,
such as wealth management products, apart from housing. "We maintain our concerns on the sector's
structural problems, as well as uncertainties over how much help the potential credit loosening can
provide to the housing market this time," says Credit Suisse analysts Jinsong Du and Kelvin
Tam.(esther.fung@wsj.com, Twitter: @estherfung)

0113 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is up 0.2% at 15652.64 as Japanese earnings results are largely
favorable and the JPY trends weaker, says Tomohiro Okawa, equity strategist at UBS Securities Japan.
The USD/JPY is now above 102 and around levels not seen in three weeks following improving U.S.
consumer confidence data. "A gradual upward trend [in Japanese stocks] is likely to continue," he says.
"Valuations on Japanese stocks are still relatively cheap. Global asset allocation flows tend to come in.
European economies aren't great. The U.S. market is too strong. Because the Chinese economy is
steady, neighboring (Asian) markets are faring okay, benefiting Japan." Honda Motor (7267.TO) shares
are up 3.2% at Y3,659.5 after the company lifted its full-year sales and profit forecasts. Skymark Airlines
(9204.TO) shares down 12% at Y221 amid uncertainly over the cost related to cancelling Airbus jet
orders.(kosaku.narioka@wsj.com)

0104 GMT [Dow Jones] Japanese companies appear to be shifting focus to India, according to the latest
figures from India's Dept. of Industrial Policy and Promotion. Japan's FDI into India in the first four
months of 2014 was 69 billion rupees ($1.1 billion), equivalent to almost 90% of all Japanese FDI into
India last year. Political tensions with China and ultra-low interest rates in their own country have
stimulated a shift of Japanese investment into faster-growing markets with younger consumers such as
Southeast Asia. With a median age of 27 and a new, investor-friendly government, India may be
beckoning to Japan Inc. (wayne.arnold@wsj.com)
0102 GMT [Dow Jones] A fall in Chinese aluminum production costs could pull the proverbial rug out
from under market prices. Commonwealth Bank of Australia says new large scale and cheap capacity in
Xinjiang "is likely to reduce average costs in China's aluminium sector, thereby reducing marginal cost
support for global aluminum prices, even as western world aluminium markets tighten." It says Xinjiang in
April accounted for 19% of total Chinese aluminum production, "consolidating the province's position as
China's largest aluminium producer." It expects the province to continue to take market share as a result
of lower power costs, as smelters take advantage of cheap local thermal coal. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com;

0052 GMT [Dow Jones] The overnight rise of the U.S. dollar index ought to result in a higher PBOC daily
USD/CNY parity rate, which could in turn push spot USD/CNY higher. Spot USD/CNY continues to show
a bearish technical bias unless it closes Wednesday above 6.1941 and thus negates the daily Bollinger
downtrend channel's influence. Spot USD/CNY's consecutive 5-day descent has now extended past the
confines of the lower Bollinger band (standard deviation 2) suggesting that its recent movement has
overshot the short-term average statistical fluctuation and could thus be due for a pullback. The U.S.
FOMC meeting later today could steer the U.S. dollar higher if the U.S. Federal Reserve hints at raising
interest rates sooner. Fresh U.S. sanctions announced overnight could also cast a mild risk aversion in
Asia and lead to U.S. dollar strength. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)
0047 GMT [Dow Jones] Moody's Investors Service says that a severe mining downturn in Australia
would trigger only a "relatively minor" increase in delinquencies for the Australian Residential Mortgage
Backed Securities. "Australian RMBS would prove resilient in the event of a mining downturn because
they are geographically diversified, limiting the exposure of individual transactions to regions that would
be severely affected," said Alena Chen, a Moody's analyst. Chen said Moody's conducted this analysis
because Australia's mining sector has seen significant job losses over the last two years, shedding close
to 11,000 employees. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

0034 GMT [Dow Jones] Moody's has retained it stable outlook on New Zealand's banking system
"reflecting our expectation of sustained economic growth and stable asset quality in the coming 12-18
months," the investor service says in a note. "While the banks could face mild pressure on their loan
margins as monetary policy gradually tightens, low credit costs will help preserve profits and allow the
banks to maintain their strong capital buffers." It says funding conditions will remain favorable. "Deposit
growth will continue to exceed loan growth, although we expect the gap to narrow. Consequently, the

Page31of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.banks will not have to increase the proportion of their funding from wholesale sources."
