MELBOURNE, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Tiger Resources Ltd has agreed to buy out the Democratic Republic
of Congo state miner's stake in the Kipoi copper mine for $111 million, taking full control of the mine,
the Australian company said on Thursday.

The agreement was sealed just a month after state-owned miner Gecamine's chief executive was
sacked after the company came under fire for selling assets cheaply and without the government's
approval.

The deal with Tiger is subject to no objections from the DRC government.
"The purchase price is considered a good outcome for all parties," Tiger Managing Director Brad
Marwood said in a statement, pointing to the fact that the operation's existing separation plant is nearing
the end of its life.
Kipoi is currently producing 25,000 tonnes a year of copper cathode and Tiger is looking to double that
by expanding its new plant at the site in a region that has attracted miners like Glencore and China's
MMG Ltd.
Tiger, which has been trying to buy Gecamines' stake in Kipoi for at least two years, said it aims to
raise A$73 million ($68 million) through the sale of new shares to institutions and existing
shareholders and $100 million in debt arranged with fund manager Taurus to help fund the purchase.

The shares are being offered at A$0.30, in line with Tiger's last traded price.
The $111 million price for the 40 percent stake was a good buy for Tiger compared with the A$180
million valuation the market had on a 40 percent stake in Kipoi, Foster Stockbroking director Mark
Hinsley said.

Analysts said with Tiger set to take full ownership of the low-cost, expandable mine, it could become
more attractive to potential suitors, especially as the company is trading at a steep discount to broker
valuations.

"We think the corporate appeal of Tiger has also improved, as Gecamines would have been considered
to be a 'poison pill' for many potential acquirers," Hinsley said.
