SALES: With 2014 emerging as the year of the property mega-sale, Brisbane is the latest city to
catch the trend.

Joint venture partners Stockland and the Future Fund have confirmed plans to sell the $600 million
Waterfront Place office tower in the city.

While the listed group emphasised the move was in line with its strategy to selectively downweight
its exposure to office towers and shift into retail, business parks and logistics properties, the move is
timed to capture some of the heat in the market.
Cbus Property is on track to offload $1 billion worth of towers in Melbourne by the end of the month
and GIC Real Estate and partners Dexus Property Group and Perron Group are selling prize
$400m properties in Sydney, each of which can sustain $1bn residential developments.
China’s Wanda swooped on a Gold Coast site where a $1bn three-tower complex is under way and
has flagged larger ambitions in Australia.

Brisbane’s Waterfront Place tower is not for developers and the vendors will keep Eagle Street Pier.
Instead it is being promoted as the first opportunity since 2009 to secure a full interest in an existing
premium grade Australian office tower.

CBRE and JLL will jointly manage the international expressions of interest campaign.And it is
unlikely that the campaign will be the last mega-sale of the year.
