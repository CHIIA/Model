Fosun Group (复星集團), which has played a major role in three take-private deals of US listed
pharmaceutical firms and hospital operator, is mulling an investment in private equity-owned Australian
hospital operator Healthscope, highlighting its growth potential in China.

Patrick Zhong, Fosun's head of global investment, said Fosun is really interested in the growth
opportunities presented by China. "Healthscope is a pretty large company, but think about if they had the
same position in China. The counterpart of Healthscope would be huge, 10 times larger potentially. This
is the opportunity," he added.

TPG Capital and The Carlyle Group (凱雷集團) bought Healthscope for A$1.99 billion in 2011 and
subsequently took it private. Currently TPG Capital and The Carlyle Group are considering exit options for
Healthscope, with a A$4 billion (US$3.7 billion) initial public offering, a trade sale and an exit into a
property trust all seen as possibilities.

First-round bids from potential buyers were reportedly due on April 24. A decision on whether to push on
with a bid or move to a public offering is expected in about a month. Hospital Corporation of America
(HCA) is said to be among the bidders.

Healthscope operates more than 4,500 inpatient beds in 33 hospitals, four dedicated mental health
hospitals and four rehabilitation centers across Australia, as well as managing three hospitals on behalf of
ACHA Group. It owns and operates around 60 medical centers and specialist skin clinics. Operations
stretch to pathology, with services provided in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia. It also
provides residential and attendant care in Australia.
The company reported an operating EBITDA of A$328.1 million for the year ended June 2013, up 8.3%
year-on-year, while revenues rose 4.5% to A$2.2 billion. Due to impairment charges arising from the sale
of certain pathology assets, lease charges and other costs, a net loss of A$117.1 million was recorded for
the period.
