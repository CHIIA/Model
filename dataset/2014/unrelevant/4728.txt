Deal of the week
Frasers Centrepoint Ltd. is now on track to take control of Australand Property Group after it won over
the remaining shareholders it needed to get past the mandated threshold.

TD

Rival suitor Stockland dashed hedge fund hopes of an 11th-hour counterbid and is apparently scoping out
Leighton Properties' A$7 billion in assets instead. The Australian firm may have to duke it out with
another Singapore competitor, in this case City Developments Ltd., which is also interested in the
residential and commercial portfolio.

Reuters called it a "bumper year" for Australian M&A, with international buyers in particular tapping into
the country's safe-haven assets. The news service reported, citing J.P. Morgan, that Australian
transactions totaled $79 billion in the first half, compared to $45 million in the year-ago period.

Other activity
* Speaking of overseas investment in Australia, Chinese behemoth Sunshine Insurance Group is said to
be eyeing Sydney's Sheraton on the Park hotel for a record A$465 million, with competition from other
international bidders, including Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. as
well as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
* Singapore-listed Aspial Corp., meanwhile, is buying a development site in Brisbane, Australia, from
Cornerstone Properties for about A$36 million.

* Lend Lease Corp. Ltd. released the retail component of its A$6 billion Barangaroo South development in
Sydney's central business district, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review reported.
The company is close to signing at least half a dozen tenants at the project, which will have 80 retail
tenancies in seven retail precincts.

Lend Lease will offer the first right to invest in the retail component to existing investors in the Barangaroo
office towers, including Dutch pension fund APG, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Lend Lease's
APPF Commercial fund, First State Super and Telstra Super.

Eye on earnings

* In Singapore, Global Logistic Properties Ltd. said that profit after tax and minority interests dropped 12%
to $179.4 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 from $204 million a year ago.

* GLP compatriot CapitaLand Ltd. said its first-half PATMI rose 9.2% year over year to S$621.5 million
from S$569.3 million. Operating PATMI came in at S$292.2 million, up 30.3% from S$224.3 million in the
previous year.

* Japanese bigwig Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd. reported a 6.2% year-over-year decline in second-quarter net
income to ¥15.74 billion from ¥16.77 billion.
