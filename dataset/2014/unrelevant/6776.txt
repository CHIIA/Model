MARKET TRADES QUIETLY HIGHER
Our market was quietly higher, with much reason for caution and little in company or eco reports to inspire
today.

"Support at 5310, resistance at 5335, followed by 5350 .. I'll call us up 25 points' Ben Faulkner, a senior
adviser with Morgans said, "Starting with gold, I suggested yesterday that traders will begin to take profits.
There was a bit of a sell off last night - also Deutsche Bank was telling clients to short the stock.

Page274of315©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."$1360 should be good support, gold is still in a strong uptrend. The 20 day moving average is at about
$1340.

"Looking at the Shanghai market, it had a pretty savage sell off in mid February and the chart is still
medium term bearish - has been in downtrend since November last year. It is encouraging to see the 2000
level of strong support that held in January in the sell off remains strong support.

"The Shanghai market is still in a short term downtrend, trading below the 3 month moving average.
Resistance is at 2050. A break of 2050 is needed before we see any confirmation of a neutral or bullish
breakout.

"With regard to the S&P 500, support held around the 1840 level, it broke back and closed above the 20
day moving average. Support is still around 1845. There is still room to move to the upside before we
experience resistance at 1870. That picture improved over night.

"On the XJO, interestingly the index closed right on the 50 and 100 day moving average yesterday.
Support remains at 5295. Resistance remains at about 5350. A key level to watch this week is 5350.

"With regard to intra day levels, support is at 5310, initial resistance at 5335 followed by 5350.

"For the day I will call us up 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 11.8 points to 6317.6 points last evening.

RBA Minutes of the meeting on March 4

"Considerations for Monetary Policy

The pace of growth of Australia's major trading partners appeared to have remained around average.
Domestically, timely indicators were consistent with some improvement in economic conditions over recent
months, and there were further signs that the expansionary setting of monetary policy was having the
desired effects. Indicators had been generally positive for consumption, housing investment, business
conditions and exports. Mining investment had declined and was expected to fall further, while
non-mining investment remained subdued and was expected to pick up gradually over time. Wage growth
was at quite low rates, and if domestic costs remained contained some moderation in inflation for
non-traded goods and services could be expected over time. These conditions would be expected to keep
inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate. While the labour market
remained weak, forward-looking indicators of labour demand appeared to have stabilised.
"At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged, while
noting that the cash rate could remain at its current level for some time if the economy was to evolve
broadly as expected. Developments since the previous meeting had supported that assessment. There
were further signs that low interest rates were providing support to activity, with improved economic
conditions evident across a range of household and business indicators. While the labour market was
expected to remain subdued for a while and wage growth had declined, the Board observed that this was
consistent with conditions in the labour market usually lagging changes in economic activity. The decline in
the exchange rate seen to date would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though
members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards.
In light of this assessment, the Board's judgement was that it would be appropriate to maintain the current
stance of policy. The Board would continue to examine the data over the period ahead, with members
noting that, if the economy was to evolve broadly as expected, then the most prudent course was likely to
be a period of stability in interest rates.

The Decision
"The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent"
