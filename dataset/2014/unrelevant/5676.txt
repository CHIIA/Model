Orgin Energy has to act after agreeing to fork up to US $800 million for a stake in a new gas project off
the Western Australian coast. The company is Australia's largest electricity retailer and generator, has
taken a potential second major liquefied natural gas (LNG) project before its flagship $24.7 billion
Queensland project comes online. Origin struck a deal to buy junior Karoon Gas's 40%b interest in the
Poseidon discovery in WA's Browse Basin. Investors were asking what the company planned to do with
the extra $1 billion in cash flow its Australia Pacific LNG project would eventually start delivering. The
answer is that is setting itself up through this investment and has a very good opportunity to reinvest part
of those cashflows for continued development. It is balancing the risks of acting now versus the risks of
not acting at all. Origin saw the gasfields as potentially producing a 45-year LNG project.

Origin's partner in APLNG, US energy giant ConocoPhillips is the project operator of the Poseidon gas
fields, and PetroChina holds a major stake. Origin plans to conduct a $1 billion equity offer after August
to help pay for the deal.
