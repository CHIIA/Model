CHINESE development giant China Poly Group has joined the wave of major Asian groups in the
Australian apartment market, paying $110 million for a site at Epping in Sydney’s northwest.
The 8314sq m Cambridge Office Park site, at 20-28 Cambridge Street, was offloaded by Goodman
Group as it continues to sell its industrial properties to residential developers. The deal was
foreshadowed in The Australian last month Goodman, Poly and the agents on the deal, JLL’s Sam
Brewer and Ben Hunter, declined to comment last night. The site can accommodate 500 apartments
plus commercial space.

The state-owned China Poly Group has a Shanghai-listed commercial property arm, Poly Real
Estate, and a Hong Kong-listed arm, Poly Property.
Founded in 1992, it is one of the biggest companies in China, specialising in international trade, and
real estate.

Poly has been scouring the Australian market for more than a year in the hope of cashing in on the
Australian apartment boom.
Another Chinese company, Visionary Investment Group, also moves closer to the purchase of a
Sydney CBD office building with apartment development potential at 338 Pitt Street for about
$100m.The building is being sold by the AMP Wholesale Office Fund.
