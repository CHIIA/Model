Political/commercial background: Foreign investment

Australia welcomes foreign investment, since the country faces considerable challenges finding capital to
finance growth. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 provides the legislative framework for
foreign investment. In certain circumstances, the act requires prospective investors to submit proposals
to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which restricts investments based on the investor's
identity and specified monetary limits. The FIRB also tends to limit investments in "sensitive" sectors,
such as airlines, airports, banking, defence, encryption and security technology, media, nuclear energy,
real property, shipping, and telecommunications, among others (see Basic investment approval).

Investors need approval from the FIRB to pursue projects in sensitive sectors. Approval also is required
for companies whose proposed projects exceed various capital limits established by the FIRB. These
limits are adjusted annually for inflation, and the general limit was set at A$248m for 2014, unchanged
from 2013. Investment in developed commercial real estate is limited to A$5m-A$54m, depending on
whether the property in question is "heritage listed" by the Australian government. Free-trade
agreements (FTA) between Australia and New Zealand (Investment Protocol to the Australia-New
Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement) and Australia and the US (Australia-US FTA)
raise the general threshold for New Zealand and US companies to A$1.078bn for 2014 but keep it at
A$248m for New Zealand and US investments in "sensitive" sectors. For 2014 the A$1.078bn limit also
applies to New Zealand and US investments in developed commercial real property (see Acquisition of
real estate).

In its annual Trade and Assistance Review for fiscal year 2012/13 (June-July), released on June 27th
2014, the Australian government's Productivity Commission recommended that the FIRB raise limits for
all countries to A$1.078bn. It also recommended eliminating barriers to foreign investment, such as on
national airline Qantas, national telecom Telstra, airports, and media. The QantasSale Amendment Bill
2014, introduced to Parliament in March 2014, seeks to remove foreign ownership restrictions on Qantas
(currently a foreign firm may own only up to 25% of the airline); the bill was awaiting parliamentary action
as of end-August 2014.

Most investment projects beyond the sensitive sectors and below the relevant investment limits do not
need FIRB approval. However, the FIRB may block any investment that it deems as "contrary to national
interest".

Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows stood at A$91.3bn in 2013 compared to A$92.2bn in 2012,
according to the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Data from the ABS show that the profile of the
sectors that attract the most investment is changing. The financial industry, which for many years has
been the largest recipient of inward investment, was surpassed in 2010 by the mining sector. According
to the ABS, on a country level, FDI inflows to Australia in 2013 were dominated by the US (at A$31.7bn,
or close to 35% of total inflows), followed by China (A$8.8bn, or 9.6%), Japan (A$6.6bn, 7.2%), Bermuda
(A$4.1bn, 4.5%), South Korea (A$3.7bn, 4.0%), and the Netherlands (A$3.5bn, 3.8%). FDI inflows from
China have increased more than fortyfold over the past decade, from A$218m in 2003.

According to the most recent data from the FIRB, A$135.7bn in investment was approved in 2012/13,
down from A$170.7bn in 2011/12. The FIRB considered 13,322 proposals in 2012/13, approved 12,731

145 that were determined not to require the FIRB's approval. The FIRB's statistics offer only a rough
guide to actual foreign investment since they include proposals that were approved but never
implemented, and proposals whose investments may be spread over several years.

There is no discrimination in Australia's capital markets against foreign-owned companies seeking credit
or loan facilities. The absence of exchange controls provides great fund-raising flexibility.
