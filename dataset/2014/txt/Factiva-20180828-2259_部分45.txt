Australia's Freedom Foods Group and Perich Group have signed an agreement with China's New Hope
Group that sees millions invested in Australian dairy farms.

Under a Memorandum of Understanding, signed on Tuesday (18 November), the parties will work to
develop and implement growth in long term dairy milk supply, through the establishment of new "large
scale intensive" dairy farms in South East Australia, for supply to Freedom's operations and other
potential dairy processing operations in Australia.

Rory Macleod, MD of Freedom Foods Group said: "Australia has a unique advantage in the supply and
manufacture of high quality premium agriculture based foods. With increasing demand from markets in
China and SE Asia for high quality value added product, Australia, through companies such as Freedom
Foods Group and Perich Group, are well placed to play an important role in the development of this
supply chain".

New Hope has established an investment fund of A$500m for the development of agricultural and food
processing activities in Australia, with "a substantial proportion" to be invested in long term dairy farm
and processing activities.
Under the agreement, Freedom Foods Group and New Hope Dairy have agreed to build on the existing
relationship for the supply of UHT dairy milk for export and sale in China through a number of
initiatives. These include reviewing other processing opportunities in dairy milk both in Australia and
overseas, as well as the development of a business plan to take existing and/or new products Freedom
Foods products for sale in China.
