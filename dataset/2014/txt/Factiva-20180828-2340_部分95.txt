THE PUSH by private equity funds to buy mining assets is slowing as investors struggle to land major
deals while commodity prices slide.
The funds have raised $1.1 billion (R12bn) for investments in mining and metals this year, compared
with about $8.8bn last year. Less than $2bn has been spent by the funds on mining assets in the past
two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence research.

"When private equity makes an investment they say they want to be out in three to five years," David
Williams, the managing director of corporate adviser Kidder Williams, said at Bloomberg's "Beyond The
Boom: Mining to Dining" seminar in Melbourne.
Making bets on producers of commodities from coal to almonds was less certain, he said. "What I see
in mining is a risk in pricing."
Funds, including those led by former Xstrata chief executive Mick Davis and ex-Barrick Gold boss
Aaron Regent, are said to have examined targets from Peru to South Africa. Few have completed
major deals even as mining firms sold $53bn of assets in the past 12 months.
Price declines in commodities from copper to iron ore might be leaving investors wary over
opportunities for returns, Simon Mawhinney, a portfolio manager at Allan Gray Australia, said.
"Private equity funds are opportunistic and most of the assets that have made their way to market so
far in the resources space are assets that don't generate positive free cash flow at current commodity
prices," Mawhinney said. "For anyone to buy them is risky."
Iron ore has slumped 38 percent this year as producers have increased output.
BHP Billiton plans to spin off a collection of operations from South African thermal coal to an
Australian silver mine into a new company next year rather than pursue asset sales. Broker valuations
for the new company range from $8bn to $17bn.

"Trade sales probably didn't eventuate at the prices they thought were fair value," said Michelle Lopez,
an executive at Aberdeen Asset Management. "I'd assume there were buyers out there, but what they
were willing to pay wasn't in line with what BHP Billiton wanted."
Davis's X2 Resources was said in April to be studying some BHP Billiton thermal coal and nickel
assets, while Regent's Magris Resources was said last year to have been considering a bid for
Glencore's Las Bambas. A consortium led by China Minmetals agreed in April to pay $5.85bn for the
copper development project in Peru.
"Private equity hasn't been able to put its hands on anything significant in mining," said Alberto
Calderon, a board member of Orica, which supplies mining explosives, and a former BHP Billiton
executive. "It hasn't happened and I wouldn't think that it's going to happen in any material way."

addressed.
While private equity investors might have concerns over weaker commodity prices "contributors to
these funds are unlikely to wait much longer to see their investments put to use", auditing firm E&Y
said last month. Mining acquisitions might increase in the next 12 months as investors sought assets
when valuations were at their lowest, it added.
QKR, a mining investor founded by former JPMorgan Chase banker Lloyd Pengilly, agreed in February
to a $110 million deal for AngloGold Ashanti's Navachab mine in Namibia. Calderon invested in May in
Gulf Alumina, which is developing bauxite projects in Australia.
"For small deals, there's a role for private equity," Calderon said on Monday. "In deals between $10m
and $30m, in this current environment, there [will] be interesting opportunities." - Bloomberg
