Among the companies whose shares are making notable moves in Monday's session are Pan
American Silver Corp. (PAAS), Cameco Corp. (CCJ) and Churchill Corp. (CUQ.T).
Pan American Silver (C$14.47, up 2.2%) said silver and gold production hit record highs in 2013 of 26
million ounces and 149,800 ounces, respectively.

TD upgraded Cameco (C$24.84, up 3.1%) to 'buy' from 'hold,' saying 2014 could be a pivotal year for
uranium as the restart of more reactors in Japan could support an improved outlook for uranium
prices. The investment bank also raised its target price on the stock to C$31 from C$22.

TD raised its recommendation on Churchill (C$10.05, up 3.7%) to 'buy' from 'hold' on expectations of a
turnaround in the company's general-contracting segment.

20 Jan 2014 14:15 EDT Canada Hot Stocks: BlackBerry, Paladin Energy

Among the companies whose shares are making notable moves in Monday's session are BlackBerry
Ltd. (BBRY) and Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN.T).

Shares of BlackBerry (C$10.86, up 8.8%), which hit a 10-year low in December, continue to recover
after new Chief Executive John Chen announced the smartphone maker would outsource its hardware
business to Foxconn Technology Group and concentrate on services and the enterprise segment.
Paladin Energy (C$0.62, up 12.7%) sold a 25% stake in its Langer Heinrich uranium mine in Australia
to China National Nuclear Corp. in a deal that eases near-term liquidity pressures. RBC upgraded the
stock to 'outperform' from 'sector perform' on continuing operational improvements and expectations of
stronger uranium prices.
