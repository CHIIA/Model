Iron ore magnate Gina Rinehart has snapped up a 50 per cent stake in two West Australian cattle
stations in a bid to capitalise on booming food exports to Asia.
The nation's richest person on Wednesday confirmed her companyHancock Prospecting – which is
building the mammoth Roy Hilliron ore project in the Pilbara – had purchased the stake.

Mrs Rinehart said Australia's north has vast potential as a food producer. "We are well placed to meet
the growing needs of our Asian neighbours," she said in a statement.

"My family has had a long history in the West Australian pastoral industry with our interest continuing
over generations in Mulga Downs Station in the Pilbara."

Hancock now owns half of the sprawling Liveringa and Nerrima cattle stations in the West Kimberly
region in a joint venture called Liveringa Station Beef (LSB). The two properties cover about 470,000
hectares and span the Fitzroy river.

Hancock's joint venture partner is Dowford Investments, which is owned by the Laitt family and is the
parent company of WA agribusiness group Milne Agrigroup.
The total transaction value to establish the LSB joint venture is in excess of $65 million. The fee Mrs
Rinehart paid for her stake was not disclose, but media reports suggested it was around $40 million.
The move comes just months after fellow iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest bought the Harvey Beef
Group and added two large WA cattle stations to the Minderoo station he bought for $12 million in
2009.
LSB managing director Graham Laitt said the mining magnates were already taking Australian
primary produce and shipping it to offshore markets.
"In many ways the challenges they face [in mining] are the challenges we are facing [in agriculture]
and the markets they sell into are the markets we want to sell into. In some ways they've laid down the
road for us," he said.

"The demand for product is huge and there is an opportunity for Australia as supplier,"

He said LSB is moving away from live exports and towards boxed beef and has purchased the
mothballed Waroona Abattoirs formerly known as Clover Meats.

Western Australian beef farmers claimed the investments by Mrs Rinehart and Mr Forrest were a
"massive vote of confidence" in an industry beginning to rebuild from recent lows.

Tony Abrook, president of the Pastoralists and Graziers' Association of Western Australia, said both
billionaires were raised on WA beef farms and understood the local industry.

The industry nearly collapsed following the ban on live exports by the previous federal Labor
government, he said. "It was a massive financial setback. The farms became unsaleable and debts
jumped. The industry is now getting back on its feet and there is a great sense of optimism." He added
Mr Forrest's planned push of beef exports into China was also boosting sentiment.

But others warned the concentration of the beef processing industry in foreign hands had routinely
resulted in local output being reduced in favour of cheaper overseas markets.
