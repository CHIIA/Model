23:19 GMT [Dow Jones] KKR & Co. (KKR) and Rhone Capital's A$5.20/share indicative offer to acquire
Treasury Wine (TWE.AU) looks attractive, but several risks remain, says J.P.Morgan. Investors should
be mindful of the experience of Goodman Fielder, which recently recommended a cut-price offer from
Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. (F34.SG) and Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. (0142.HK) after they
wrapped up due diligence. "There is no guarantee that a bid (for TWE) will emerge post due diligence, let
alone that it will remain at A$5.20 per share," J.P.Morgan says.

"This risk requires a discount." Also, the broker believes the best-case completion date is September
2015, with due diligence likely to take four to six weeks, a scheme meeting taking six weeks to arrange,
and the deal almost certain to require approval from China's Ministry of Commerce. J.P.Morgan, which
rates Treasury Wine at underweight, thinks the stock should be trading at A$4.80/share. TWE last traded
at A$5.17.

23:19 GMT [Dow Jones] The rally in Treasury Wine Estate's (TWE.AU) share price suggests more
downside risk than upside for investors, even against the backdrop of a raised bid from KKR and Rhone
Group, says UBS. It lifts its sum-of-the-parts-based target on TWE to A$4.33/share from A$4.20 but
retains a sell recommendation. The brokerage says TWE's strategy, including spending on a narrowed
brand portfolio and bringing forward the release dates for premium wines, makes sense but execution
isn't certain. It anticipates further cost cutting to accompany the upcoming fiscal 2014 results as well as
possibly more impairment charges, which will further cloud the wine company's near-term earnings
outlook. TWE closed Tuesday at A$5.17. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

23:07 GMT [Dow Jones] Harold Park in suburban Sydney is used to winners and losers, as the site of a
former paceway where punters would gather to bet on harness racing. Now, it looks like paying off for
Mirvac Group, an Australian property developer that dug up the track and is building dozens of
apartments there. J.P.Morgan says Mirvac's FY15 earnings growth will be dependent on the margin at
Harold Park, as it likely will provide more than 50% of residential revenue. "We're increasingly confident
on Harold Park given sales are 18 months ahead of feasibilities where Mirvac's focus has been more on
velocity of sales as opposed to price growth," the broker says. "This should ensure healthy project
margins through FY15-18, and more than A$1 billion in revenue." J.P.Morgan, which rates Mirvac at
overweight with a A$1.93 price target, expects the company to report an FY14 operating profit of
A$439.9 million on Aug. 21. MGR last traded at A$1.78. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2306 GMT [Dow Jones] Xerox Corp. (XRX) is moving toward rapid prototyping of services in its
innovation group, according to chief technology officer Sophie Vandebroek. The copy machine pioneer
needs to innovate in services now that the company has transitioned to providing back office services.
Xerox is taking a page from a software development method known as Agile, which focuses on smaller
projects and quick iteration. Innovation may be needed on the services side to offset falling sales of
printers and copiers in the most recent quarter. (rachael.king@wsj.com, @sfwriter)

23:00 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY is likely to consolidate the downside after renewed concerns over
the Ukrainian situations stoked risk-averse sentiment among investors overnight. "The sentiment isn't
good and the topside will be heavy," says Shinji Kureda, head of FX trading group at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking. But the market reaction to this sort of news tends to be short-lived, and the pair could be

Page197of417©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.supported around 102.40. Meanwhile, the topside will likely be capped around 102.80. The pair is at
102.63 against 102.59 in late New York on Tuesday. Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, was
quoted by Bloomberg News as saying Russian units are poised to pressure or invade Ukraine.

22:55 GMT [Dow Jones] RBCCM upgrades Downer (DOW.AU) to Outperform from Sector Perform after
raising its target price to A$5.20 from A$5.00. The broker points to significantly lower debt, a share
buyback and marginally higher forecasts behind the upgrade. "The irony for Downer is that whilst it has
reported a very strong cash flow result, its share price has fallen," analyst Heath Andrews says. "On a
relative basis, we see Downer as good value in the sector and believe it should rally on the back of what
was a solid FY2014 result." It adds that Downer is trading at a 6.3 times expected FY2015 enterprise
value to earnings before interest and tax, a 23% discount to peers. DOW last A$4.58.

2248 GMT [DOW JONES]--Federal regulators gave a sharp rebuke to banks over bankruptcy scenarios
the regulators said weren't realistic. But it could still take years for the government to take drastic action,
like forcing the banks to break up or shrink. Banks will have a least a year, and as many as three years,
to respond to the regulators' criticisms, and even then breaking up the banks might not be on the table,
one senior Fed official said.(ryan.tracy@wsj.com)

18:53 EDT [Dow Jones] After Imperial Metals (III.T) said earlier Tuesday the tailings dam breach at its
Mount Polley copper and gold mine in British Colubmia had stabilized but it couldn't estimate the amount
of tailings released, the provincial government provided some additional detail, saying an estimated 10M
cubic meters of water as well as 4.5 million cubic meters of fine sand were released into Polley Lake.
Still, government wasn't ready to estimate the potential environment impact from the spill. Amid that
uncertainty, it's no wonder III.T sunk 41% to C$9.98. ben.dummett@wsj.com @bendummett)

22:47 GMT [Dow Jones} Cochlear (COH.AU) shares surged 10% Tuesday on a more positive outlook
than many investors expected. For Credit Suisse, however, there was enough concern in the
hearing-implant maker's results to balance the good news. The broker upgraded its earnings forecast by
at least 3% for each of the next two years, and lifted its price target by 20% to A$57.00/share. "However,
our ongoing concern relates to Cochlear's implant unit sales, which achieved only 4% underlying growth
in 2H14, ex-China tender sales," Credit Suisse says. This compares to a 15% compound annual growth
rate during FY06-FY11. "While it's difficult to ascertain whether this was due to a slowdown in global
industry growth or continued share loss, Sonova Holding's (SOON.VX) strong performance in its 2H
period suggests it was predominantly the latter." Credit Suisse rates Cochlear at underperform. COH last
traded at A$69.00. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1834 EDT [DOW JONES]--Projections for a bumper harvest have pushed prices for staple feed
ingredients to the lowest levels in four years, widening margins for livestock producers during a time
when both cattle and hogs are selling for the highest per-pound prices in history. Some analysts now
expect that hog farmers will use the extra cash to expand herds battered by disease, booking profits
even as more animals come to market. "Even with the discount in December hogs, a producer can still
make a lot of money raising pigs," said Jim Clarkson, analyst with A&A Trading in Chicago. CME August
hogs down 0.1% to $1.1575/lb in electronic trade, while December hog futures are off 0.03% to
93.97c/lb. (kelsey.gee@wsj.com; @kelseykgee)

18:20 EDT - FirstSolar (FSLR) shares tumble 4% after hours to $61.05 following lower 2Q earnings that
widely miss analysts' expectations. FSLR posted 2Q net income of $4.5M, or 4c/share, vs $33.6M, 37c a
year earlier. Analysts expected $30M, 33c/share, according to FactSet. CEO Jim Hughes said project
delays pushed FSLR earnings to later in the year, company maintains 2014 EPS forecast of
$2.40-$2.80. (cassandra.sweet@wsj.com)

18:14 EDT - Falling grain prices are lifting profits for livestock farmers and some of the drug companies
that supply them, according to Zoetis (ZTS), No. 1 company in a $22B market for animal medicine. ZTS
said today that low prices for corn -- a main ingredient in livestock feed -- as well as high prices for
slaughter-ready animals, has boosted revenue for producers, allowing them to invest more into vaccines
and drugs for livestock like cattle and swine. Producers are increasingly "allocating part of their profits to
protect their animals better," CEO Juan Ramon Alaix said. ZTS said 2Q earnings rose to $136M vs
$128M a year earlier, driven by strong US sales. Sales in its livestock segment grew 9%. Total revenue
rose 4% to $1.16B. (jesse.newman@wsj.com; @jessenewman13)
