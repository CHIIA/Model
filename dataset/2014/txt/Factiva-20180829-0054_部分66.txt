DETAILS of seven residential and commercial towers in the Cairns CBD, a hotel extension and a
substantial start on a southern corridor housing subdivision are to be announced in coming weeks.

Cairns Deputy Mayor Terry James revealed the projects at a Cairns Chamber of Commerce lunch
yesterday which discussed investments in the region “with or without” the $8.15 billion Aquis
mega-resort.

He told guests that there were “several large projects in their early stages”. These included land
subdivisions and large-scale inner city developments. Later he told The Cairns Post they included: 1.
Singapore’s Aspial Corporation’s $200 million project involving seven towers (six residential and one
commercial, with 1500 units) in Spence St behind the police station and courthouse.
2. Chinese businessman Benny Wu’s extension of Acacia Court Hotel, the Esplanade.

3. The first $10 million stages of the 3000 lot Satterley housing subdivision, Mt Peter.

Cr James said that deve-lopers were seeking extensions of time for previously unviable projects.

“The number of pre-lodgement inquiries has climbed as has the scale of projects being promoted,’’ he
said.

Cr James said there had been a 40 per cent rise in development applications with 409 lodged this year
to date “the highest in the past four years”.

“We will expect a lot more after today’s (Aquis) announcement,’’ he said. Aspial Corporation bought
the 24,109sq m Spence St property for $18.9 million this year.
At the time the company said it was planning a “mega-integrated development’’. Chief executive Koh
Wee Seng said the land would be used for a mega-integrated development with about 111,520sq m of
residential units and offices.
“The group sees potential in Cairns’ property market which is anticipated to be on the road to
recovery,’’ he said.
Details of the Acacia Court Hotel expansion and Satterley’s subdivision are being sought.

Urban Development Institute of Australia Far North president Adam Gowlett said there were 858
blocks of land being constructed in Cairns with most already sold.

He said the majority were on the Northern Beaches (516) with 254 in the southern corridor, the largest
number in the past five years.

Mr Gowlett said the first stages of Satterley’s Mt Peter project were tied into the construction of a new
Catholic school. He said the 858 in Cairns were “back to a reasonable position” but the industry had “a
lot of work to do” to start unit construction.

was “surging back”.

He said that holiday visitor numbers were set to hit a record this year.He said spending was set to
“explode” over the next six years to between $3.9 billion and $4.6 billion (rises of between 51 per cent
and 78 per cent), creating 12,000 additional direct jobs in tourism and 8000 indirectly.
