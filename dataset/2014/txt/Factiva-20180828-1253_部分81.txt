Treasury Wine Gets Rival Takeover Bid From TPG--3rd Update

SYDNEY---A takeover fight has broken out between two of the world's biggest buyout firms for an
Australian winemaker that produces California's mass-market Beringer brand as well as the premium
local Penfolds label.
U.S. private-equity firm TPG is behind a 3.38 billion Australian dollar (US$3.14 billion) rival bid for
Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. that matches one made days earlier by KKR & Co. and Rhone Group LLC,
said a person familiar with the matter.

The heightened level of bidding interest comes in spite of Treasury Wine's troubles in the U.S., where it
continues to face weak sales, and intensifying competition at home. Some analysts, however, have
suggested potential acquirers could spin off the company's more lucrative Penfolds business, or sell
its more poorly performing U.S. assets, to justify a higher bid.

The world's second-biggest listed winemaker said Monday that it had received a nonbinding takeover
proposal from a private-equity firm it didn't identify at A$5.20 a share. Treasury Wine has given the
new bidder access to its books, according to the company, which said the private-equity firm's offer
wouldn't necessarily lead to a formal proposal.

Last week, KKR and Rhone also offered A$5.20 a share--10.6% above a A$4.70-a-share proposal by
KKR acting alone in April. KKR and Rhone have also been given permission to carry out due diligence.

"On a sum of the parts basis, TPG and KKR may believe that they can create some additional value by
breaking up the group," said Brad King, a director and portfolio manager at Melbourne-based Armytage
Private. "But assuming the business operates in its current state, A$5.20 represents a pretty attractive
price given the risks involved."

The vintner's shares rose as much as 4.3% in Sydney to A$5.35 on Monday, a sign some investors
expect the competing suitors to fight it out. Private-equity firms including KKR, Blackstone Group L.P.
and TPG are flush with cash after taking advantage of buoyant share markets to sell earlier investments
worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
Treasury Wine became more vulnerable to a takeover in July 2013, when poor sales of cheaper brands
such as Beringer forced the company to destroy thousands of gallons of wine that had passed the
drink-by date and book a A$155 million write-down.
Problems have plagued Melbourne-based Treasury Wine since its 2011 spinoff from Australian brewer
Foster's Group, which was later bought by SABMiller. Back then, a glut of Australian grapes and weak
sales in the U.S. weighed on profit, contributing to a A$1 billion write-down of the business before the
spinoff.
TPG could be hoping to return Beringer back to its former glory, having already owned the brand back
in the 1990s before selling it to Foster's in 2000.

In recent years, U.S. consumers have been developing a taste for more expensive wines than many of
those currently produced for that market by Treasury Wine. The Australian dollar's stubborn strength
has also made the winemaker's products less attractive than competing vintages from rival regions such

just over a year ago--but remains high by historical standards.
Treasury Wine is also facing increasing competition in Australia from a wave of New Zealand imports,
while a Chinese crackdown on extravagant gift-giving as part of an anticorruption drive has stalled
sales in the world's second-biggest economy.
