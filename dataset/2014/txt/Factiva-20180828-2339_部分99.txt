SYDNEY-- Arrium Ltd. decided two years ago to branch out into the iron-ore market to offset waning
demand for its core product, steel.
Now, with iron-ore prices tumbling, the Australian company says it will seek to reduce debt by
issuing 754 million Australian dollars (US$681 million) in new shares.

The shares will be issued at 48 Australian cents each. That is 26% below the stock's closing price of
65 Australian cents a share on Monday. The amount of cash raised will nearly match the company's
market value of A$888 million. The company had A$1.71 billion in net debt on June 30.
"While the company last month reported it had achieved significant progress with debt reduction,
iron-ore prices have fallen significantly in the last month to five-year lows and there is increased
uncertainty over the extent and timing of recovery," Arrium Chairman Peter Smedley said in a written
statement Monday.
Prices for iron ore, which is used to make steel, have fallen as supply rises and China's growth
slows. Spot prices are around US$82 a metric ton, less than half the high of US$190 reached in
2011, but still more than five times the level of 2004.
Big mining companies such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton continue to increase production because
efficiencies of scale allow them to profit. That makes it harder for smaller operators such as Arrium to
break even.
Mining costs at Arrium's Southern Iron operation in Western Australia are around US$89 a metric
ton, exceeding the current spot price, Credit Suisse estimated this month. Contractual commitments
to customers and costs associated with idling the mine could pressure the company to keep
producing.
"I'm surprised they didn't raise capital earlier," said Tim Schroeders, a fund manager at Pengana
Capital, which doesn't hold Arrium stock.
"It is probably a forgone opportunity by the board to raise equity at a much higher A$1.40 to A$1.50
per share," he said.
