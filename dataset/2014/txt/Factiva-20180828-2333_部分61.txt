BHP Billiton Foundation Pledges A$28.8 Million to
CSIRO STEM Project for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Students – 30/9/2014

30 September 2014 - BHP Billiton Chief Executive
Officer, Mr Andrew Mackenzie, today helped launch a
new A$28.8 million CSIRO education program aimed at
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

The program, funded through the BHP Billiton
Foundation, aims to increase interest and achievement
amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students

Page166of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM).

Mr Mackenzie launched the program in Canberra,
accompanied by the Minister for Industry, Hon Ian
Macfarlane MP and the Chief Executive of CSIRO, Dr
Megan Clark.

Mr Mackenzie said the program would build on the
CSIRO’s 30 year track record of improving educational
outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
students and BHP Billiton’s 33 year partnership with
CSIRO through its support of the Science and
Engineering Awards.

“Through the BHP Billiton Foundation, BHP Billiton is
delighted to partner with CSIRO in the promotion of
pathways that aim to increase Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander representation in STEM related
professions,” he said.

“BHP Billiton believes that providing opportunities in
STEM education is a powerful way to support the
professional aspirations and career opportunities of a
generation of young Aboriginal Australians.

“This latest long-term partnership commitment between
CSIRO and BHP Billiton is aligned not only to the
Foundation’s focus on STEM education but also the
company’s commitment to provide tangible
opportunities that support Aboriginal peoples with
education, training, employment and business
development.

“We hope the program encourages more Aboriginal
students to consider a rewarding career in the STEM
disciplines, which will go some way to further closing the
gap and recognising the important contribution
Aboriginal Australians make to the economy.”

CSIRO designed the five-year program, with six
integrated elements, building on already successful
education programs. The program will use hands-on,
inquiry based learning approaches and reward and
recognition for student achievement.

The BHP Billiton Foundation was established by BHP
Billiton as part of its community investment program.

A key focus area for the Foundation is Education:
promoting improved economic independence by
supporting activities that increase graduation rates and
employability of marginalised and disadvantaged
groups; increased profile, interest and uptake of STEM
amongst primary, secondary and tertiary students; and
the application and deployment of new science and
engineering technologies.

BHP Billiton and Pemex Sign Agreement to Exchange
Deepwater Expertise – 26/9/2014

26 September 2014 - BHP Billiton and Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) today signed a memorandum of
understanding and cooperation (MOU) to exchange
technical knowledge, information, experiences and
practices in activities related to the oil and gas industry.

Page167of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.On signing the MOU, BHP Billiton Petroleum and Potash
President, Tim Cutt said: “We see considerable
opportunity in Mexico following the recent economic
reforms, and we are excited about the deepwater and
the extension of the Paleogene play into the Perdido
play.

“We are very pleased to have the opportunity to work
with Pemex due to its exceptional capability and
experience. We are confident that we are one of the
lowest cost and best drillers in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. We have proven we can build projects better
and faster than most operators, and our offshore
facilities have some of the highest operational uptimes
and safety records anywhere in the world. We look
forward to sharing our technical knowledge and
experience with our Mexican partners.

“Shenzi is an excellent example of what we can do and
the deep capacity we possess within our offshore
organisation. Shenzi continues to be one of the great
success stories in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico –
whether it’s time from discovery to first production,
drilling costs, safety, uptime of approximately 95 per
cent or sustaining production levels.”

BHP Billiton can rapidly provide critical offshore
capacity. The Company’s state-of-the-art drilling rig,
Deepwater Invictus, arrived in the Gulf of Mexico in May
2014, and features world-class drilling capabilities which
can be rapidly deployed together with an experienced
drilling team. The Company also has considerable
design and development expertise from building the
Shenzi and Neptune platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and
the Pyrenees and Stybarrow FPSOs in Australia.

Mr Cutt said: “What we can offer is absolute focus as
Mexico seeks partners to help develop its enormous
petroleum resources. Right now, our global offshore
organisation is capable of moving with considerable
speed, safety, agility, and flexibility.”

Rio Tinto accelerates productivity drive with world-first
technology to enhance mineral recovery – 23/9/2014

Rio Tinto is set to capture a crucial advantage in the
recovery of mineral deposits, with the launch of its
revolutionary three-dimensional mapping technology to
reduce costs and improve the efficiency of mining
operations.

The new technology supports Rio Tinto's drive for
productivity improvements and cost reductions across its
high-quality, low-cost diversified portfolio of assets.

In a world-first under the next phase of its
industry-leading Mine of the Future™ programme, Rio
Tinto will be able to precisely identify the size, location
and quality of ore in real time by retrieving data from
automated trucks and drills operating in its mines.

Page168of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The RTVis™ 3D software provides pinpoint accurate
mapping which improves efficiency of mining activity by
ensuring it is tightly focused on removing high value ore,
significantly reducing both waste and operational costs.

RTVis™ creates 3D images of mine pit activities that
previously could not be measured. RTVis™ has led to
greater ore recovery through sharper boundary
identification, more accurate drill blasting, reduced
explosives, improved waste classification and enhanced
dig rates.

Rio Tinto head of innovation John McGagh said "This
technology allows us to quickly and easily view,
compare and evaluate data to paint a picture of what's
under the ground - it's like an ultrasound image of the
deposit delivered in real time, something that we could
never do before.

"RTVis™ is a low-cost application that complements
existing group-wide data technology in a way previously
never available to enhance our mining operations. It
quickly brings information to a much broader audience -
from a single operator in the field to an expert team in
the Rio Tinto Operations Centre in Perth.
"Armed with this detailed information, our operations to
recover the ore bodies will be significantly more efficient
and effective."

The new 3D technology is deployed at Rio Tinto's West
Angelas iron ore mine in Western Australia and trials
are also underway in other Rio Tinto product groups
including Copper, Energy and Diamonds and Minerals.

RTVis™ also provides rapid feedback on the impact to
equipment while another important benefit is in the area
of mine planning, providing much more certainty about
the nature of the ore deposit at an earlier stage of the
process.

RTVis™ will be demonstrated at the International
Mining and Resources Conference in Melbourne from
22-26 September.

Latest Research

Designing mine tailings for better environmental, social
and economic outcomes: a review of alternative
approaches

Mansour Edraki, Thomas Baumgartl, Emmanuel
Manlapig, Dee Bradshaw, Daniel M. Franks, Chris J.
Moran

Abstract
With the unprecedented rate of mining and mineral
processing over the past decade, there has been an
increasing level of concern worldwide about the fate of
tailings and the irreversible consequences of
contaminant release through dust, tailings dam
seepage, dam wall failure, or direct disposal of tailings
into waterways. It is likely that in the future the mining of

Page169of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.higher tonnages of lower grade ore and the possibility of
more extreme weather events associated with global
climatic change, may increase the risks associated with
mine tailings management. In this paper we review
alternative tailings management methods that aim to
improve environmental, social and economic outcomes.
Three approaches in particular are highlighted: paste
and thickened tailings; tailings reuse, recycling and
reprocessing; and proactive management (e.g. the
integration of sulphide flotation with cemented paste
backfill). The aim of the present study is to scope the
opportunities that could be gained by developing an
integrated research framework that traces tailings
properties back to the orebody. In the future models
could be constructed to optimise environmental, social
and economic outcomes of tailings management across
the value chain through integrated orebody
characterisation, mine planning, processing, disposal,
re-processing, recycling and reuse.

The Industry

Minerals Industry Will Need 18,000 New Employees To
2018

The release today of the Australian Workforce and
Productivity Agency’s (AWPA) latest report on the
resources sector’s skilled labour needs confirms that
mining will continue to expand in the years ahead,
providing a critical boost to the domestic economy.

The AWPA’s Resources Sector Skills Needs 2013 report
shows that minerals industry operations will need
around 18,000 more skilled workers through to 2018 –
as the sector moves from the construction to production
phase of the millennium mining boom.

The minerals industry has strong skills foundations in
place and welcomes AWPA’s acknowledgement of the
sector’s focus on the skilling and development of its
workforce. This includes:

Spending 5.5 per cent of payroll on training activities,
with one in twenty employees being an apprentice or a
trainee;

the contribution to higher education outcomes, with the
MCA-operated Minerals Tertiary Education Council
(MTEC) contributing $36 million since 1999 to tertiary
minerals disciplines;

Innovative efforts to overcome skills shortages via:

the MTEC Associate Degree program, designed to free
up the time of engineers and geologists by producing a
new cadre of educated technicians, who will have
pathways to full degree status;

programs to cross-train workers in different industry
disciplines such as the MCA/NFF/Commonwealth Skills
MOU and the Regional Agriculture and Mining
Integrated Training Initiative

Page170of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Efforts to encourage under-represented groups to take
part in the industry – specifically the increase in
indigenous participation (at 3.1 per cent, the highest
workforce participation rate of all industries) and women
(an increase in the percentage of female participants in
the minerals workforce from 11 per cent in 2003 to 16
per cent in August 2013).

The importance of Long Distance Commuting and
skilled migration to the skills needs of the industry.

Leading Companies

Arrium Ltd (ASE: ARI)
Arrium Mining Quarterly Production Report

For the quarter ended 30 June 2014

• Shipments of 3.16Mt (dmt), up 0.13Mt on prior quarter

• Record sales of 3.32Mt (dmt), up 0.13Mt on prior
quarter

• Record full year shipments of 12.5Mt (dmt), up 4.4Mt
on prior year

• Annualised shipment rate of ~13Mt (dmt) expected to
be achieved in 1Q FY15

• Average Platts market index price (62% Fe CFR)
US$103/dmt, down US$18/dmt on prior quarter

• Average realised price ~US$85/t CFR (dmt), down
US$25/t on prior quarter

• Average grade of shipments 59.6% Fe, average for full
year 59.9% Fe

• Average cash cost loaded on ship A$45.9/wmt, down
from A$47.4/wmt in prior period

• New tug fleet commissioned May – greater operational
weather resilience and faster barge towage
• Re-development of Iron Knob Mining Area
progressing in line with schedule and budget

• Completed ramp up of Magnetite expansion project

Market

The Platts 62% Fe index averaged US$103/t CFR (dmt),
a US$18/t decrease compared to the prior quarter.
Arrium’s average price of US$85/t CFR (dmt) was down
USS$25/t compared to the prior quarter. On an FOB
basis, Arrium’s average price was down US$23/t to
US$71/t (dmt) 4

.

In Australian dollars, Arrium’s average price for the
quarter was $92/t CFR (dmt), and $77/t (dmt) on an
FOB basis. Market prices were under pressure in the
quarter due to factors including increased discounting

Page171of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.related to additional supply (particularly lower grade
ores), the tightening of credit in China and higher port
stocks in China. Arrium’s realised CFR price as a
percentage of the Platts average price decreased
compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a significantly
lower premium for lump ores, increased shipments of
medium grade ores (largely related to the impact of
adverse weather on Southern Iron volumes), increased
market discounting for medium grade ores, and some
pricing adjustments for contract customers. Arrium has a
range of pricing arrangements with its contract
customers, some of which settle in subsequent
periods.Lower prices in the June quarter led to
adjustments for some prior period shipments. The
impact in the quarter of the prior period price
adjustments on Arrium’s average CFR price was US$2/t.
Excluding the impact of prior period adjustments,
Arrium’s Opal Blend and Whyalla Blend products, which
averaged ~60% Fe, achieved average prices for the
quarter of above 90% of the Platt 62% Fe index.

For the full year, Arrium’s average price was US$111/t
CFR (dmt), or ~91% of the average Platts 62% index
price. Arrium is continuing to broaden its customer base
in the North Asian region, both in and outside China.

Production and Shipping
Hematite ore mined for export in the Middleback
Ranges was 1,944k (wmt) for the quarter, up 20% on
the prior quarter. The higher output related to increased
mining at the Iron Chieftain.
Ore mined at Peculiar Knob in our Southern Iron
operation was 854k (wmt), down 18% compared to the
prior quarter. A significant rain deluge in April halted
mining and trucking for almost a week, resulting in the
loss of rail paths to Whyalla. However, increased supply
chain flexibility related to the recent expansion enabled
lost production from Southern Iron to be largely
supplemented with material from the Middleback region,
albeit at a slightly lower grade.
Ore shipments of 3,159k (dmt) for the quarter were 133k
(dmt) above ore shipments in the prior quarter. An
upgraded tug fleet was commissioned in May enabling
transhipping to cope with a broader range of operational
and weather conditions. The quarter also included a
number of Port records, including a record cape loading
rate of 3.9 days, and a record vessel lift of 201,160
(wmt) on the vessel MV Yuan Wang Hai. Utilising larger
vessels reduces sea freight on a $/t basis as it reduces
the number of vessels required.

Costs
Arrium Mining’s average cash cost loaded on the ship
(excluding royalties and depreciation) was A$45.9/wmt
for the quarter, A$1.5/wmt lower than for the prior
period. This was achieved partly through cost benefits at
the Middleback Ranges operation from increased
mining volumes, the utilisation of lower valued
stockpiled materials and improved efficiencies and cost
management processes. The average cost also reflects
a reduced proportion of higher cost Opal Blend in the
sales mix.

Page172of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Development
Iron Knob Mining Area
Arrium is continuing its re-development of the Iron Knob
Mining Area as part of its focus on utilising the
expanded port capability of ~13mtpa. The project
comprises three open cut mine pits (Monarch, Princess
East and Princess West). The project is continuing to
run to schedule and budget. The tender for the rail
reinstatement to the site was issued in March and
design work on the crushing plant circuit design is
continuing. The pit mining sequence is on plan and
drilling and blasting is also on schedule. First ores are
expected in the first half of FY15.

Magnetite Optimisation Project

This project includes the installation of a tertiary grinder
and modifications to the existing grinding circuit to allow
the concentrator to treat a wider range of ores, as well
as maximise product recovery through fine grinding
technology. The project benefits include additional
output (pellets, lump or concentrate) of ~400kt per
annum with reduced mining activity based on the
consumption of stockpiled materials. The construction
phase of the project was completed in November ahead
of schedule and budget. Focus is now on delivering
further operational benefits including increased output of
magnetite concentrate.

Exploration

Exploration activity continues to focus on:

• Adding to or extending the mine life of existing
operations to utilise the full capacity of the Whyalla Port

• Investigating further ferrous and non-ferrous
opportunities across the Middleback Ranges and
Southern
Iron tenements

Drilling activity in the June quarter totalled 13,867m. The
program included resource definition and extension
Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling and specialist
hydrogeological drilling. Up to four rigs were allocated to
the Hematite stream, with a strong focus on the
Middleback Ranges projects.

In the northern portion of the South Middleback Ranges
project area, resource definition and extension RC
drilling continued at Iron Chieftain. Drilling focussed on
inferred extensions to the mineralised envelope over a
700m long zone to the north of the Chieftain pit.
In the Iron Baron area, RC drilling commenced at
prospects adjacent to the Iron Queen pit. At Queen
Outlier, immediately to the south west of the Queen pit,
drilling commenced to test an area of ferruginous
material identified in outcrop during field mapping.
In the Iron Monarch area, RC drilling was carried out to
test the potential for mineralisation immediately to the
north of the Monarch pit and at Iron Princess. In
addition, hydrological drilling comprising pump testing

Page173of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.and analysis to support mine planning commenced at
Iron Princess.
In the Southern Iron project portfolio, resource definition
and extension RC drilling continued on the Hawks Nest
project at the Buzzard and Tui hematite prospects.
Drilling focussed particularly on new hematite targets to
the south west of Buzzard, identified by the high
resolution ground gravity survey completed in late 2013.
Beyond the immediate Buzzard-Tui area, a further
ground gravity survey was completed over all interpreted
prospective iron formation within the Hawks Nest
project area.

Drilling and assay results from these programs are being
progressively incorporated into the mine plan.

In addition, planning for further high resolution ground
gravity surveys to assist in targeting for both the ferrous
and non-ferrous programs was finalised in the
Middleback Ranges and the Southern Iron tenements. A
number of areas considered prospective for non-ferrous
opportunities related to the Gawler Craton Iron Oxide
Copper Gold mineralising event have been defined
across the project portfolio.

Alumina Ltd (ASE: AWC)

Alcoa Second Quarter Earnings Results
Alumina Limited notes Alcoa Inc’s (“Alcoa”) quarterly
earnings release and attaches it for reference. Relevant
market data to assist readers in understanding the
market, operational and commercial matters of Alcoa
World Alumina & Chemicals (“AWAC”) are also
attached.
Alumina Limited’s CEO Peter Wasow, commented,
“Margins for the alumina segment declined over the
second quarter from the first quarter predominately due
to a higher Australian dollar and Brazilian Real, the
timing of maintenance, and higher oil costs. Industry
conditions remained challenging due to long refining
positions in the Atlantic region and China as smelter
curtailments in those areas reduced demand.”
AWAC’s production of alumina was 3.9 million tonnes
for the second quarter.
Alumina Limited received capital and income
repayments from AWAC of $20 million in the second
quarter bringing the total receipts to $54 million for the
first half of this year. Alumina Limited’s capital
contributions to AWAC were $14 million during the
second quarter and $32 million for the first half.
Alumina Limited’s net debt was $134 million at the end
of June 2014.

Lightweight metals technology, engineering and
manufacturing leader Alcoa (NYSE:AA) today
announced that profits surged in the second quarter as
the Company’s portfolio transformation continues
accelerating. Alcoa is aggressively transforming its
portfolio by building out its value-add businesses to
capture profitable growth and by creating a lower cost,
very competitive commodity business.

In second quarter 2014, Alcoa reported net income of
$138 million, or $0.12 per share, which includes $78
million in special items largely tied to a previously
announced restructuring aimed at reducing the cost
base of the commodity business.

Page175of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Excluding the impact of special items, net income was
$216 million, or $0.18 per share, more than double
sequentially and nearly triple year-over-year.

“Our second quarter results prove Alcoa’s
transformation is in high gear,” said Klaus Kleinfeld,
Alcoa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are
taking the downstream business to new profitability
heights, capturing midstream demand as auto
lightweighting accelerates, while continuing to
relentlessly improve upstream performance. Our
strategy of building a lightweight multi-material
innovation powerhouse and a highly competitive
commodities business is driving compelling and
sustainable shareholder value.”

Second quarter 2014 revenues climbed sequentially to
$5.8 billion and held steady from the same period last
year. The sequential improvement resulted from
stronger volumes in the mid and downstream, improved
metal pricing, and higher energy sales.

All of Alcoa’s business segments were profitable during
the quarter. Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS),
the downstream business, achieved its best ever results,
delivering $204 million in after-tax operating income
(ATOI). The midstream business, Global Rolled
Products (GRP), continued to capture increasing
demand for automotive sheet. The upstream business,
comprising Alumina and Primary Metals, improved
performance for the 11th consecutive quarter. Primary
Metals’ results reflect a more competitive business, the
positive impact of energy sales, and higher regional
premiums due to robust aluminum demand.

Sequentially, second quarter 2014 results compare to a
net loss of $178 million, or $0.16 per share, in first
quarter 2014. Excluding special items, second quarter
2014 results compare to net income of $98 million, or
$0.09 per share, in the sequential period.

Year-over-year, second quarter 2014 results compare to
a net loss of $119 million, or $0.11 per share, in second
quarter 2013. Excluding special items, second quarter
2014 results compare to net income of $76 million, or
$0.07 per share, in the year-ago period.

Special items in second quarter 2014 included the
previously announced restructuring associated with the
closure of the Point Henry smelter in Australia and the
Australian rolling mills. There were also costs associated
with the Firth
Rixson acquisition agreement and the recently
completed U.S. labor contract negotiations.

Continued Growth Across End Markets

Alcoa continues to project 2014 global aerospace
growth of 8 to 9 percent driven by robust demand for
both large commercial aircraft and regional jets. The
Company’s projected 2014 automotive growth of 1 to 4
percent, packaging growth of 2 to 3 percent, and
building and construction growth of 4 to 6 percent,
remain unchanged. In the industrial gas turbine market,
the Company’s projected decline of 8 to 12 percent, on

Page176of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.lower orders for new gas turbines and spare parts, also
remains unchanged.

Alcoa increased its 2014 estimate for the North America
commercial transportation market to a range of 10 to 14
percent, from a previous range of 5 to 9 percent in the
first quarter. The higher estimate is based in part on
rising truck orders and backlogs. Globally, Alcoa
continues to expect a steady commercial transportation
market in 2014 of -1 to 3 percent due to weakness in the
European market.

Additionally, Alcoa reaffirmed its 7 percent global
aluminum demand growth projection for 2014.
For 2014, the Company sees a global aluminum deficit
of 930,000 metric tons, an increase from a deficit of
730,000 metric tons estimated in the first quarter. Alcoa
also sees a tightening of the alumina market with a
surplus declining from 2,257,000 metric tons in the first
quarter to 824,000 metric tons in second quarter 2014.

Value-Add Portfolio Transformation

Alcoa’s strategy to build out its value-add businesses
took a major step forward in the second quarter with the
signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Firth Rixson,
a global leader in aerospace jet engine components.
The $2.85 billion cash and stock acquisition will further
strengthen Alcoa’s robust aerospace portfolio,
positioning the Company to capture additional
aerospace growth with a broader range of multi-material,
value-add jet engine components.

Firth Rixson’s revenues are expected to grow 60 percent
over the next three years, from $1 billion in 2013 to
$1.6 billion, and contribute $350 million EBITDA in
2016. Firth Rixson’s sales are expected to grow 12
percent annually through 2019, a rate more than double
the expanding global aerospace market. Approximately
70 percent of Firth Rixson’s revenue growth is secured
by long-term agreements.

In the second quarter, Alcoa also announced two
organic investments in its Power and Propulsion (APP)
business in the EPS segment totaling $125 million to
meet increasing demand for next-generation jet engine
components. In La Porte, Indiana, Alcoa is investing
$100 million to build a new state-of-the-art
320,000-square-foot facility. It will expand Alcoa’s reach
in structural engine components for military, business
and regional jets to large commercial aircraft, including
narrow-and wide-body airplanes. In Hampton, Virginia,
Alcoa is scaling-up technology at an existing plant to cut
the weight of its highest-volume jet engine blades by 20
percent. The lighter blade will enhance aerodynamic
performance for increased fuel efficiency. Both
expansions are expected to be complete by fourth
quarter 2015 and will contribute towards APP’s expected
$2.2 billion revenues in 2016.

In Alcoa’s GRP segment, the automotive expansion in
Davenport, Iowa, is complete and will continue to ramp
up production in the third quarter to serve growing
demand for aluminum intensive vehicles. Alcoa’s second
automotive expansion in Tennessee is on schedule for
completion in mid 2015. The amount of aluminum body

Page177of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.sheet content in North American vehicles is expected to
quadruple by 2015 and increase tenfold by 2025 from
2012 levels. In addition, the rolling mill at the
Ma’aden-Alcoa joint venture in Saudi Arabia produced
its first production-grade coil on schedule.

Upstream Portfolio Transformation
The Company continues to execute previously
announced portfolio actions to lower the cost base of its
commodity business and take further decisive action to
optimize its portfolio.

In the second quarter, Alcoa completed the curtailment
of 147,000 metric tons of smelting capacity in Brazil at
São Luís (Alumar) and Poços de Caldas. In August,
Alcoa will permanently close the 190,000 metric ton
Point Henry aluminum smelter in Australia.

The Saudi Arabia joint venture is also integral to the
Company’s strategy of increasing the cost
competitiveness of its commodity portfolio. In the second
quarter, the start up of the Saudi Arabia smelter, the
lowest cost aluminum production facility in the world,
was completed.
To further optimize the Alumina business, Alcoa signed
a non-binding letter of intent to pursue a sale of its
ownership stake in Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica, L.L.C
(AMJ), which operates the Jamalco bauxite mining and
alumina refining joint venture. Jamalco is owned jointly
by AMJ (55%) and Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd.
(45%). AMJ is part of the Alcoa World Alumina &
Chemicals (AWAC) group of companies and is owned
60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Ltd. Clarendon
Alumina Production Ltd. is a company wholly owned by
the Government of Jamaica.
The above actions are consistent with the Company’s
goal of lowering its position on the world aluminum
production cost curve to the 38th percentile and the
alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile, by 2016.

Financial Performance

Alcoa continues to drive strong performance across all
businesses, delivering $302 million in second quarter
productivity gains across all segments and $556 million
in year-over-year productivity gains in the first half of
2014 against an $850 million annual target. Productivity
gains have been driven by process improvements and
procurement savings across all businesses. Alcoa
managed growth capital expenditures of $206 million
against a $500 million annual target and controlled
sustaining capital expenditures of $261 million against
a $750 million annual plan. Contributions in the Saudi
Arabia joint venture project were on track at $64 million
invested against a $125 million annual plan.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $260 million, with
cash from operations generating $518 million. Alcoa
ended the quarter with cash on hand of $1.2 billion, up
from $665 million in first quarter 2014.
The Company reported an average of 33 days working
capital for the quarter, up 4 days from second quarter
2013. The increase was primarily due to inventory build

Page178of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.to support automotive growth and third quarter 2014
sales expectations, as well as to fulfill stocking
requirements for both the recently-completed labor
negotiations and curtailments. Sequentially, average
days working capital was 3 days higher primarily due to
longer customer terms and inventory build to support the
automotive growth.

Alcoa’s net debt decreased sequentially from $7.1
billion to $6.9 billion in second quarter 2014, the lowest
since 2007. Alcoa’s debt totaled $8.1 billion. The
Company’s debt-to-capital ratio stood at 35.4 percent,
while net debt-to-capital ratio stood at 31.8 percent.

Segment Performance Engineered Products and
Solutions
ATOI was a quarterly record of $204 million, up $15
million, or 8 percent, sequentially and up $11 million,
or 6 percent, year-over-year. Sequentially, higher
volumes across all businesses and favorable
productivity drove the improvement. This segment
reported a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1
percent, compared to 22.2 percent for both first quarter
2014 and the same quarter last year.

Global Rolled Products
ATOI in the second quarter was $79 million compared
to $59 million in first quarter 2014, a 34 percent
improvement, and $79 million in second quarter 2013.
Sequentially, the improvement in ATOI was driven by
higher seasonal demand for can sheet and
strengthening orders for brazing sheet, industrial and
commercial transportation products due to recovering
economies in Europe and the United States, as well as
the absence of a first quarter charge related to the
planned permanent shutdown of the Australia rolling
operations. This segment also continues to capture
automotive demand. These favorable impacts were
partially offset by costs associated with recently
completed U.S. labor contract negotiations.
Alumina

ATOI in the second quarter was $38 million, down $54
million sequentially, and down $26 million
year-over-year. The decline in sequential ATOI was
primarily due to the first quarter benefit from the sale of
Alcoa’s Suriname gold mine interest, unfavorable
foreign exchange rates, lower Alumina Price Index
(API) pricing, and additional costs due to outages and
maintenance. Adjusted EBITDA per metric ton fell $10
from first quarter 2014 to $39 per metric ton in second
quarter 2014.

Primary Metals
ATOI in the second quarter was $97 million, up $112
million sequentially from negative $15 million, and up
$129 million from negative $32 million in second
quarter 2013. Third-party realized price in second
quarter 2014 was $2,291 per metric ton, up 4 percent
sequentially, and up 2 percent year-over-year.
Sequential results were driven by higher London Metal
Exchange (LME) pricing and regional premiums,
increased power sales, and the absence of special

Page179of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.charges recorded in the first quarter. Results were
partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
Adjusted EBITDA per metric ton was $337, $187 per
metric ton higher than first quarter 2014.

BHP Billiton Ltd (ASE: BHP)

Strong operating performance delivered a 9% increase
in Group production with annual records achieved
across 12 operations and four commodities.
Western Australia Iron Ore achieved a fourteenth
consecutive annual production record as volumes
increased to 225 Mt (100% basis), significantly
exceeding initial full-year guidance. We now expect
production of 245 Mt (100% basis) from the Pilbara in
the 2015 financial year.
Metallurgical coal production of 45 Mt exceeded
full-year guidance as Queensland Coal achieved record
production and sales volumes.
Copper production increased to 1.7 Mt as an
improvement in mill throughput and concentrator
utilisation offset grade decline at a number of
operations.

Petroleum production increased by 4% to a record 246
MMboe with an 18% increase in liquids volumes
underpinned by significant growth at Onshore US and
Atlantis.

Six major projects were completed and another two
projects achieved first production, including the Caval
Ridge coal mine which was completed ahead of
schedule and under budget in the June 2014 quarter.

BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Mackenzie,
said: “Our focus on productivity has resulted in a
significant improvement in operating performance at
each of our major businesses this year, with a nine per
cent1increase in Group production and record output at
12 operations. Western Australia Iron Ore and
Queensland Coal annual production exceeded
guidance, with both rising by more than 20 per cent as
we delivered more tonnes from existing infrastructure
and growth projects ahead of schedule. At Escondida,
an increase in mill throughput and concentrator
utilisation offset copper grade decline, while our
Onshore US business delivered a 73 per cent increase
in petroleum liquids production.

“We expect to maintain strong momentum and remain
on track to generate Group production growth of 16 per
cent1 over the two years to the end of the 2015 financial
year. In Petroleum, we are investing in our
highest-return acreage while a broader improvement in
productivity is expected to underpin stronger iron ore,
copper and metallurgical coal volumes. We will remain
focused on value over volume as we prioritise our
brownfield development options and consider the next
phase of portfolio simplification.”

Page180of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Strong operating performance in the 2014 financial year
delivered a nine per cent increase in Group production
as records were achieved across 12 operations and
four commodities. Group production growth of 16 per
cent is expected over the two years to the end of the
2015 financial year.
Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) significantly
exceeded initial full-year production guidance as the
early commissioning of Jimblebar and our productivity
agenda raised the capacity of our integrated supply
chain. The ramp-up of Jimblebar to 35 Mtpa (100 per
cent basis) is now expected before the end of the 2014
calendar year and will support a further 20 Mt increase
in WAIO production to approximately 245 Mt (100 per
cent basis) in the 2015 financial year. A low-cost option
to expand Jimblebar to 55 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) and
broader debottlenecking of the supply chain are
expected to underpin further growth in capacity towards
270 Mtpa (100 per cent basis).
Metallurgical coal production exceeded full-year
guidance as Queensland Coal achieved record
production and sales volumes. This included first
production from Caval Ridge, the successful ramp-up of
Daunia and record production at Peak Downs, Saraji,
South Walker Creek and Poitrel. Metallurgical coal
production is forecast to increase by four per cent in the
2015 financial year to 47 Mt as the ramp-up of Caval
Ridge is completed.
Escondida copper production increased by two per cent
as an improvement in mill throughput and concentrator
utilisation offset declining ore grades. With further
improvements in productivity anticipated, Escondida is
on track to produce approximately 1.27 Mt of copper in
the 2015 financial year, while Group copper production
is forecast to increase by five per cent to 1.8 Mt.
Energy coal volumes were broadly unchanged in the
2014 financial year as a fifth consecutive production
record at New South Wales Energy Coal and record
volumes at Cerrejón were offset by lower production at
South Africa Energy Coal and Navajo Coal. Energy
coal production for the 2015 financial year is expected
to remain broadly unchanged at 73 Mt.

Petroleum production of 246 MMboe marginally
exceeded revised full-year guidance as liquids volumes
in our Onshore US business increased by 23 per cent in
the June 2014 quarter. Petroleum production is forecast
to increase by five per cent in the 2015 financial year to
255 MMboe with high-margin liquids volumes expected
to increase by 16 MMboe. We remain confident that
Onshore US will be strongly EBIT positive in the 2015
financial year as the liquids contribution is forecast to
rise to approximately 40 per cent of total shale
production.

Major development projects

At the end of the 2014 financial year, BHP Billiton had
eight low-risk, largely brownfield major projects under
development with a combined budget of US$14.1 billion.

During the 2014 financial year we successfully
completed six projects, namely: Macedon; North West

Page181of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Shelf North Rankin B Gas Compression; WAIO
Jimblebar Mine Expansion; WAIO Port Blending and
Rail Yard Facilities; Samarco Fourth Pellet Plant; and
Caval Ridge. Caval Ridge was completed in the June
2014 quarter, ahead of schedule and under budget, and
will not be reported in future Operational Reviews.
Another two projects, Newcastle Third Port Stage 3 and
Cerrejón P40, delivered first coal during the year.
A US$212 million increase in the budget of the
Escondida Oxide Leach Area project to US$933 million
has been approved. The project is now expected to be
completed in the second half of the 2014 calendar year
with no associated impact to production.

Corporate update

BHP Billiton expects Underlying EBIT in the June 2014
half year to include additional charges in a range of
approximately US$0.9 billion to US$1.3 billion related
to: impairments and mine site rehabilitation; and
redundancies and the closure of operations associated
with our productivity agenda. Items include impairments
(related to the Port of Vancouver and small Gulf of
Mexico petroleum assets) and mine site rehabilitation
costs in Petroleum and Potash, and the impairment of
assets at South Africa Energy Coal. Redundancy costs
will be recognised in our Coal, Iron Ore and Aluminium,
Manganese and Nickel Businesses, while additional
costs will be recognised following the closure of
aluminium smelting activities at Bayside. This guidance
will be updated should material information or events
arise as the Company finalises its financial statements.

We continued to simplify our portfolio during the 2014
financial year with the successful completion of
numerous transactions, including Jimblebar and Pinto
Valley. In the last two years alone, the Group has
completed transactions exceeding US$6.7 billion in
Australia, the United States, Canada, South Africa and
the United Kingdom, including petroleum, copper, iron
ore, coal, mineral sands, uranium and diamonds
assets. We continue to actively study the next phase of
simplification, including structural options, but we will
only pursue options that maximise value for BHP Billiton
shareholders.

Marketing update

The average realised prices achieved for our major
commodities are summarised in the table below. Iron
ore shipments, on average, were linked to the index
price for the month of shipment, with price differentials
reflecting product quality. The majority of metallurgical
coal and energy coal exports were linked to the index
price for the month of shipment or sold on the spot
market, with price differentials reflecting product quality.

Total petroleum production – Petroleum production
increased by four per cent in the 2014 financial year to
246 MMboe and included strong performance from
Onshore US, which delivered a 73 per cent increase in
liquids volumes. Petroleum production is forecast to
increase by five per cent in the 2015 financial year to
255 MMboe as continued growth at Onshore US
contributes to a 16 MMboe increase in total liquids
production. Conventional volumes for the 2015 financial

Page182of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.year are forecast to remain broadly unchanged,
consistent with prior guidance.
Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids – Crude
oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production
increased by 18 per cent in the 2014 financial year to
106 MMboe. Onshore US liquids production increased
by 23 per cent in the June 2014 quarter and we expect
to carry strong momentum into the 2015 financial year
as shale liquids volumes are forecast to increase by
over 17 MMboe in the period. We remain confident that
Onshore US will be strongly EBIT positive in the 2015
financial year as the liquids contribution is forecast to
rise to approximately 40 per cent of total shale
production.

In our conventional business, a near doubling of
production at Atlantis was achieved ahead of prior
guidance as the early completion of two production wells
brought forward volumes into the 2014 financial year.
While production at Pyrenees declined by 12 per cent as
a result of major maintenance, volumes recovered
strongly in the second half ofthe financial year following
the completion of five new production wells.

Natural gas – Natural gas production declined by four
per cent in the 2014 financial year to 839 bcf. The
delivery of first gas from Macedon partially offset lower
demand at Bass Strait and natural field decline at
Haynesville.
Copper – Total copper production increased by two per
cent in the 2014 financial year to 1.7 Mt as planned.
Total copper production is forecast to increase by five
per cent in the 2015 financial year to 1.8 Mt.
Escondida copper production increased by two per cent
in the 2014 financial year to 1.2 Mt as an improvement
in mill throughput and concentrator utilisation offset
declining ore grades. With further improvements in
productivity anticipated, Escondida is on track to
produce approximately 1.27 Mt of copper in the 2015
financial year. A power outage throughout Northern
Chile in July 2014 and a six-day maintenance shutdown
at the Laguna Seca concentrator will impact production
in the September 2014 quarter. Commissioning of
Organic Growth Project 1 is scheduled for the June
2015 quarter.
Pampa Norte copper production of 233 kt for the 2014
financial year was unchanged from the prior period.
Production is forecast to remain at a similar level in the
2015 financial year as higher grades and recoveries at
Spence offset declining grades and recoveries at Cerro
Colorado. A 12-day maintenance shutdown at Cerro
Colorado and tertiary crusher maintenance at Spence is
expected to impact production in the September 2014
quarter.
Record mining rates at Olympic Dam underpinned an
11 per cent increase in copper production in the 2014
financial year to 184 kt. While an annualised production
rate of 219 kt in the June 2014 quarter indicates the
degree of improvement achieved in the existing
underground operation, volumes in the 2015 financial
year are expected to remain broadly unchanged as a
result of the current smelter maintenance program which

Page183of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.is expected to be completed early in the September
2014 quarter. A major smelter maintenance campaign is
scheduled to commence in the June 2015 quarter.

Antamina achieved records for mill throughput and
copper production in the 2014 financial year. Average
copper grades at Antamina in the 2015 financial year
are expected to remain at a similar level to the June
2014 quarter, leading to lower copper production,
consistent with the mine plan.
Lead/silver – Lead and silver production decreased by
12 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, in the 2014
financial year as lower average ore grades at
Cannington were partially offset by a record mining
rate.

Zinc – Total zinc production decreased by 14 per cent in
the 2014 financial year and reflected lower grades at
Antamina, consistent with the mine plan.
Uranium – The production of uranium oxide
concentrate was broadly unchanged in the 2014
financial year.
Iron ore – Iron ore production increased by 20 per cent
in the 2014 financial year to a record 204 Mt, exceeding
initial full-year guidance by more than eight per cent.
Total iron ore production is forecast to increase by 11
per cent in the 2015 financial year to 225 Mt.
Western Australia Iron Ore production of 225 Mt (100
per cent basis) represents a fourteenth consecutive
annual record and was underpinned by the early
commissioning of Jimblebar and our productivity
agenda, which raised the capacity of our integrated
supply chain. Production from the Wheelarra Joint
Venture, which was previously processed through
Newman, was permanently connected to the Jimblebar
processing hub during the period. The spare capacity
created at Newman is now being utilised by existing
operations. The ramp-up of Jimblebar to 35 Mtpa (100
per cent basis) is now expected before the end of the
2014 calendar year.

In the 2015 financial year WAIO production is expected
to increase by a further 20 Mt to approximately 245 Mt
(100 per cent basis). Yet another year of record
performance will be supported by additional productivity
gains despite the tie-in of shiploaders 1 and 2 during the
period. A low-cost option to expand Jimblebar to 55
Mtpa (100 per cent basis) and broader debottlenecking
of the supply chain are expected to underpin further
growth in capacity towards 270 Mtpa (100 per cent
basis).

Samarco production of 22 Mt (100 per cent basis) was
broadly unchanged in the 2014 financial year. The fourth
pellet plant was commissioned in the March 2014
quarter and the ramp-up to 30.5 Mtpa (100 per cent
basis) is expected before the end of the 2015 financial
year.

Major increase in Mineral Resource at Western Australia
Iron Ore

Page184of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.BHP Billiton also confirms a 13 per cent increase in the
Mineral Resource at WAIO compared to the previous 30
June 2013 estimate (Table 2). The increase reflects the
inclusion of 500 km of infill drilling and revised resource
estimates that have continued to delineate orebodies
primarily with Brockman (67 per cent of the increase)
and Marra Mamba (33 per cent of the increase) ore
types, with changes after consideration of mining
depletion in the 2014 financial year. BHP Billiton
ownership averages 88 per cent but varies between 85
per cent and 100 per cent. Information pertaining to the
orebodies that contribute to the increase in Mineral
Resource is contained in Appendix 1.

WAIO is located within the Pilbara region of Western
Australia. The geology of the region, comprising the
Hamersley and North East Pilbara Provinces, has been
extensively studied and is well documented based on
extensive mapping, exploratory drilling and mining. The
Hamersley Group forms the central part of the Mt Bruce
Supergroup and contains two iron bearing stratigraphic
sequences, with major bedded ores hosted by the
Brockman Iron Formation and Marra Mamba Iron
Formation. The Nimingarra Iron Formation in the North
East Pilbara, hosts the Yarrie-Nimingarra iron ore
deposits. Another important iron bearing sequence is
the Marillana Formation which is a detrital derived
Channel Iron Deposit currently mined at Yandi.
WAIO Mineral Resources contain the ore types: BKM –
Brockman, CID – Channel Iron Deposits, MM – Marra
Mamba and NIM – Nimingarra.

Mineral Resource estimates are largely based upon
three metre samples obtained from 140 millimetre
Reverse Circulation (RC) drill holes and to a lesser
extent 0.3 metre to three metre samples obtained from
HQ3 and PQ3 type Diamond Drill holes and three metre
samples obtained from 140 millimetre open Percussion
holes.

RC and Percussion samples are either riffle or static
cone split whereas diamond core is typically sampled as
a whole. Samples are crushed to 90 per cent minus 2.8
millimetres and then pulverised to 95 per cent minus
0.16 millimetres. Pulp (200 grams) is then used for
chemical analysis by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) for Fe,
SiO2, Al2O3, P, MnO, CaO, K2O, MgO, S and TiO2 and
Robotic Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (ROBTGA) for
Loss on Ignition (LOI).

Resource estimation is typically performed by Ordinary
Kriging (OK) interpolation which uses search criteria
consistent with geostatistical models separately
developed for both Fe and associated deleterious
elements such as SiO2, Al2O3 and P according to the
appropriate geological controls. To a lesser extent some
deposits contributing Inferred Resources have been
estimated using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)
interpolation or Cross Sectional Area of Influence
techniques reflecting data density.
Metallurgical coal – Metallurgical coal production
increased by 20 per cent in the 2014 financial year to a
record

Page185of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.45 Mt, exceeding full-year guidance. Metallurgical coal
production is forecast to increase by four per cent in the

2015 financial year to 47 Mt as the ramp-up of Caval
Ridge is completed.
Queensland Coal achieved record production and sales
volumes in the 2014 financial year, supported by strong
performance across all operations. This included first
production from Caval Ridge, the successful ramp-up of
Daunia and record production at Peak Downs, Saraji,
South Walker Creek and Poitrel. A sustainable increase
in truck and wash-plant utilisation rates underpinned a
further improvement in productivity across the business.
Illawarra Coal production declined by five per cent in the
2014 financial year to 7.5 Mt. An extended outage at the
Dendrobium mine impacted performance, primarily in
the September 2013 quarter.
As a result of continued weakness in coal prices,
persistent strength of the Australian dollar and the
recognition of redundancy and restructuring charges,
Queensland Coal was marginally EBIT positive during
the second half of the 2014 financial year.
Energy coal – Energy coal production of 73 Mt in the
2014 financial year was broadly unchanged from the
prior period as planned. Another year of robust
performance was underpinned by a fifth consecutive
annual production record at New South Wales Energy
Coal and record volumes at Cerrejón. Extended outages
at both a local utility and the Richards Bay Coal
Terminal led to lower production at South Africa Energy
Coal, while Navajo Coal production declined following
the permanent closure of three of the five power units at
the Four Corners Power Plant.
Energy coal production for the 2015 financial year is
expected to remain broadly unchanged at 73 Mt. A
drought in the La Guajira region of Colombia is expected
to constrain Cerrejón production for the remainder of the
2014 calendar year given the requirement to manage
dust emissions. The port expansion associated with the
Cerrejón P40 project is currently being commissioned,
although operational issues are expected to constrain
capacity at approximately 35 Mtpa (100 per cent basis)
in the medium term.
Alumina – Alumina production increased by six per
cent in the 2014 financial year to a record 5.2 Mt. The

Efficiency and Growth project at Worsley reached
nameplate capacity during the year and annual
production records were achieved at both the Worsley
and Alumar refineries.

Aluminium – Aluminium production in the 2014 financial
year was unchanged at 1.2 Mt. Production records at
both Hillside and Mozal were offset by lower volumes at
Alumar following the phased suspension of 103 kt (BHP
Billiton share) of annualised capacity during the 2014
financial year. The final potline at Bayside was closed in
June 2014, although the cast house will be supplied by
our Hillside smelter as we continue to assess its future.

Page186of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Manganese ores – Despite achieving record production
in the June 2014 quarter, manganese ore volumes
declined by three per cent in the 2014 financial year as
GEMCO was affected by higher than usual rainfall
during the wet season.

Manganese alloys – Manganese alloy production
increased by six per cent from the 2013 financial year
which was affected by the temporary suspension of
operations at TEMCO.

Nickel – Nickel production declined by seven per cent in
the 2014 financial year to 143 kt as production at Cerro
Matoso was affected by kiln and furnace outages, and
lower nickel grades. Nickel West production declined by
four per cent following the closure of the Perseverance
underground mine in November 2013.

Saleable nickel production at Nickel West is expected to
decline by four per cent in the 2015 financial year to 95
kt. Ferro-nickel production at Cerro Matoso is expected
to decline by three per cent to 43 kt as a result of lower
grades and recoveries.

On 14 May 2014, BHP Billiton announced a review of
the Nickel West business, comprising the Mt Keith, Cliffs
and Leinster mines, its concentrators, the Kalgoorlie
smelter and the Kwinana refinery. The review is
considering all options for the long-term future of Nickel
West, including the potential sale of all or part of the
business.

For the period ending 30 June 2014

Successful ramp-up of the Kings Valley project delivered
the targeted 155 million tonne annualised run rate in
the June 2014 quarter and a record 160 million tonnes
annualised shipping rate for the month of June.

Fortescue remains absolutely focused on continuing to
improve shareholder value through identificationof
additional operating efficiencies and disciplined capital
management.
• Record shipments of 38.7 million tonnes (mt)
achieved during the June 2014 quarter

• Total FY14 shipments were 124.2mt, 53 per cent
greater than the prior financial year and within two per
cent of full year guidance of 127mt

• C1 costs for the June 2014 quarter were US$34.03/wet
metric tonne (wmt) bringing full year C1 cost to
US$33.84/wmt, a reduction of 23 per cent compared to
the prior financial year and below guidance

• Delivered cost to customers was US$49/wmt
(US$53/dmt) for the June 2014 quarter inclusive of C1,
shipping, royalties and administration

• CFR prices realised for the June 2014 quarter were
US$82/dry metric tonne (dmt) based on an average 62%
Platts CFR index of US$103/dmt
• Cash on hand was US$2.4 billion at 30 June 2014
reflecting the continued strength of operational
cashflows, reduced capital expenditure and lower
finance costs

Safety

Fortescue has taken decisive actions to reinforce that
safety is the highest priority for everyone on a Fortescue
site. The drive towards world class performance in
safety continued during the June 2014 quarter with the
Safety Excellence project focusing on enhancing safety
leadership. The project is delivering results with
improvements to safety outcomes among contracting
partners and the sharing of incident lessons.
The total recordable injury frequency rate per million
hours worked was 6.0 in the June 2014 quarter, a five
per cent improvement over the previous quarter and 21
per cent lower than the prior comparable period.

Aboriginal Engagement

Fortescue’s vision to create partnerships which deliver
lasting benefits to Aboriginal Communities through the
provision of training, employment and economic
development opportunities continued in FY14 with a
number of significant achievements.

In the June 2014 quarter, contracts and sub-contracts
valued at A$40 million were awarded to Aboriginal
businesses and joint ventures, bringing the total
awarded contracts value to A$497 million in FY14 and
the total value under the Billion Opportunities program
to A$1.58 billion. There was also a significant increase
in the commitment of Fortescue’s contracting partners to
provide second tier contract opportunities, with
sub-contracts worth A$233 million awarded to
Aboriginal businesses and joint ventures in FY14.

In FY14, Fortescue’s Vocational Training and
Employment Centres (VTECs) trained and provided jobs
for 122 people. Aboriginal people represent more than
12 per cent of Fortescue’s direct workforce and over
1,100 Aboriginal people are employed through our
operations.
Mining, Processing and Shipping

The June 2014 quarter delivered a seventh consecutive
shipping record with 38.7mt of ore shipped, a 23 per
cent increase over the previous quarter and a 55 per
cent increase over the prior comparable period.
Shipments included 37.6 million Fortescue equity
tonnes and 1.1 million third party tonnes.

During the June 2014 quarter, Fortescue mined 43.8mt
of ore, 48 per cent higher than the previous quarter.
This increase was largely due to the combination of
increased performance in operations through efficiency
initiatives as well as the continuity of work achieved
through the dry season. Ore mined in the June 2014
quarter was 28 per cent higher than the prior
comparable period. Fortescue drew down ROM iron ore
stocks by six per cent in the June 2014 quarter and aims
to continue reductions in the September 2014 quarter.

Strip ratios at the Chichester Hub averaged 3.2 for the
June 2014 quarter, slightly below the five year mine plan

Page189of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.of 3.5 due to the nature of the mining areas. The strip
ratio across the Solomon Hub was 1.3 during the June
2014 quarter as mining moved closer to a steady state,
following the ramp up of operations at the Kings Valley
project.
The operation of the Kings Valley Ore Processing
Facility (OPF) through the June 2014 quarter lifted
Fortescue’s production capacity beyond 155 million
tonnes per annum (mtpa). Fortescue’s total output from
all processing facilities increased to a record 41.1mt in
the June 2014 quarter, 32 per cent higher than the prior
quarter and work continues allowing transition to our
steady state product mix. During the June 2014 quarter
the Kings Valley OPF has been used to process detrital
ore overlying the main Kings CID ore. Kings CID has
now commenced to form a core product and provide the
planned product mix grades.

MARKETING
The key iron ore pricing references applicable to major
Australian producers are the 62% Platts and MBIO 58%
indices. These indices are essentially determined by
reference to the spot market created by the sales price
achieved for Rio Tinto’s Pilbara Blend, BHP’s MAC and
Newman Fines (62% Platts), and BHP’s Yandi (MBIO
58% + Premium).
Fortescue’s suite of products is sold with reference to
the 62% Platts index with a market price comparable to
other products which have similar value-in-use
properties for steel production.

The graph below sets out price relativities between the
62% Platts index, Fortescue Blend, Fortescue Super
Special Fines, Metal Bulletin 58% Premium index and
the Metal Bulletin 58% index. The graph shows that
while there have been variations in prices across the
year, Fortescue’s major products have consistently
priced in line with similar products relative to the 62%
Platts index.
Over the June 2014 quarter iron ore prices have traded
lower and at a wider spread which has historically been
the case in a low price environment. This reflects the
significant increase in new seabourne iron ore supply,
tighter credit conditions in China and relatively high
Chinese port stocks. During the June 2014 quarter iron
ore prices have been volatile resulting in a price
realisation of 80 per cent compared to the average 62%
Platts index. In FY14 Fortescue’s average price
realisation was 86 per cent compared to the average
62% Platts index.

Fortescue expects supply to re-balance in the short term
as port inventories are drawn down, steel mills re-stock
and higher cost iron ore production leaves the market.
As this occurs and Fortescue transitions to a product
suite dominated by the high quality Fortescue Blend and
Kings CID products, realised prices are expected to
range between 85 and 90 per cent of the 62% Platts
price index going forwards.

Balance Sheet

Page190of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Fortescue’s net debt position at 30 June 2014 was
US$7.2 billion, including finance leases of US$0.3
billion and cash on hand of US$2.4 billion.

Fortescue’s flexible debt profile facilitates additional
repayments and the ability to deliver on the strategy to
further debt reduction and move towards an initial
targeted gearing level of 40 per cent.

As noted in the debt maturity profile below Fortescue’s
earliest debt maturity is in 2017. Further, a total of
US$5.8 billion, or in excess of 60 per cent, of the
company’s long term debt is available for voluntary
repayment in advance of maturity and at Fortescue’s
option.

Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure in FY14 was US$1.9 billion, slightly
below guidance due to the deferral of approximately
US$100 million into FY15. As a result, FY15
expenditure is now estimated to be US$1.3 billion,
excluding any capital expenditure associated with the
Iron Bridge joint venture, which is fully funded by the
Formosa Plastics Group.

All T155 expansion projects have been completed and
US$9.2 billion was capitalised during FY14. Based on
the current fixed asset base, Fortescue estimates its
depreciation and amortisation expenditure to be
US$8.50/wmt shipped.

Ship Construction

Fortescue has entered into arrangements for the
construction of four highly efficient very large ore
carriers (VLOCs) for a total investment value of US$275
million. Construction is expected to commence in the
second half of 2014 and delivery is scheduled for
November 2016 through to May 2017 with the majority
of payments due on delivery.

In addition, advanced negotiations are underway to
secure four additional VLOCs with another major
Chinese ship builder. These ships are expected to be
delivered in late 2017 and early 2018 with the majority of
payments also due on delivery.

Fortescue’s shipping strategy is to lock in construction of
these VLOCs which are being designed to complement
the port infrastructure to improve load rates, efficiencies
and reduce operating costs. Flexibility has been built
into the ownership structure of these VLOCs which will
allow Fortescue to explore alternative financing
structures at a later date. The investment will initially be
funded by existing operating cash flows and due to the
timing of cash payments, is not expected to impact
Fortescue’s debt repayment strategy.

Fortescue expects the operating cost of these vessels to
be well below the current forward market rates for large
capesize vessels. This, together with expected
through-put benefits and operational savings at the port,
support the investment in these vessels.

Key Features of Results
 Iluka reported a net profit after tax of $11.7 million
for the half year ended 30 June 2014, compared with
$34.3 million for the previous corresponding period.

 Compared with the previous corresponding period,
the reduced earnings reflect, in the main, lower received
prices for key products, as well as a lower contribution
from the Mining Area C iron ore royalty.
 Free cash flow of $63.9 million was generated in the
first half. This is $108.4 million higher than the previous
corresponding period (2013: -$44.5 million), reflecting a
$107.1 million reduction in tax payments. In 2013, tax
payments of $118.4 million were paid in respect of
2012 earnings.

 Mineral Sands revenue for the first half of 2014 was
$343.2 million compared with $381.7 million in the
previous corresponding period.

 Combined zircon, rutile and synthetic rutile (Z/R/SR)
sales volumes in the first half of 2014 were 3.5 per cent
lower at 277.1 thousand tonnes compared to 287.2
thousand tonnes in 2013.

 Key product prices received were 13.8 per cent lower
period-on-period with first half revenue per tonne of
Z/R/SR of $1,015 per tonne compared with $1,178 per
tonne in the first half of 2013, reflecting materially lower
high grade titanium dioxide prices received period on
period.
 Cash costs of production of $200.7 million were in
line with the previous corresponding period (2013:
$201.9 million). Cash costs of production include $19.8
million of costs in relation to ilmenite concentrate and
by-product costs (2013: $11.9 million). Iluka’s
year-to-date cash costs of production are trending in line
with guidance of ~$430 million for the full year, of which
~$365 million relates to zircon and rutile production
costs and ~$65 million relates to by-product costs (refer
ASX Release, Key Physical & Financial Parameters, 21
February 2014).

Page192of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved. On a unit basis, cash costs of production were $796
per tonne of Z/R/SR, a 6.1 per cent decrease compared
with the previous corresponding period, reflecting 5.9
per cent higher production of Z/R/SR. Excluding the
costs for ilmenite concentrate and by-products, the unit
cash cost of production was $718 per tonne of Z/R/SR,
compared with $798 per tonne in the previous
corresponding period.

 The reduction in underlying unit costs reflects the
cost savings realised in 2014 from the operational
adjustments that were undertaken in the previous
corresponding period, including reductions in workforce
and idling some assets.

 Mineral sands EBITDA for the first half of 2014 was
$107.9 million, a 21.0 per cent decrease compared with
the previous corresponding period. Mineral sands EBIT
decreased by 63.5 per cent to $13.8 million (2013:
$37.8 million).
 Mining Area C iron ore royalty earnings (MAC)
decreased by 16.3 per cent to $38.0 million (2013:
$45.4 million), including capacity payments of $1
million (2013: $4.0 million). This mainly reflects lower
received iron ore prices period-on-period.
 Group EBIT was $31.5 million, a decrease of 48.5
per cent compared to $61.2 million in the previous
corresponding period.

 Inventory of finished product decreased by $25.8
million to $376.2 million as sales of Z/R/SR during the
period exceeded production by 25.0 thousand tonnes
combined with a $3.5 million reduction in ilmenite
inventory. Work in progress inventory increased by
$47.4 million as heavy mineral concentrate (HMC)
production of 676.3 thousand tonnes exceeded HMC
processed of 480.2 thousand tonnes, consistent with the
strategy of maintaining cost efficient mining operations
at Jacinth-Ambrosia and Woornack, Rownack, Pirro
(WRP) while restricting production of finished product.
 Capital expenditure of $42.2 million was incurred in
the half year, of which $18.6 million was for an 18.3 per
cent equity interest in Metalysis Limited. Other
expenditure related to various major project evaluation
work. Iluka’s year-to-date capital expenditure compares
to full year guidance of ~$110 million.
Net debt at 30 June 2014 was $155.2 million, with a
gearing ratio (net debt/net debt + equity) of 9.2 per cent.
This compares with net debt at 31 December 2013 of
$206.6 million and a gearing ratio of 11.8 per cent.
During the period, Iluka has extended the maturity of
$625.0 million of the $800.0 million credit facilities
under the Multi Option Facility Agreement (MOFA) from
April 2017 to April 2019 and also increased the size of
the facilities by $50.0 million to $850.0 million through
the addition of a new bilateral facility to April 2019. As a
result, Iluka has facilities of $175.0 million maturing in
April 2017 and $675.0 million maturing in April 2019.

 Undrawn facilities at 30 June 2014 were $676.0
million and cash at bank was $34.0 million. Net debt at
31 July 2014 was $139.1 million

Page193of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Dividend

Directors have determined an interim dividend of 6.0
cents per share, fully franked. The dividend is payable
on 3 October 2014 for shareholders on the register as at
5 September 2014. This dividend compares with a 2013
interim dividend of 5.0 cents (fully franked).

Market Conditions

Zircon
As commented on previously by the company, zircon
market conditions vary across countries and end
segments. North American and China demand has
been relatively robust, with the major part of Iluka’s
year-to-date sales of 146 thousand tonnes being made
in these two markets. China sentiment in the ceramics
sector remained positive, while demand in the chemicals
sector improved. North American zircon demand
continues to be supported by industrial and
manufacturing applications, where the trends and
underlying data continue to be favourable.

Demand in Europe has been very subdued, although
some emerging signs of recovery became apparent
during the latter part of the June quarter, based on
demand from the export markets, such as the Middle
East and Brazil, supplied by European ceramics
producers. Sales to other markets, including South East
Asia, Japan and India continued to be subdued.

While sales year-to-date, including July sales, are
trending in line with Iluka’s expectations, first half sales
in 2014 were lower than the previous corresponding
period. As Iluka advised at the time of its May 2014
Annual General Meeting, in the first half of 2013 broad
based zircon price increases were communicated to
customers which prompted some increased ordering of
zircon in that period. Iluka expects second half 2014
zircon sales volumes to be greater than the second half
of 2013 (2H 2013: 160 thousand tonnes; full year 2013:
370 thousand tonnes).

There has been no material change in the previously
advised weighted average zircon price received by the
company from that advised as achieved in the
December quarter 2013 of US$1,080/tonne FOB.

Titanium Dioxide

A recovery in high grade feedstock requirements,
particularly in the chloride pigment sector, is apparent as
downstream inventories and pigment plant utilisation
rates appear to be normalising, based on generally
healthy demand trends in North American and European
pigment and paint markets.
Iluka’s rutile sales reflect in part the company’s
continued margin optimization approach under current
market conditions, as well as a view on longer term
realised value considerations pertaining to the timing of
sales through the current cyclical recovery. This is
influenced by an expectation that global rutile supply will
diminish in 2015 coinciding with Iluka completing mining
at the Woornack, Rownack, Pirro mine in the Murray
Basin, Victoria.

Page194of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Under this situation of potentially constrained supply of
rutile, the company will be seeking to support
customers through allocated sales of finished goods
inventory and via processing of heavy mineral
concentrate built in the Murray Basin over the balance of
2014, resulting in the rutile sales profile in 2014 being
first half weighted.

As noted previously, Iluka has observed a stabilisation in
received weighted average rutile prices.

Iluka advised in its February 2014 guidance that it
expects that total zircon/rutile/synthetic rutile sales may
exceed production (~550 thousand tonnes) and also be
above 2013 sales levels (584 thousand tonnes).

Projects

Iluka recommenced supply of synthetic rutile to some
customers in the first half and expects a gradual
recovery of demand for this product. Given product is
being drawn from inventory in the absence of any
synthetic rutile production in 2014, subject to suitable
commercial arrangements, a basis for reactivation of a
synthetic rutile kiln may be emerging.

Consistent with Iluka’s overall approach to shareholder
returns through the cycle, the company will determine
the appropriateness of the timing for all its current
projects – in Australia and in the United States of
America – based on prevailing and forecast market
demand conditions, timely and satisfactory completion of
feasibility studies and resultant project economics.

Newcrest Mining Ltd (ASE: NCM)

Full Year Financial Results
Today Newcrest Mining Limited released its Annual
Financial Report for the twelve months ended 30 June
2014. This market release is a summary document and
readers are directed to the full text of the release. This
market release contains non-IFRS financial information
that is not subject to external audit. For definitions,
reconciliations and rationale of use of the non-IFRS
information refer to the notes on pages 5 to 7. See also
the disclaimer in note 7 on page 8 regarding forward
looking statements.

Key points
 Statutory loss1 of A$2,221 million and Underlying
profit2 of A$432 million

 Significant items representing a net loss after tax of
A$2,653 million, due primarily to A$2,353 million of
asset impairments at Lihir, Telfer, Bonikro and Hidden
Valley
 EBITDA2 of A$1,514 million and EBIT2 of A$821
million

 Gold production of 2,396,023 ounces and gold sales
of 2,405,163 ounces was 14% and 17% higher than the
prior year
 Free cash flow2 was an inflow of A$133 million
compared with a net outflow of A$1,417 in the prior year,
with all operations free cash flow positive in the current
year except Hidden Valley

 Cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of
A$1,037 million

Page196of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved. All-In Sustaining Cost2 of A$976 per ounce (US$897
per ounce at an A$:US$ exchange rate of $0.9187) was
24% (32%) lower than the prior year

 Gearing3 of 33.8% at 30 June 2014
 A$1,808 million4 in cash and undrawn, committed
bank facilities at 30 June 2014

 No dividend for the twelve months ended 30 June
2014

Newcrest Chief Executive Officer, Sandeep Biswas said:
“The Company’s improved operating performance in
FY14 shows progress in productivity improvements and
cost reductions. These initial improvements enabled the
company to maintain its underlying profit2 and profit
margins notwithstanding a lower gold price, and deliver
free cash flow2 of $133 million for the year.”
“Asset value impairments of $2.4 billion after tax were
the major drivers of a statutory loss for the year of $2.2
billion. The most significant component of the write
downs related to Lihir,” he said.

“While we have realised some initial operating
improvements, I am not satisfied with either the current
operating performance or the cash generation of the
business.”
“Looking ahead, the Company is firmly focused on
realising the potential of its assets. A Company-wide
improvement program has been initiated, which includes
a major review at Lihir. We expect Group production
this year to be similar to that in financial year 2014 as
we ramp up Cadia East and make improvements at Lihir
which will lay the foundations for future production
growth,” Mr Biswas said.

Full year results

Newcrest’s operating and financial performance for the
twelve months ended 30 June 2014 reflects the
Company’s focus on improving productivity, reducing
costs and capital expenditure and maximising free cash
flow2 while maintaining growth options.
Increased gold and copper production and free cash
flow2 generation in the 2014 financial year follows major
expansion investments at Cadia Valley and Lihir,
improved operating performance across all operations,
and a reduction in All-In Sustaining Cost2 expenditure.
Newcrest’s 2014 financial year gold production of 2.4
million ounces exceeded guidance of 2.0 to 2.3 million
ounces. Full year copper production of 86 thousand
tonnes also exceeded guidance of 75 to 85 thousand
tonnes. Total capital expenditure in the 2014 financial
year of A$843 million, All-In Sustaining Cost2
expenditure of A$2.33 billion and exploration
expenditure of A$62 million were also below their
guidance of A$895 to A$1,025 million, A$2.45 to
A$2.73 billion and A$80 to A$90 million, respectively.
Statutory loss1 for the current year was A$2,221 million
(compared with a prior year statutory loss of A$5,783
million), including significant items after tax totalling
A$2,653 million. The significant items comprise asset
impairments of A$2,353 million, an additional income

Page197of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.tax expense for the period of A$120 million as a result
of the voluntary amendment of research and
development claims6 in prior periods, restructure costs
of A$34 million and A$146 million in write downs of
inventory, property, plant and equipment at Lihir and
Cadia Valley.

The asset impairments were primarily a result of
Newcrest’s review of physical, cost, capital and
economic assumptions applied in the valuation of
Newcrest’s assets as at 30 June 2014. The outcome of
this review, and total asset impairments of A$2,353
million, primarily reflects applying updated operating
and capital cost assumptions at Lihir, Bonikro and
Hidden Valley, and the impact of applying updated
foreign exchange assumptions at Telfer.

Underlying profit2 for the twelve months ended 30 June
2014 was A$432 million (prior year A$446 million) and
primarily reflects the impact of a 9% lower average
realised gold price partially offset by a 17% increase in
gold sales volumes.
EBITDA2 of A$1,514 million and EBIT2 of A$821
million for the current year represent EBITDA
margins2and EBIT margins2 of 37.5% and 20.3%
respectively.

Free cash flow2, being cash flow from operating
activities less cash flow from investing activities of the
Company, for the twelve months ended 30 June 2014
was an inflow of A$133 million, A$1,550 million higher
than the prior year outflow (of A$1,417 million). All
operations were free cash flow positive in the current
year except Hidden Valley.

Cash flow from operating activities for the twelve months
ended 30 June 2014 was A$1,037 million, A$110
million lower than the prior year (of A$1,147 million),
reflecting higher revenue compared to the prior year as
a result of increased sales volumes offset by the
continued effect of a lower average realised gold price
for the current year and the unwinding of approximately
A$200 million of favourable working capital balances as
at 30 June 2013. Cash flow from operating activities in
the current year was also adversely impacted by a A$64
million increase in interest payments associated with
higher average debt levels during the current year, a
A$70 million cash tax payment associated with the
Company’s voluntary amendment of its past Australian
research and development claims, and A$65 million of
restructuring expenditure associated with office closure
and redundancy costs.
Consistent with the Company’s stated aim of focusing
on free cash flow2 generation, a number of initiatives
were implemented during the current year. These
initiatives included reducing mining activity and
increased stockpile processing at Lihir, the cessation of
processing low-grade stockpiles at Cadia Valley and
reduced open pit activity at Telfer. These initiatives,
combined with the completion of major production
stripping programs at Telfer and Bonikro, resulted in a
reduction in open pit material movements across the
Company. Cost reduction activity has also resulted in
the transition to new contracts with reduced unit rates
across consumables and labour services, reduction in

Page198of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.workforce numbers through restructuring, and improved
consumption rates for power, reagents and
consumables.

Cash flow from investing activities for the twelve months
ended 30 June 2014 was an outflow of A$904 million,
A$1,660 million lower than the prior year (an outflow of
A$2,564 million). This was primarily the result of the
completion of the Lihir expansion project and the
commencement of commercial production at Cadia
East Panel Cave 1 in the prior year, lower sustaining
capital in the current year, and a lower level of
production stripping activity (primarily at Telfer and
Bonikro). Exploration expenditure of A$62 million was
A$90 million lower than the prior year.
Newcrest’s All-In Sustaining Cost2 per ounce sold for
the twelve months ended 30 June 2014 was A$976 per
ounce (US$897 per ounce), A$307 per ounce lower than
the prior year result of A$1,283 per ounce (US$1,318
per ounce). This improvement is primarily the result of
the higher sales volumes, production efficiencies and
reductions in sustaining capital expenditure and
production stripping activity.

Capital structure

As at 30 June 2014, Newcrest’s gearing level was
33.8%. Under current market and operating conditions,
the Board remains comfortable with gearing being at
this level in the short to medium term given the near
term cash flow growth outlook of the Group.

As at 30 June 2014 Newcrest had an equivalent of
A$1,808 million in cash and undrawn, committed bank
facilities. As announced on 28 March 2014, Newcrest
extended the tenor of many of its existing bilateral bank
loan facilities to provide a smoother and longer average
maturity profile of its debt facilities. Consistent with the
Company’s dividend policy - with dividend levels set
with regard to profitability, balance sheet strength, and
reinvestment options in the business - the Newcrest
Board has determined there will be no dividend for the
2014 financial year having regard to the level of
profitability and free cash flow2 in the current year, the
level of gearing at 30 June 2014, and the planned
application of operating cash flow to Cadia East Panel
Cave 2 in the 2015 financial year.

Outlook

All sites achieved production and cost guidance for the
current year, with some sites performing significantly
better. Looking ahead, Newcrest is firmly focused on
realising the full potential of each of the Company’s
assets, with a focus on the following:

 operational discipline (including safety);

 cash; and

 profitable growth
The Company expects to be free cash flow2 positive7,8
in the 2015 financial year at an average realised gold
price of US$1,250 per ounce, subject to market and
operating conditions, with the following guidance:

Page199of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved. Group gold production is expected to be in the range
of 2.2 to 2.4 million ounces
 Group copper production is expected to be in the
range of 75,000 to 85,000 tonnes
 Group silver production is expected to be in the
range of 2.2 to 2.5 million ounces
 Group All-In Sustaining Cost2 expenditure is
expected to be in the range of A$2,300 to A$2,600
million8

 Total capital expenditure (inclusive of project and
development capital, production stripping and sustaining
capital) is expected to be in the range of A$660 to
A$740 million, including approximately A$240 to A$280
million relating to the development of Cadia East Panel
Cave 2
 Total exploration expenditure (inclusive of on-site
exploration) is expected to be in the range of A$60 to
A$70 million
Depreciation and amortisation of site assets (including
production stripping) is expected to be in the range of
A$600 to A$670 million, including the amortisation of
capitalised production stripping.

Rio Tinto Ltd (ASE: RIO)

Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh said “Rio Tinto has
started the year with a series of performance records as
we continue to drive productivity gains across our
operations. Our Pilbara iron ore business has again
set new benchmarks for production, shipments and rail
volumes for the first quarter and we are well on track to
reach nameplate capacity of 290Mt/a by the end of the
first half of 2014. Our mined copper production
benefited from higher ore grades at Kennecott Utah
Copper and production ramp up at Oyu Tolgoi and we
also had a record first quarter for bauxite, primarily
driven by higher production at Weipa.”
• Record first quarter iron ore production, shipments
and rail volumes. Shipments from the Pilbara exceeded
production in the quarter, despite the impact of tropical
cyclone Christine which closed our ports for three days
at the end of 2013 and affected the progressive recovery
of rail and ports into January. The full ramp up is well on

Page202of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.track to achieve nameplate capacity of 290 Mt/a by the
end of the first half of 2014.
• Mined copper benefited from higher grades at
Kennecott Utah Copper and production at Oyu Tolgoi.
This more than offset the elimination of production from
copper assets divested in 2013.

• Record first quarter bauxite production and shipments
were driven by a ramp up of production at the Weipa
mine in Australia to feed the newly expanded Yarwun
alumina refinery.
• Production of coal improved in the first quarter of 2014
compared to the same period in 2013 due to the
productivity improvement programme.

• Exploration and evaluation expenditure was $155
million in the first quarter of 2014, sustaining the
savings achieved in 2013 whilst progressing the highest
priority future growth projects.

• On 13 March 2014, Rio Tinto launched the latest
phase of its industry-leading Mine of the Future™
technology and innovation programme. The Processing
Excellence Centre (PEC) is a state-of-the-art facility that
harnesses ‘big data’ in real time at seven Rio
Tintocopper and coal operations across the globe to
maximise productivity and improve performance.
Global iron ore production of 66.4 million tonnes (Rio
Tinto share 52.3 million tonnes) and shipments of 66.7
million tonnes set new first quarter records. Rio Tinto’s
share of production was eight per cent higher than in the
same period of 2013.
Pilbara operations
First quarter production of 63.4 million tonnes (Rio Tinto
share 50.6 million tonnes) was ten per cent higher than
the same period in 2013 and set a new first quarter
record, driven by productivity improvements and the
continued ramp up towards 290Mt/a.

Production in the first quarter was below fourth quarter
levels due to disruption caused by seasonal weather
patterns. Severe tropical cyclone Christine closed Rio
Tinto’s Pilbara ports and coastal rail operations in late
December. Heavy rainfall associated with this cyclone
and other adverse weather conditions in January and
February impacted across mine, rail and port
operations.

Following early completion of infrastructure works
associated with the 290 Mt/a project last year, the ramp
up to nameplate capacity of 290 Mt/a continued in the
first quarter of 2014. The newly commissioned system
achieved daily equivalent run-rates at or above
nameplate capacity on certain days in the first quarter,
although performance of the integrated system remains
variable. The commissioning remains on schedule to be
complete by the end of the first half of 2014.

Pilbara marketing
First quarter sales of 64.2 million tonnes (100 per cent
basis) were 17 per cent higher than the same period of
2013, setting a new first quarter record. Sales in the first

Page203of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.quarter continued to exceed production due to the
drawdown of iron ore inventories built at Pilbara mine
sites in previous years to facilitate the rapid ramp up of
shipments to 290Mt/a.

Pilbara expansion

Expansion of the port, rail and power infrastructure
capacity to 360 Mt/a remains on track for completion by
the end of the first half of 2015.

In November 2013, Rio Tinto set out its breakthrough
pathway to optimise the growth of mine capacity towards
360 Mt/a at a target all-in capital intensity of between
$120-130 per tonne (100 per cent basis), significantly
lower than originally planned. A series of low-cost
brownfield expansions will bring on additional tonnes to
feed the expanded infrastructure. From a base run rate
of 290 Mt/a by the end of the first half of 2014, mine
production capacity is planned to increase by more than
60 million tonnes a year between 2014 and 2017. The
majority of the low-cost growth will be delivered in the
next two years, with mine production of more than 330
million tonnes (100 per cent basis) expected from the
Pilbara in 2015.
Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC)

First quarter saleable production was 12 per cent lower
than the same period of 2013 due to the exceptionally
cold weather associated with a polar vortex experienced
in North America.

Pellet sales were 14 per cent higher than in the first
quarter of 2013. Concentrate sales were 33 per cent
lower than the first quarter of 2013 as a result of the
unusually cold weather.

2014 production guidance

2014 production guidance remains unchanged. Rio
Tinto expects to produce approximately 295 million
tonnes (100 per cent basis) from its global operations in
Australia and Canada, subject to weather constraints.
The full ramp up in the Pilbara to nameplate capacity of
290 Mt/a is expected to be delivered by the end of the
first half of 2014. The drawdown of iron ore inventories
at the Pilbara mines will continue to allow shipments to
ramp up ahead of production, with around five million
tonnes of inventory drawdown expected during the year.

Corporate

On 13 January 2014, Rio Tinto announced that it had
maintained its holding in Turquoise Hill Resources at
approximately 50.8 per cent following the successful
completion of the approximately $2.4 billion rights
offering which was fully subscribed. The proceeds of the
rights issue were used to repay loans outstanding to Rio
Tinto, and resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in Rio
Tinto’s consolidated net debt.

On 12 February 2014, Rio Tinto announced that it had
granted an option to LNG Canada to acquire or lease a
wharf and associated land at its port facility at Kitimat in
British Columbia, Canada. The agreement provides LNG
Canada with a staged series of options payable against

Page204of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.project milestones. The financial arrangements are
commercially confidential.

On 7 April 2014, Rio Tinto announced that it would gift
its 19.1 per cent shareholding in Northern Dynasty
Minerals Ltd (Northern Dynasty), owner of the Pebble
Project, to two local Alaskan charitable foundations. The
decision follows the strategic review of Rio Tinto's
interest in Northern Dynasty announced last year, which
concluded that the Pebble Project does not fit with Rio
Tinto's strategy.

EBIT margins which increased from 0.9% to 1.7% over
the previous year
Cash flow from operating activities was $210 million,

Final fully franked dividend of 10.0 cents per share
determined for FY14

Five year strategic plan now in place to achieve over
$300 million EBIT annually through internal initiatives
alone, with encouraging early stage gains beginning to
be realized

Sydney, Australia and New York, 22 August 2014
(ASX:SGM) (OTC:SMSMY) -- Sims Metal Management
Limited (the "Company") today announced a statutory
net loss after tax (NLAT) of $89 million, representing a
loss per diluted share of 43.5c for the full year ended 30
June 2014. Underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) was
$69 million, representing earnings per diluted share of
33.6 cents.
Sales revenue of $7,129 million in FY14 was down
0.9% compared to FY13. In constant currency terms,
sales revenue was down 10.5% due to lower sales
volumes and lower average non-ferrous and precious
metal prices.

Page205of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Sales volumes of 11.8 million tonnes in FY14
decreased by 7.6% versus FY13, due in part to adverse
winter weather in North America. Underlying EBIT
margins nearly doubled, driven by cost reductions,
divestment of underperforming operations, and early
stage benefits from asset optimisation strategies.
Underlying EBIT was $119 million in FY14, an increase
of 77.1% over FY13.
In announcing the result, Group CEO Galdino Claro
said, "The FY14 result is a positive improvement over
last year in the face of still challenging market
conditions. While I am encouraged by the progress
we've made, much work still needs to be done."

"Our stronger result was driven by solid contributions
from our metals recycling businesses in Australasia and
Europe, where recent investments and restructuring
actions are translating into meaningfully improved
earnings. These gains were partially offset by lower
earnings from the e-recycling (SRS) businesses in the
UK and North America. Softer earnings in North America
metals recycling business were impacted by weak
volumes associated with atypically severe winter
weather in the second half. Despite these conditions,
sales margins improved in North America as the
business began to place more emphasis on
transactional profitability."

Regional Performance

Commenting further on the performance of the regions,
Mr Claro said, "Our Australasian region continued to
headline our Group results. Underlying EBIT of $86
million was up from $52 million in FY13, due to strong
gains from Australia Metals. Underlying EBIT margins
increased from 4.8% to 7.0% on the back of higher sales
volumes, which were up 16.4%, as well as the benefits
from recent capital upgrades at our facilities which
began to take hold."
"Underlying EBIT for Europe of $20 million was a
well-earned turnaround from a loss of $19 million in the
prior year. The improvement was driven by stronger
earnings from UK Metals where previously undertaken
restructuring actions have gained traction, providing a
substantial positive impact on operational efficiency.
These improvements were offset in part by continued
losses from UK SRS, which necessitated our recent
decision to materially exit that business."

"Despite the margin improvement already referred to,
underlying EBIT for North America of $13 million was
down from $34 million in FY13, due to weaker earnings
from both Metals Recycling and SRS, and abnormally
severe winter weather impacting volumes. Through the
year, we continued to takes steps to streamline North
America, including the exit from our non-core Aerospace
Metals, Alabama and Utah businesses, loss making Gulf
region metals recycling business, as well as our loss
making SRS operations in Canada."

Strategic Progress

Remarking on the recent strategic progress at the
Company, Mr Claro said, "As we begin fiscal 2015 we

Page206of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.have accelerated our five year strategic plan to achieve
over $300 million of annual EBIT through internal
initiatives alone. While still in the very early stages, our
implementation timelines remain on track as we roll out
the initiatives across the Group."

"The capital budgeting process has now been aligned to
the new strategic plan, with a high degree of scrutiny
placed on new project proposals. In part due to this
more rigorous process, capital expenditures were
reduced by $85 million compared to the prior
corresponding year, and no acquisitions were completed
in FY14. We will maintain rigor in our capital allocation to
ensure we execute on expansionary projects with the
highest realistic expected returns."

Final Dividend
The Company has determined to pay a final dividend
for FY14 of 10.0 cents per share, which will be fully
franked, on 21 October 2014 to shareholders on the
Company's register at the record date of 7 October
2014. This is an exception to the Company's dividend
policy which is to distribute 45% to 55% of NPAT,
subject to the discretion of the Board and remains
unchanged. The Company's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan remains suspended.

Market Conditions and Outlook

Mr Claro stated on the outlook, "The year ahead will be
an exciting time at Sims Metal Management. The work
towards implementing our five year strategic plan is
gathering pace, with further benefits from our Streamline
and Optimise phases to be delivered in FY15."
"We expect 50% of the $32 million in annual EBIT
benefits from our Streamline program will be achieved in
FY15. Roughly half of this is anticipated to be realised in
the Europe region, related to the exit from our
historically loss making SRS business in the UK."
"FY15 capex is expected to be between $100 million to
$120 million, with expansionary capex devoted to
projects directly aligned with achieving the Optimise
goals set out in our strategic plan. Expansionary projects
planned for FY15 include the new yard and shredder
plant in Western Australia, and upgrade investments at
three of our non-ferrous metal recovery plants in North
America."

"At this early stage of trading in FY15, intake volume
has shown minor sequential improvement across all
regions we operate. Despite results so far in FY15 being
consistent with plan, we remain of the view that
conditions in the near-term will remain constrained."
