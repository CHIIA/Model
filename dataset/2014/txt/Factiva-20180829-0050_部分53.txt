THE dairy industry has welcomed investment in a new dairy company based at Camperdown that
aims to grow milk supply and increase the amount of Australian dairy produce exported into Asia.
Camperdown Dairy International (CDI) was formed when agricultural investment management
company EAT Group joined resource development company MCG Group to buy the Camperdown
Cheese and Butter Factory and farms.

United Dairyfarmers of Victoria (UDV) welcomed investments in new equipment to efficiently
manufacture dairy products, its president Tyran Jones (pictured) said.
CDI is now acquiring farms and its chief executive Phil McFarlane said it was at the 30 to 40 million
litre mark of the 100mL goal.
If the company is investing in new farms to grow milk supply, the UDV would support that, Mr Jones
said.

"It seems a fairly positive 'watch this space' because it seems they have money behind them and are
securing growth in export sector, which is where we want to see growth in the Victorian dairy
industry," he said.
CDI aims to grow its own milk supply including by developing bigger farm enterprise systems Mr
McFarlane said.

Although farm acquisitions take time to negotiate, farmers have been receptive to the idea, he said.

Other arrangements such as co-investment can help farmers expand without taking sole financial risk,
he said.
CDI aims to milk 10,000 cows and secure another 200mL on contract to serve Asia's surging
demands.

It will be the first vertically integrated, farm-to-distribution supply chain operation in Australia and will
export bulk whole milk powder and infant formula powder to Asian markets, primarily China.
The plans include a new $120 million spray dryer at Camperdown. Work on the site is scheduled to
start next month and the processing plant is expected to come online at the end of 2015.

Initially, it is expected to employ 30 to 50 people.
Aussie Farmers Direct's Camperdown Dairy is a separate company and will also continue to operate
from the site.
