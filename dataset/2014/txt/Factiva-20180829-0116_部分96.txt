Snapshot:
Roc Oil Ltd was established in late 2006 by Dr John Doran and listed on August 5, 1999, closing at $2.02
on 8.8m shares, a small premium to the $2 float price.
ROC Oil on its website pays tribute to the founder, saying in part, "Immediately following the sale of
Command Petroleum, John established ROC in late 1996. For a brief period, ROC was a start-up
company with no assets, no partners, no working capital and John as CEO with a business card that
declared him as the "Only Employee" (this was not applicable for long). For the next two years ROC was a
private company, with John and his growing staff assessing potential opportunities in India, Australia,
Malaysia, Indonesia, parts of Africa, the Middle East and the UK. ROC listed on the ASX in 1999 and
completed an initial public offering to raise A$150 million. He passed away suddenly in June 2008.

Page282of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Our note: Remarkably stable register. Apart from Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd that ceased to
be substantial on February 25 2014 on investor transition, there has been no movement in the register
since the annual report dated April 10.

Broker recommendations:

Well followed by brokers.
*On March 25 a leading broker in a report on Australian large and small oil companies listed ROC as its
top choice in its order of preference for small cps (followed by Aurora, Karoon, Senex, Horizon, AWE and
Drillsearch) with an "overweight" rating and price target of 75c.

The broker said there was an 85% upside chance, and placed a bull case value of $1.11. The bear case
value is 65c.

*On March 19 in "StockAnalysis' Peter Strachan said ROC is well funded, but "there is no catalyst to buy.
There is downside risk as Zhao Dong permit runs out and Balai cluster performance uncertainty".

Peter said the Malaysian RSC project at the Balai cluster is pointless and will not make money since two
fields are gas prone and sub commercial so trial oil production at one field will just cover outgoings. ROC
is producing about 8,200 BOPD. it is re-examining BMG for gas in Gippsland.
ROC is exploring adjacent to Zhao Dong in Block 09/05 in China and is facing license extension in 2018 in
China, so the market will see little value ahead of a decision that is not likely until the last minute, Peter
said in the report.
