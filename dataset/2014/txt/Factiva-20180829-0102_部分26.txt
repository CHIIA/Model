TA Associates has joined the pile-up of private equity firms cashing in on a resurgent IPO market,
with preparations for a float later this year of its Australian and Hong Kong satellite company,
SpeedCast.
The business is expected to list at a value of between $250 million and $300 million, and sources
singled out UBS as likely advisers.

TA Associates' s decision to offload SpeedCast comes after less than two years of ownership.
Pacific Equity Partners is also pursuing a hasty exit from Spotless Group, the facility services and
laundry group it took private in August 2012 for $720 million. Like PEP, TA Associates intends to
retain a stake in SpeedCast, offering investors comfort about the post-float performance.
According to sources, the global mid-market private equity outfit may sell as little as 30 per cent into
public ownership, although others close to the discussions cautioned the scale of the sellout is yet to
be determined.

SpeedCast, bought by TA Associates in September 2012, was formed out of two Australian satellite
firms and one Hong Kong-based company.

It provides very small aperture terminal satellite-based broadband access services, managed
networking solutions and value-added services in more than 50 countries. T he non-wire based
communications technology is used by the maritime, and offshore oil and gas industries.

SpeedCast, which has made two significant acquisitions in Australia in the past 18 months, will be
pitched as a an Asian growth story. Its closest comparative is RigNet, a Houston-based company
listed on the Nasdaq which provides the oil and gas industry with managed communications and
other network-based services.
