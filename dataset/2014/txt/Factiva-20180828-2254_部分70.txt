Paladin Energy Ltd. plans to raise about A$205 million via a private placement and an underwritten
entitlement offer to recapitalize the company and meet its medium-term funding requirements, according
to a Nov. 24 news release.
Under the placement, HOPU Clean Energy (Singapore ) Pte. Ltd. will unconditionally subscribe for about
144.9 million fully paid ordinary shares in the ASX-listed uranium producer priced at 42 Australian cents
apiece, for gross proceeds of A$61 million.

Paladin will issue the new shares, representing 15% of its current capital base, within the day. The
China-based private equity firm will then hold about 13% of the company's issued capital following the
placement.

In line with the offering, HOPU Managing Director Wendong Zhang was appointed to Paladin's board.

HOPU will be eligible to participate in a nonrenounceable entitlement offer that Paladin will undertake to
raise the remaining A$144 million.

Under the offer, eligible shareholders may subscribe for 1 new share for every 2 existing shares as of the
record date Nov. 27. Paladin Energy will offer the entitlements for 26 cents per share.

"The recapitalization package will allow Paladin to significantly de-risk its balance sheet and enhance its
future funding flexibility," Paladin Energy CEO and Managing Director John Borshoff said.
Proceeds from the private placement and entitlement offer will be used to fund the company's convertible
bonds due November 2015, and will serve as a cash buffer for working capital.

Separately, Paladin noted that it remains on track to meet its 2015 production guidance of between 5.4
million pounds and 5.8 million pounds of U3O8. The company earlier lowered its production forecast for
the September quarter due to issues at its Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia.

The Langer Heinrich mine introduced a new resin in the NIMCIX circuits, while scaling issues were also
resolved. Construction of the bicarbonate recovery plant at the site is scheduled for commissioning in
January 2015.

These initiatives put Paladin in a strong position to achieve its long-term cash cost target of US$20 per
pound at Langer Heinrich, the company said.
