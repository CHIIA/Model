ENERGY ORIGIN Energy will tap investors for $1 billion to help fund its next growth phase after
securing a stake in Western Australia’s gas-rich Browse Basin.
The energy producer and retailer will shell out $US800 million ($864.3 million) to buy a 40 per cent
stake in the Poseidon gas field held by junior explorer Karoon Gas.

Other Poseidon partners are US energy giant ConocoPhillips and Chinese oil giant PetroChina.
Both have pre-emptive rights to Karoon’s stake, meaning they could move to buy it ahead of Origin.

That is seen as unlikely and Origin managing director Grant King said a final investment decision
was expected in 2017 with construction work well underway by 2020.

Shares in the Melbourne-based Karoon — which had been facing funding difficulties — surged more
than 40 per cent yesterday. Mr King said the deal — the first for Origin in the Browse Basin — would
give the company a stake in one of Australia’s largest recent offshore gas discoveries that is ready
for development.
He also said it would form part of the company’s next wave of growth projects, with its $24 billion
Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project (APLNG) in Queensland due to begin production next
year.
APLNG is expected to generate around $1 billion a year in additional cash. “It is important that we
act now to invest in Origin’s continued development and growth through the latter part of this
decade,” Mr King said.

Poseidon is estimated to contain 3.25 trillion cubic feet of gas with the potential for further finds.

Mr King said processing the gas at sea by using so called floating LNG technology loomed as the
most feasible way to develop the project.
Poseidon is estimated to cost anywhere from $6 billion to $12 billion to develop.
Mr King said an equity raising would be launched after Origin’s full-year results on August 21.
Origin will pay Karoon $US600 million upfront, with another $US200 million in various payments
due on the final investment decision and first gas production.

Analysts said Origin had paid a premium to enter the joint venture. Last year PetroChina paid
$US370 million for its 20 per cent stake.

Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said investors were still waiting to see the finer points of the deal
but noted it marked new ground for Origin. “It’s definitely a strategic shift for them and we need to
assess that,” he said.
