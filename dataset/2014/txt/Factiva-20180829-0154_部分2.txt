THE value of buyout deals in Australia jumped last year, topping $100 billion, according to new
research.

It came despite a slide in the number of deals, research house Dealogic says. A report by the group
found the value of merger and acquisition activity was $US90.3 billion ($A101 billion) in the year to
December – up 16 per cent from 2012.

The number of deals fell from 1583 to 1366.
According to Dealogic’s research, “inbound deals” – where a foreign company buys a business or
major asset in Australia – accounted for a far smaller proportion of the tally in 2013.
The value of inbound deals tumbled 31 per cent to $US31.6 billion. In 2012, inbound deals
accounted for more than half the overall tally.
Dealogic’s report says the utility and energy sector was the most active, with 11 deals worth $US9
billion.
Chinese acquirers led the charge in the sector, accounting for three of the deals with a value of
$US7.5 billion.Buyout deals clocked in above $US120 billion in both 2010 and 2011.
