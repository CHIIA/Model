MINING: A third year of weak uranium prices has led to Paladin Energy's half-year net loss rising to
$US255 million ($283m).
The uranium producer does not expect any short-term improvement, shutting one of its two
producing mines last week and reducing production guidance for the year.

But Paladin predicts the nuclear power industry will recover and the long-term future will be positive
for uranium producers, with the current mine closures and lack of investment in new supply leading
to sharp price rises.
Chinese giant China National Nuclear Corp agreed last year to pay Paladin $US190m for a 25 per
cent stake in Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia, with regulatory approval expected this year.

Paladin's loss grew by 32 per cent from a $US193.5m half-year loss last year.

The result was inflated by a $US226.5m impairment on its Queensland exploration assets. Stripping
those out, Paladin's gross result was a $US29.3m loss compared with a $US11.3m profit last year. It
blamed the loss on a 21 per cent fall in the uranium price and higher impairment of inventory at the
loss-making Kayelekera mine in Malawi, which it put on care and maintenance last week.

Paladin cut its basic cost of production in the December quarter by 8 per cent to $US27.50 a pound at
the Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia and 24 per cent to $US33.10 at Kayelekera.
Paladin's average realised uranium sales price for the six months was $US38.40 a pound.

Following the decision to close Kayelekera, Paladin has revised its 2014 production guidance from
8.3-8.7 million pounds to 7.8-eight million pounds.

No dividend will be paid. Paladin shares closed steady at 47.5c.
