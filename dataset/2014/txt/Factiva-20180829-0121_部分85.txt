INVESTORS have punished the country’s newest iron ore miner after severe wet weather saw it
downgrade its shipping forecast and go back to the market seeking further cash to cover a funding
shortfall.

Shares in Western Desert Resources fell by more than 18 per cent yesterday, to close down 11¢ at
48¢.

Directors of WDR, which has just begun exporting iron ore to China, said after a $30 million
capital-raising in the December quarter, they were confident no further equity funding was required.
However, yesterday, WDR said it was seeking to raise a further $60 million through a share
placement.
The proceeds will be used to settle $15 million in derivative hedge liabilities, repay $12 million in
bridge financing from Macquarie Bank, pay creditors and top up working capital.
Combined with Monday’s biggest one-day plunge in iron ore prices in four years, the disappointing
start saw analysts wipe more than 20 per cent off WDR’s share price target.
However, billionaire pokies king Bruce Mathieson, a non-executive director who with entities holds an
almost 18 per cent stake, continues to show faith in the company, agreeing to back it to the tune of
$25 million.
He has committed to take up his full $11 million entitlement and sub-underwrite a further $14 million
of the share placement.

The offer comprises six shares, at an issue price of 50¢, for every 25 shares held, and is at a 15.3 per
cent discount on the last traded price on Friday of 59¢ a share.
WDR, whose board and investors also i nclude corporate heavy hitters Gold Coast lawyer and former
Billabong director Scott Perrin, former Coles Myer chairman Rick Allert, and present Fairfax chairman
and former Woolworths chief executive Roger Corbett, has previously been bullish about the
company’s rapid transformation into an iron ore producer.

But WDR blamed extreme wet weather and below-par performance from its barging contractor, PBS,
for a decision to downgrade its short-term shipping forecast and forcing it to go back to the market for
more capital.

WDR said it now expects to ship 120,000 tonnes in March and 180,000 tonnes in April before
achieving planned production levels of more than 250,000 tonnes in May and June. It also will replace
its barging operator.
Nathan Blair, manager of Ord Minnett Gold Coast, said it was “not the start WDR was hoping for”.

prices also had not helped but he anticipates the fledgling miner should begin posting positive returns
with the advent of better weather.
“With a lower forecast spot iron ore price and as a result of the share dilution we have revised our
share price target down by 23 per cent from 88¢ to 68¢ a share,” he said.$20 million stripped from big
