New Zealand owned dairy giant Fonterra has opened a dairy hub milking 15,000 cows in China this
year.
The hub produces 150 million litres of milk per year and is part of the company' aim to produce one
billion litres per year in the country by 2020.

Managing director of international farming at Fonterra, Henk Bles, says the farm using cows imported
from Australia and New Zealand is just the beginning.

"We are already at the moment constructing the second hub, in another area," he said.
"We are starting with construction and the goal is that for next year, 2015, we also have 150 million litres
produced over there."

The hub cluster is made up of five farms milking between 3,000-3,500 cows, each employing about 100
workers at each farm.
These farms are very different to Australian-style pasture-based dairy farms.

"We have all the cows housed in barns like a feedlot system."
None of the milk produced is processed by Fonterra.
It is sold to local manufacturers at what the company says is a premium price because it can assure food
safety.
Mr Bles says the dairy hubs are very profitable.
"There is no one company who can just make those major investments without making profit.
"There is a big need, a big demand, for high quality milk and they're paying us a big premium because
the quality of the milk."
