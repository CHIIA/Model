In Sydney, beaches, art and food; Beyond the handsome harbour, neighbourhoods full of art
spaces and innovative restaurants are cropping up

In ever-sunny, easygoing Sydney, don't let the famous attractions circling the handsome harbour
consume all your attention. Focus instead on the evolving neighbourhoods where art spaces are
cropping up beside train tracks, and innovative, chef-driven restaurants are opening at a rapid clip. If
you're searching for flash, look to Darling Harbour, where celebrity chefs like David Chang and Luke
Nguyen have opened outposts in the Star, a ritzy casino and entertainment complex that reopened in
2011 after a renovation costing around $800 million.

For more discreet indulgences, seek out the diminutive drinking dens that now pepper the city, the
result of a change in local liquor licensing laws that finally made business viable for small bars.

Then when it's time to dry out, the natural beauty of Australia's most populous city will be waiting along
the sandy beaches that lie just minutes from downtown.

And don't worry! You're bound to pass a certain opera house along the way.

FRIDAY
3 p.m.

Modern Masters

Sydney is the pre-eminent place for art on the continent, in part because of the city's soaring
multi-storey arts spaces. First hop over to the White Rabbit Gallery (free), which focuses exclusively on
contemporary Chinese art.

Rotating exhibitions draw from the gallery's vast collection, which includes stunning pieces such as a
life-size wire motorbike by Shi Jindian, a pile of Ai Weiwei's sunflower seeds and Tu Wei-Cheng's
reproduction of a chocolate shop stocked with tank- and bomb-shaped confections.

Then head uptown to the Rocks precinct where the renovated Museum of Contemporary Art reopened
in 2012 with a new five-storey wing.

Most interesting are the temporary exhibitions, such as last year's captivating Anish Kapoor
retrospective and, now, a thought-provoking collection from Yoko Ono.
6 p.m.

Duck, duck, dumplings

In a city flush with excellent Asian restaurants, one of the most exciting is Mr. Wong, a two-level,
Chinese-inflected establishment hidden down a narrow lane. The restaurant's elegant interior features
wood-beam ceilings, bamboo-framed chairs and rows of plump ducks hanging in the kitchen window.
After seeing the fowl, it will be difficult to pass up the Chinese roasted duck (half order, $34 Australian,

Page41of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.about the same in Canadian dollars) or the Peking duck pancakes (half order, $45), but save room for a
platter of delicious steamed dim sum ($32).
8 p.m.

Culture carriage

Near the ascendant Redfern area, a 19th-century industrial complex where railroad cars were once
constructed, is now a cavernous cultural hub called Carriageworks. At the old Eveleigh Railway Yards,
the venue hosts myriad contemporary arts events, everything from offbeat plays to large-scale art
exhibitions, in its many performance and exhibition spaces. Look out for an ambitious installation by
Christian Boltanski this month, and performances from the Samoan choreographer Lemi Ponifasio's
company of Maori dancers, MAU, in May.
11 p.m.

Basement bars

Finding Sydney's most atmospheric bars is no easy task. For example, to reach the Baxter Inn, you
walk down an unmarked alley, through an unkempt courtyard and down a flight of industrial-looking
steps to a nondescript basement door. When you're mumbling, "This can't possibly be right," heave the
heavy portal open to enter an attractive, dimly lit saloon with vintage boxing posters on the walls and
hundreds of fine whiskeys lined up behind the bar. A hip hangout, squirrelled away from view, is
Frankie's Pizza. The front half of the bar is a kitschy homage to a pizzeria, with plastic checked
tablecloths and Chianti-bottle candle holders, while the rear half houses a rollicking American dive bar
circa 1987, with pinball machines flashing and deep cuts from Guns 'N' Roses blasting. There are also
tasty sausage pizzas and craft beers from around the world, so plan for a very late, and fun, night.

SATURDAY
9 a.m.

Seaside salutations

Greet the morning with a series of sun salutations in stupendously scenic environs. Just over a
kilometre south of the more famous Bondi Beach, along a breathtakingly beautiful waterfront walkway,
is Bronte Beach, a boomerang of golden sand nestled between wind-worn cliffs, a verdant public park
and the Tasman Sea. Here, in full view of the aquamarine water, Yoga by the Sea holds restorative
hatha classes in a beachfront studio ($23). Sessions are also held at Bondi and Tamarama beaches,
but finding your centre amid the sea breezes and rhythmic crashing of waves in Bronte is hard to top.
After class, cool off with a dip in the sea or stake out a spot on the beach for a blissful, extended
savasana.
12:30 p.m.

Bronte bites

From the beach, it's a short, albeit steep, uphill walk to Three Blue Ducks, a casual restaurant opened
by three surfer friends. The vibe is laid-back; there are colourful murals painted across the walls, fresh
air wafting through open doors and windows. The organic-focused menu reflects a fine-dining
sensibility. During the antipodean summer, try a bright salad from the ever-changing menu; a recent
standout included spicy duck, green mango and bean sprouts. Then scope out the backyard garden
that most likely supplied some of the produce that graced your plate. Lunch for two, about $50.
3 p.m.

Neighbourhood shops

Spend the afternoon strolling through Surry Hills, a tranquil neighbourhood where the tree-lined streets
are home to organic markets, sidewalk cafés and stylish shops. Give your wandering purpose with a
shopping tour beginning at Mushu, an eclectic boutique brimming with vintage-inspired clothing, delicate
jewelry and bright leather bags. Then cross the road to the Standard Store, an airy shop stocked with
printed sundresses, striped sailor shirts and polished brogues for dapper ladies and gents. Afterward,
head to Workshopped, a cool housewares store packed with Australian-designed products, from
copper pendant lamps to amber glass jam jars.
7 p.m.

Grill guys

Milgate and Elvis Abrahanowicz. Dine on whole suckling pig and milk-fed lamb, roasted over an open
flame for eight hours, or try a steak cooked on the smoking parrilla. Should you find yourself waiting for
a table, head upstairs to Gardel's Bar, where you can whet your appetite with a Fernet Branca and cola,
a popular tipple in Argentina. Dinner for two, about $100.
10 p.m.

Little darlings

After dinner, head north to Darlinghurst, a slightly scruffier area dotted with great watering holes. Start
at Red Lily, a tiny Indochina-inspired cocktail bar that serves creative concoctions such as the Pham
Fatale (kaffir lime leaf vodka, lychee and ginger liqueurs, lemon, and coconut water; $18). Continue the
bar crawl at Shady Pines Saloon, a basement bar that could double as a taxidermist's lair.

It's easy to settle in here, shelling peanuts, listening to honky-tonk, petting the stuffed bull head and
drinking beer all night. But if you tire of the tongue-in-cheek Americana, head out for a nightcap at Hinky
Dinks. At this '50s-themed bar, claim a seat on the banquettes and order one of the irresistibly cutesy
cocktails, such as the Hinky Fizz: strawberry-and-prosecco sorbet, gin, St-Germain, peach bitters and
grapefruit juice served in a sorbet cup ($18).

SUNDAY
10 a.m.
Bread and Brett

Start the morning mingling with the many neighbourhood pooches that accompany their owners outside
Bourke Street Bakery, a local institution that recently opened a fifth location.

At one of the original café's sidewalk tables, linger over a short black and a pear-and-berry muffin or
sweet pistachio crème brûlée tart.

Then grab a loaf of sourdough and walk up the block to the Brett Whiteley Studio (free), the former
home and workplace of the prominent Australian artist.

Now an exhibition space under the auspices of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the studio contains
some of Whiteley's abstract and surrealist pieces, as well as his well-preserved loft workshop, complete
with unfinished works, reference books and inspiration wall.
12:30 p.m.

Harbourside hideaway

Seaside beaches such as Bondi can get crowded, so instead soak up the sun harbourside. One
secluded swath of soft golden sand on the harbour's eastern edge is Camp Cove Beach, where clear
turquoise water laps the shore.

It's the sort of secret spot where Sydney-siders come for a picnic, a swim and a reminder of the nature
that lies so close to their concrete metropolis. To reach this hidden beach, take the ferry from Circular
Quay to Watsons Bay, a relaxing ride that also affords a fine view of the white wedges of the iconic
Sydney Opera House, backed by the steel arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
