2325 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian equities may dip in
early trading after the S&P 500 backed away from an
all-time high Friday. IG predicts S&P/ASX 200 will open
down a couple points at 5636 and notes the fall in the
iron-ore price is likely to play on investors' minds. The
benchmark still couldn't break above 5650 Friday,
although it did manage a fresh six-year closing high of
5645.6. "It looks like bears are defending positions
above 5650 vigorously," IG market strategist Evan
Lucas says. Lucas adds many stocks will be trading
ex-dividend over the coming 10 trading days, which
could prove a drag on the overall market. Market
heavyweight BHP Billiton's (BHP.AU) U.S. ADR fell
0.9%, setting the tone for trading in Australia.

2316 GMT [Dow Jones] What's Bega Cheese (BGA.AU)
to do with its cash? Bell Potter notes the company's
balance sheet is in a healthy position and can
adequately fund investment in supply expansion and
new capacity, with surplus cash still remaining.
Consolidation remains a desire but there's also the
scope to release surplus franking credits that now total
A$23.6 million and could support special dividends, Bell
Potter says. It retains a hold recommendation and
A$5.43/share target after BGA's FY14 underlying profit
was broadly in line with expectations. BGA last traded at
A$5.25. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2313 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY may trade in a
103.50-104.50 range with bias on the upside after Fed
Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that should consumer
prices and wages rise, the Fed could increase rates
sooner than the mid-2015 timeline the market expects,
says Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in
Tokyo. "Her comments at Jackson Hole were balanced,
and took into consideration the positions of the more
hawkish members of the Fed," he said. Mr. Ishikawa
says the pair's next resistance is at 104.50, where thick
selling offers are seen. "Stop-loss orders will be
triggered once this level is breached," he says. He tips
the EUR/USD at 1.3150-1.3250. The USD/JPY is at
104.19 and the EUR/USD is at 1.3197.

rating on Spark (SPK.NZ), formerly known as Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand, as the company is trading above
its 12-month target price of NZ$2.65. The company is
currently trading up 0.7% at NZ$2.88. It adds that
scepticism about the turn-around strategy seems to
have evaporated judging by the share price strength
removing a catalyst for re-rating. It adds that it still sees
risks in the fixed line business but "in a sector which is
trading at full valuations in our view, Spark yield support
and balance sheet flexibility limit the downside."

2258 GMT [Dow Jones] RBC Capital Markets says
Santos's (STO.AU) latest gas-condensate discovery in
the Browse Basin offshore Western Australia state is
good news, but development is likely to be slow. On
Friday, Santos said its Lasseter-1 exploration well had
struck a 405-meter net gas-condensate column and that
testing had indicated 78 meters of net pay. "With
uncertainties on the Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AU)
Browse project, the entry of Origin (ORG.AU) into the
Poseidon project, the collapse of Bonaparte FLNG and
the strong potential for that project to be used as
Darwin-LNG backfill gas, the Western Australia
development opportunity may be long-dated and highly
competitive," RBC says. The broker rates Santos at
sector perform, with a A$16.00 price target. STO last
traded at A$15.16. (david.winning@wsj.com;

10:49 GMT [Dow Jones] AMP's (AMP.AU) valuation is
again moving back toward the relative premium it used
to hold as a relatively safe, stable stock, says J.P.
Morgan which nevertheless retains a neutral
recommendation. The brokerage says there remains the
likelihood of continued volatility in financial protection
trends, and on top of the AMP isn't paying full-franked
dividends. Its price target rises to A$5.47/share from
A$5.19 after what it says was a good first-half result
from the company. AMP last traded at A$5.77.

2247 GMT [Dow Jones] The overall global recovery
remains on track, but its gradual and it is not an
environment where central banks will be in a hurry to
take away the punch bowl, says AMP chief economist
Shane Oliver. "It's important to note that the Fed is
gradually becoming less dovish," he added. Federal
Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's opening address to
the annual central bankers get together in Jackson Hole
effectively reiterated her assessment that considerable
labor market slack remains but acknowledged
uncertainty in assessing the degree of slack. "Yellen's
somewhat less dovish comments are consistent with the
Fed edging closer to starting to raise interest rates but
remain consistent with the first move on rates not
coming till around mid next year," Mr. Oliver said.

2240 GMT [Dow Jones] IOOF Holdings' (IFL.AU)
near-term prospects are likely to be helped by
acquisition-led EPS growth and a dividend payout ratio

Page194of416©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.at the top end of the company's guidance range, says
J.P. Morgan. It maintains an overweight
recommendation in anticipation of strong earnings
growth into fiscal 2016 and a healthy fully-franked
dividend yield. IOOF's FY14 underlying profit came in
slightly ahead of J.P. Morgan's forecast. Its price target
rises to A$9.83/share from A$9.44. IFL last traded at
A$8.95. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2236 GMT [Dow Jones] While the Indonesian export
ban on bauxite is likely to add pressure to prices of the
commodity over the medium term, J.P. Morgan notes
the impact on China has yet to be felt materially.
"Further, lower electricity prices in some regions are
helping to offset higher bauxite input costs," the broker
says. Input costs for alumina are typically more
weighted to energy than bauxite. "On this basis we
believe there is a risk the 'cost push' theory to support
higher alumina prices could be less dramatic and take
longer to play out," J.P. Morgan says.

2234 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter lifts QBE Insurance
(QBE.AU) to buy from hold as its price target rises
toA$12/share from A$11.60, in line with its
sum-of-the-parts valuation. "There is a growing
probability that macro, micro, technical and stock
supply/demand are about to collide--in a good way--for
QBE," says director Charlie Aitken, adding it is the
cheapest stock on a forward price/earnings-to-growth
ratio in the ASX 20. Aitken says QBE's underlying
business is very sound, and the stock could again trade
at A$16 over the next few years. QBE last traded at
A$11.27. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

10:34 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian markets may be under
early pressure given weak offshore leads after U.S.
stocks finished mostly lower amid central bank speak
and geopolitical turmoil, says Macquarie Equities broker
Brad Gordon. In New Zealand and Australia investors
will remain focused on results. The NZX-50 has opened
0.2% higher as investors are cheered by a positive
result from retirement village operator Metlifecare
(MET.NZ). The stock is up 3.5% to NZ$4.50. Chorus
(CNU.NZ) is flat at NZ$1.73 as investors digest the
result.(rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)
10:31 GMT [Dow Jones] Mining accommodation builder
Fleetwood's (FWD.AU) challenges were underscored
last week when it foreshadowed a A$5 million asset
impairment ahead of its FY14 results due Aug. 26. With
the mining sector showing little sign of rebounding,
attention will shift to Fleetwood's balance sheet.
J.P.Morgan notes the company has a one-year debt
facility with Westpac for A$73 million, which is expected
to expire in December 2014. The broker expects
Fleetwood will look to refinance this facility and extend
the duration in the coming months. "With net debt
increasing to A$60 million at June 2014 and the
majority of historical earnings skewed to a sector that
will continue to put pressure on suppliers in the near to
medium term, we retain our underweight
recommendation," J.P.Morgan says. FWD last traded at
A$2.47. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
