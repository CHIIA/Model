Dissenting shareholders have failed in their attempt to amend Australian Roc Oil Company's
constitution in a bid to frustrate the company's planned A$800 ($751) million "merger of equals" with
Horizon Oil.

But new bids have emerged to challenge the marriage (IGR 752/35). The amendment was put to the
vote at an extraordinary general meeting in Sydney July 11, called by funds management company
Allan Gray and Hostplus Superannuation. Allan Gray is ROC's biggest shareholder with a stake of
20%.

The meeting was called to vote on a special resolution to amend ROC's constitution with a view to
calling off the proposed merger with Horizon. The amendment failed to gain the required approval of
75% of the votes cast, garnering just over 51.15% in a poll.

The merger was agreed by the two companies on April 29 and is targeted for completion in August. The
deal may be further complicated, however, by the emergence of two unidentified bidders, who have
approached ROC with unsolicited indicative proposals.

Under the terms of the agreed merger, Horizon shareholders would receive 0.724 of a share in ROC,
which would retain its identity as the operator of the expanded group's assets in Malaysia, China and
Papua New Guinea. ROC's existing shareholders would hold around 42% of the merged company,
with Horizon shareholders owning about 58%.
