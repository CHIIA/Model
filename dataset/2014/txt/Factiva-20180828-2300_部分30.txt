2135 GMT - GrainCorp (GNC.AU) continued its run of better grain receivals over the past two weeks,
handling 1.24 million tons in the week through Nov. 17. That means receivals are now 11% above the
same time during the 2012/13 harvest. Still, JPMorgan maintains its underweight call with its target price
of A$7.60/share pointing toward 5% downside to the stock's current level. The broker remains concerned
about stronger competition in GrainCorp's key east coast market as rivals build more grain-handling
infrastructure. "We do not believe the negative impact of fractionalizing revenues over GrainCorp's fixed
cost base, combined with the increased capex requirements to remain competitive have been factored
into the current share price," JPMorgan says. GNC last traded at A$8.01. (david.winning@wsj.com;

2124 GMT - For the moment, the copper market is enjoying a period of ample supply, with the pace of
output outstripping demand growth. That won't last for too long, though, according to Wood Mackenzie
copper analyst Eleni Joannides. Before the end of the decade, Asia's ballooning appetite for the
industrial metal is expected to absorb more metal than the world's miners can produce. That's expected
to bolster the commodity's value, which could incentivize new mines and expansions. "Beyond 2018,
mine supply will be insufficient to meet market demands and this will lead to deficits emerging and
upward pressure on prices," Joannides says. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)
2117 GMT - Expectations of a shortfall of copper in years to come could prompt miners to spend more
digging up copper ore, investors say. "If [BHP Billiton (BHP.AU)] are correct and copper is facing an
extended period of deficit, then expansion [of existing copper operations] would be a no-brainer," says
AMP Capital portfolio manager Andy Gardner. He says that over the next 5-10 years "we do expect to
see copper pay off handsomely." Still, given the commodity price boom that in 2011 sent copper
rocketing above US$10,000/ton appears to have cooled, Mr. Gardner questions whether costly and
complex projects, like any expansion of BHP's Olympic Dam, would be profitable enough. He also
worries that innovations in manufacturing could result in less copper needed for household goods.

16:15 EST - TIC data for September show foreign official and private accounts buying a net $48B in
Treasury notes and bonds. That's the biggest monthly purchase since February, and affirms this year's
trend of capped Treasury yields even as the Fed scaled back its bond-buying program. The net-buying
occurred even as the US's top two foreign creditors -- China and Japan -- each slightly decreased
holdings. That was more than made up for my increased holdings by other nations, including Brazil,
Taiwan, Ireland and Singapore. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)
16:14 EST - Chinese-owned mining company EcuaCorriente S.A. paid $30M as advance royalties for
its Mirador copper project in Ecuador. A first tranche of $40M was paid in 2012 and a final payment of
$30M is still pending. Mirador is the first large-scale mining operation in Ecuador. It is expected to start
production in 2017. (mercedes.alvaro@wsj.com)
2110 GMT - BHP Billiton (BHP.AU) has poured billions of dollars into expanding its iron-ore and coal
mines in recent years. Those days are now over and the world's No. 1 miner has its eyes on a new prize:
copper. The shift to this industrial commodity is a bold bet China is shifting to a consumer-driven
economy that will consume more copper-laced products after years of heavy demand for steelmaking
ingredients iron ore and coking coal. "Copper demand is going to continue to grow for a really long
time," says BHP marketing president Mike Henry. "Our confidence in that transition [to a

Page77of253©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.consumer-driven economy in China] is as strong as it has ever been," he says. He expects the market
will face a significant shortfall by 2018 and that, without new or expanded mines, global copper demand
will outpace supply for at least a decade. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

2052 GMT - AUD/USD is likely to trade in a range of 0.8700 to 0.8750 ahead of the FOMC minutes due
late in the global day, says Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer. He adds while Australia has the
Westpac leading index and job vacancies data the market highlight should be the FOMC minutes later in
the global day with markets looking for guidance on possible tightening; "By early 2015, markets should
start pricing in an RBA tightening cycle, which should boost the AUD, although Fed tightening
expectations will be an offset." The pair is at 0.8728 vs. 0.8718 late Tuesday in Sydney.

15:46 EST - Mexican state oil firmPemex says its corporate reorganization--approved today by the
board--will make the company more competitive and efficient as it prepares for private-sector rivals to
enter the market under new energy laws. Pemex's four existing subsidiaries will be reorganized into two,
one for exploration and production, and the other for refining, gas processing and petrochemicals. Five
new units will be created for drilling, transportation (including pipelines), electricity cogeneration,
fertilizers and ethylene. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

15:26 EST - The Motor City has long suffered from high auto insurance rates. Now Detroit Mayor Mike
Duggan is pushing for an unorthodox solution: the creation of the city's own insurance for car owners.
Today, the city council approved a $75,000 study to determine the feasibility of a city-sponsored
insurance company. A September report from insuranceQuotes.com found Detroit metro area drivers
have the nation's most expensive car insurance. Some critics blame the state's controversial no-fault
coverage requirements in addition to the city's high crime rate. (matthew.dolan@wsj.com;

14:48 EST - NZD/AUD rose overnight as RBA Governor Stevens spoke of expectations for further falls in
the AUD, trading above 0.9140 at one point this morning "before succumbing to the results of the dairy
auction," says BNZ strategist Kymberly Martin. She says the auction showed average prices down 3.1%
from the previous event a fortnight ago. NZD/AUD now trading around 0.9090 from 0.9104 late last
session. Martin says with no significant data events on the local agenda, all eyes will be on the release of
the US Fed's meeting minutes. "If these prove sufficient to jolt the USD out of its current consolidation
phase, the NZD would be an obvious casualty." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)
14:34 EST - Bond ratings firm Fitch says Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio is falling toward 25% of GDP at
the federal level, but provincial debt remains high. That results in an overall debt-to-GDP of around
87.5%, almost twice the AAA median. "The two largest provinces, Ontario and Quebec, have found it
harder to close budget gaps than the federal government and are running deficits," Fitch notes. It's
forecasting that the general government deficit will decline to 2.1% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015, bringing it
into line with the 'AAA' median, but does not expect the general government to move into surplus within
its forecast horizon. (don.curren@wsj.com @dbcurren)
14:30 EST - In addition to a stronger dollar and Middle East tensions, gold is also benefiting from
investors playing it safe and covering short bets ahead of Wednesday's release of minutes from the
Fed's October meeting. And there are many, many short bets: the number of contracts betting on a
decline in gold last week were at their highest level since July 2013, according to Barclays. Some of
those investors may want to lock in their profits before tomorrow, just in case a less-optimistic Fed
causes gold shorts to stampede for the exit, taking prices higher. Gold closed up 1.2% to $1197.10 a
troy ounce on Comex, a one-month high. (ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com)
