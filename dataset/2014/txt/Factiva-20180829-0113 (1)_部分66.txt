MARKET CLOSES DOWN A FEW ON TINY VOLUME WORTH $2.6 BILLION

Our market, that fell on opening to a low of 5391.3, closed down just 9.1 points to 5413.7, shrugging off
the US markets plunge on Friday and also taking the World Bank's trimming of its forecast growth for
emerging markets and China in its stride. However very low volume of just $2.6 billion pointed to
investors mostly deciding to sit on their hands.

Strong Aussie job ads were a plus (but a far cry from boom times in New Zealand as reported by
TradeMe today), as well as hopes of a beneficial Free Trade Agreement with Japan, said to be imminent.

The $A was barely changed on Saturday levels at 92.79 US c.

*Wesfarmers was a talking point, up 51c to $42.08 on 1.7m shares after selling most of its remaining
insurance business for $1.1 billion, a pre tax profit of $310/$330 million.

*Flexigroup rose 6c to 43.63 on 1m shares.

*Mesoblast fell 48c to $4.61 on 1.59m shares in line with the sell off of the biotechs in New York.
*Gold miners Regis, up 11c to $2.33 on 2.2m hares and Newcrest, up 38c to $10.30 on 4m shares were
among the winners.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 270 points to 14,810, Shanghai CSI physical was closed
on holiday. Hang Seng futures was down 182 points to 22,348 points, S&P futures was down 3.4 points
to 1856.70, Nasdaq futures was down 9.5 points to 3528 points, Dow futures was down 23 points to
4,633 points.
Gold futures fell $1.30 to $1302.20. Crude futures fell 39c to $100.75.
