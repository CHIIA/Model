Over the week our market fell 37.7 points or 0.7% to 5312.4, rising only one day - yesterday - in the New
Year, but very light volume means not too much can be read into its performance.

Our market has weakened as evidence that China's economy is slowing piles up, with a glut of metals
particularly given massive expansion by the iron ore miners, likely to lead to sharply lower prices -
although today's strong import number for China should give encouragement.

Stocks - of all sizes - with strong overseas income in Europe, the UK, NZ and the US remain attractive,
given their strong recovery and the weaker $A.

"Support at 5300, resistance at 5330 then at 5345, down 10 points on the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500's uptrend is still in tact, just consolidating
this week pending the reporting season. 1840 seems to be a bit of resistance, it has struggled to push
through 1840 this week with fairly strong support at 1825.

Page124of276©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The Shanghai market is still pretty week. It is in short term down trend. The critical 2000 level has
managed to hold, worth keeping an eye on.
"Gold is consolidating in a short range.

"The XJO performance has been pretty weak against the US markets this week. There seems to be
plenty of selling pressure at the 5350 level where it ran into profit taking.

"Yesterday it closed on its high after four down days in a row. 5350 remains resistance on the daily chart
for this week. Yesterday it tested the 5300 level where there seems to be very strong support.

"Our market is range bound, looking for direction and is still threatening to break lower. It needs to hold
the 5300 level. If it doesn't hold, we will test 5250 and 5200 quite quickly.

"For the day I expect support at 5300 if tested to hold. Resistance is at 5330 and then at 5345.

"I'll call it down 10 points on the day following a surprising late rally yesterday - it may give some of that
back".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 8.4 points to 5324.4 last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY

*Canaccord Genuity analyst Warwick Grigor's "Outlook for Commodities" posted separately.
CHINA'S IMPORT/EXPORT COMMENTARY:
Reuters reports China's export growth slowed more than expected in December due to a higher
comparison base a year earlier and a clamp-down on speculative activities disguised as export deals,
missing the official target on foreign trade.

But the outlook for 2014 is expected to be brighter as global demand picks up, giving more wiggle room
for Chinese leaders to push through reforms to balance the world's second-largest economy.
"Exports weakened dramatically, but were close to the consensus. The data is positive for China and
Asia sentiment as it alleviates concerns that China is slowing too sharply," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a
senior economist and strategist for Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.

Exports rose 4.3 percent in December from a year earlier, the Customs Administration said on Friday,
slowing from 12.7 percent in November and compared to market expectations of 4.9 percent.

Imports rose 8.3 percent, quickening from 5.3 percent in November and overshooting the same rate
expected by the market, raising optimism that domestic demand may remain firm despite signs that the
world's second-largest economy is losing steam.
The December trade surplus fell 24.3 percent from a year earlier to $25.6 billion, missing the forecast of
$31.2 billion.

Exports to the United States rose 3 percent in December from a year earlier, while sales to the European
Union rose 3.9 percent and those to Japan climbed 5.5 percent, according to official figures.

For 2013, exports rose 7.9 percent and imports rose 7.3 percent, producing a trade surplus of $259.8
billion, up 12.4 percent from 2012.
China's combined exports and imports rose 7.6 percent in 2013, below the official target of 8 percent. In
2012, China missed a 10 percent annual growth target. The government does not set any target on
exports.

Uncertain global demand, a stronger yuan currency and rising labour costs have taken their toll on
Chinese exporters, but analysts believe sales could pick up modestly in 2014 due to improved demand
from the United States and Europe.
"The biggest surprise is December imports. This suggests China's domestic demand is continuing to
improve," said Sun Junwei, China economist at HSBC in Beijing.

"We expect exports to show further recovery in 2014, but the magnitude would be small and at around 10
percent. Imports could be supported by steady domestic demand and are likely to grow around 8 percent
this year."
Li Jian, head of foreign trade research of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic
Cooperation - the Commerce Ministry's think tank, has also predicted 2014 export growth of around 10
percent.

The government is due to issue fourth-quarter gross domestic product data on January 20. A Reuters poll
showed annual GDP growth could slow to 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter, putting 2013 growth on track
for the weakest showing in 14 years.

*NEN/Others: Cua Lo-1 being plugged and abandoned, development unlikely
Neon Energy advised testing of the Cua Lo-1 exploration well, located in Block 105-110/04 offshore
Vietnam has been completed. The drill stem test was conducted over a period of five days between
2,397m and 2,435m in the 4.5Ma sandstone reservoir, chosen as it offered the greatest resource potential
at this location. The presence of gas was confirmed with a peak flow rate of 400,000 scf/d through a
16/64 inch choke. Although gas flowed during the test, poor reservoir deliverability combined with high
carbon dioxide content suggests development of the reservoir at this location is unlikely. Operator ENI is
