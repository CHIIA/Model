2356 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Australia's S&P/ASX 200 should stay quiet during the U.S. holiday, although
the market will be watching China's official manufacturing PMI data at 0100 GMT and HSBC's final
China manufacturing PMI at 0145 GMT. Barring any surprises there, the resources sector should benefit
from the bounce in iron-ore prices. Spot iron ore rose 0.7% to US$87.90 after last week's decline to a
two-year low of US$87.20. The broader market will be relieved that the major offshore equity markets
didn't react to Russia's increased incursion into Ukraine. However, the Ukrainian situation remains tense,
with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling for "Statehood" talks and the West threatening further
sanctions. It's a big week for economic data, with domestic GDP due Wednesday and U.S. employment
on Friday. Central banks are also in focus with the RBA meeting Tuesday and the ECB meeting
Thursday. Index last 5625.9. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2335 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Activity across Australia's manufacturing sector contracted in August as the
persistent strength of the Australian dollar put a dent in confidence. The Australian Industry Group's
Performance of manufacturing Index fell 3.4 points to 47.3 in August from July, with a drop below a
reading of 50 points indicating a decline in activity. Only the large food, beverages & tobacco and the
smaller wood and paper products subsectors expanded in August. A decline in new orders during the
month ended three months of promising expansion, the report said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

2325 GMT [Dow Jones] The steep fall in iron-ore prices since January led Grange Resources (GRR.AU)
not to pay an interim dividend, and J.P.Morgan doesn't think payouts will resume later this year either.
That is despite Grange's cash balance remaining healthy at A$109 million at end-June, representing
around 40% of the company's current share price. J.P.Morgan had expected to declare a 1 cent/share
dividend alongside its 1H results. The broker rates Grange, which reported A$50 million underlying
Ebitda for the six months through June, at overweight with 40% upside to its last traded share price of
A$0.165. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2317 GMT [Dow Jones] -- The USD/JPY likely will be stuck in the 103.60-104.50 range in Asia trade, with
investors unable to move ahead of a slew of events later this week such as the European Central Bank's
policy meeting and U.S. jobs data, says IG Securities market analyst Junichi Ishikawa. China PMI data
are in focus, especially on how the AUD/USD will affect the USD/JPY. But "That will be short-lived," if
any, he says. The pair is at 104.13 against 104.08 in New York late Friday. Mr. Ishikawa also says
investors need to be cautious about downside risk of the EUR/USD to break below 1.3100, but the pair
may be vulnerable to short-covering due to a lack of fresh cues during Asia trade. The pair is tipped in a
1.3100-1.3200 range and is now at 1.3134. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan initiates Nine Entertainment (NEC.AU) at Overweight with a A$2.42
target price. The broker favors Nine's strong FY15 TV revenue share growth outlook, forecasting a 0.8%
increase to 39.5%, assisted by the acquisition of the Perth/Adelaide Metro TV stations and the positive
effect of the Cricket World Cup. It also expects the company to be well placed in any future media
consolidation. NEC last A$2.06. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2313 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Although Virgin Australia's (VAH.AU) financial position gradually should
improve, and it could reach break-even by FY17, its share price is being kept artificially high by its three
big airline backers, says J.P. Morgan, which keeps an underperform recommendation on the stock.
State-backed Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Etihad own around 70% of the Australian carrier.

that the transformation of Virgin Australia into a full service domestic carrier and its low-cost carrier in
Tigerair will pay off in the medium term, we believe it may end up costing more to do so," the broker
says. It lifts its share-price target to A$0.35 from A$0.30 vs. the shares' last trade of A$0.415.

2302 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Credit Suisse lowers its forecast for Sandfire Resources' (SFR.AU) FY15 net
profit by 13 million Australian dollars (US$12.1 million) after the Australian copper miner outlines higher
exploration and corporate expenses. It adds that the profit reduction would have been A$9 million
deeper were it not for a concentrate shipment that took place a few days after FY14 ended, even though
production had occurred earlier. Credit Suisse expects Sandfire to report net income of A$76.5 million in
FY15, with a full-year dividend of 16.28 cents a share. That came after Sandfire unveiled a maiden
dividend of 10 cents/share alongside its FY14 results. The broker rates Sandfire at underperform with a
A$5.72 price target. SFR last traded at A$6.34. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2245 GMT [Dow Jones] -- National Australia Bank's (NAB.AU) exit from Great Western Bank is clearly
capital positive over time, but capital won't be released ahead of expected substantial charges likely to be
booked with the bank's fiscal 2014 results, says Credit Suisse. The brokerage anticipates a sale price for
Great Western of 1.5 billion-2 billion Australian dollars (US$1.4 billion to US$1.9 billion), based on
current valuations for U.S. regional banks, which isn't material for NAB beyond its significance as part of
NAB's restructuring story. "This transaction will--perhaps prematurely--bring forward expectations as to
what might be achievable in the U.K. with Clydesdale Bank." Credit Suisse has an outperform
recommendation and A$38/share target. NAB last traded at A$35.20. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2238 GMT [Dow Jones] -- The latest corporate earnings season in New Zealand "has been broadly
consistent with our expectations," says Chris Green, director, Economics and Strategy at First NZ
Capital. Of the 33 companies monitored, 39% posted double-digit earnings-per-share growth. In the other
direction, 30% of the 33 companies reviewed showed a contraction in EPS of more than 3% "with these
companies showing the negative impacts of an exposure to a subdued Australian economy (or more
broadly soft global markets), competitive domestic market conditions and/or the adverse effects of an
elevated NZD." Overall, outlook comments continued "to have a generally positive tone, with most
companies expecting NZ trading conditions to remain supportive over the year ahead," Mr. Green says.
The key risk seemed to center around external economic developments (particularly the prospects for the
Australian economy), although the political uncertainty surrounding the upcoming general election was
also of some concern, he says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)
