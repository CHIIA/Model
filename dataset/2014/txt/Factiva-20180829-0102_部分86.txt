Bullabulling Gold is digging in its heels after chairman Peter Mansell came out strongly yesterday
against a hostile takeover bid by Norton Gold Fields.
In a letter to shareholders yesterday, Mr Mansell said the company’s board considered the
7c-a-share offer “inadequate and opportunistic”.

Mr Mansell claimed 41.8 per cent of shareholders have indicated they intend to reject the takeover
bid, an Easter surprise sprung by Norton on April 17. “Your directors believe that the offer is
fundamentally opportunistic and timed to suit Norton’s best interests without reference to the true
value of the company,” Mr Mansell said.
Norton’s biggest shareholder, China’s Zijin Mining Group, already controls 2.5 per cent of
Bullabulling shares.

Norton claims 6.6 per cent of shareholders held by unnamed parties have indicated they will accept
the offer. It marks the latest acquisition target for Norton, which has missed out on Barrick Gold’s
Kanowna and Yilgarn South assets in the past year while absorbing Kalgoorlie Mining Company.
The Brett Lambert-run Bullabulling has been targeting mid-2016 for first production at its 3.75 million
ounce gold project near Coolgardie. But the major capital requirement of at least $450 million has
led industry insiders to doubt it will ever become reality.
The company’s quarterly report released yesterday showed it had just $3 million cash in the bank,
while it has also delayed its definitive feasibility study until the first quarter of 2015.
Bullabulling shares closed up 2.7 per cent yesterday at 7.5 cents, valuing the company at $25.1
million according to Bloomberg data.

Norton changed hands for 10 cents yesterday and is on track to pour between 176,000oz and
184,000oz this year.
