While the Rolling Stones' recent shows in Australia and New Zealand in late March/early April were
postponed following the death of Mick Jagger’s partner, L’Wren Scott, on March 17, earlier dates for the
legendary band, from February to mid-March, launch the group to the top of the weekly Hot Tours ranking.

The Stones grab the No. 1 spot with $41.6 million in ticket sales reported from the first leg of the '14 On
Fire tour. Kicking off in the United Arab Emirates on Feb. 21, the tour played to sellout crowds in five
markets through mid-March. The inaugural performance was staged at du Arena, an outdoor concert site
located on Yas Island near Abu Dhabi. Appearing in the UAE for the first time, the legendary rock band
played to a crowd topping 30,000 at the open-air venue. Next the tour moved to Japan for a three-show run
at Tokyo’s 55,000-seat sports venue, the Tokyo Dome. From concerts on Feb. 26, March 4 and 6, ticket
sales at the domed baseball stadium topped $27.9 million, the largest gross reported to Billboard during the
first quarter of 2014. The Tokyo engagement marked the Stones’ return to Japan for the first time in eight
years. The group’s Bigger Bang tour played stadiums in four cities in the country in 2006, including the
same Tokyo venue.
Three more sold out 14 On Fire performances in Asian cities followed during March beginning with a show
at CotaiArena in the Chinese territory of Macau on March 9. An arena performance on Mainland China
drew a crowd of 10,751 to Shanghai’s Mercedes-Benz Arena on March 12, and the trek through Asia
wrapped on March 15 in Singapore.

The next leg of the Stones’ tour will include 13 concerts in 12 European countries as well as a show in Tel
Aviv, Israel. The summer jaunt will begin on May 26 in Oslo, Norway and include four festival appearances.
The final date will be a performance at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on July 3.

Eminem and Metallica both land on the Hot Tours recap with multi-million dollar grosses from stadium runs
on separate sides of the globe. Eminem takes the No. 2 slot with performances in six cities in New
Zealand, Australia and South Africa. The rapper’s Rapture tour began in Auckland, New Zealand on Feb.
15 with a capacity crowd at Western Springs Stadium and $6.8 million in ticket sales. Aussie audiences
packed stadiums in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney during the trek that was produced by
Melbourne-based concert promoter, Dainty Group. Adding revenue earned from performances in Cape
Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, the Rapture tour grossed $31.9 million from 290,967 sold tickets at
six concerts. This summer, Eminem is set to play a string of co-headlining stadium dates with Rihanna,
kicking off on Aug. 7 in Los Angeles.

Metallica scores the No. 3 ranking with $24.8 million in revenue from a slate of South American
performances at stadiums and outdoor concert sites in seven countries. The band’s By Request tour kicked
off in Bogatá, Colombia on March 16 and continued through the end of March, wrapping with a two-night
stand in Buenos Aires on March 29 and 30. The top gross came from a stadium date on March 22 in São
Paulo, Brazil. With a crowd of 61,742 in attendance, the Estádio do Morumbi racked up $5.7 million in sales
from a single performance. Prior to the By Request tour, ticket holders for each show were allowed to vote
for the songs they wanted to hear in their set, and the band added a new song to accompany the hits
chosen by the fans. Metallica will continue the By Request format during this summer’s European run that
begins in May.
