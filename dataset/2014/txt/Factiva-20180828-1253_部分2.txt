China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. has booked a 66.13% year-over-year higher net profit attributable to
shareholders for the six months ended June 30, with the company attributing the improvement to the
consolidation of its Australian copper business, cost reductions and investment gains.
First-half results, released Aug. 11, revealed net profit of 1.01 billion Chinese yuan, or 19.8 fen per basic
share, compared to 604.9 million yuan, or 11.92 fen per basic share, for the same period in 2013.

Operating revenue rose to 3.71 billion yuan during the period, from 2.69 billion yuan a year earlier,
marking a 37.79% rise.

This was despite a drop in the average market prices of between 8% and 16% for molybdenum, tungsten,
copper and gold.
China Molybdenum said its 80%-owned Northparkes copper-gold mine in New South Wales, Australia,
which the company bought from Rio Tinto in the second half of 2013, experienced a smooth transition
and good operations with a record-high volume of mining and processing.

In the first half of the year, the mine's cash production cost was 53 U.S. cents per pound, which
contributed net profit of US$62.1 million.

Additionally, costs across the molybdenum and tungsten segment were lowered through the optimization
of mining and processing allocation, innovation in technology research and development and other
measures, China Molybdenum said.

The first-half cash production cost of molybdenum and tungsten concentrates decreased by 16% and 8%,
respectively, compared with the budget for the whole year.
Net profit was also positively impacted by the sale of China Molybdenum's 70% stake in Luoyang Kunyu
Mining Co. Ltd. to Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. for 700 million yuan.
China Molybdenum produced 7,681 tonnes of molybdenum during the period, which was in line with the
prior year at 7,662 tonnes, and sales totaled 9,870 tonnes, compared to 8,290 tonnes in the first half of
2013.

Meanwhile, tungsten production climbed to 3,649 tonnes from 3,264 tonnes a year earlier and sales rose
to 3,807 tonnes from 3,533 tonnes.
Salable copper production totaled 21,724 tonnes, while sales reached 22,025 tonnes.
As of Aug. 11, US$1 was equivalent to 6.16 Chinese yuan.
