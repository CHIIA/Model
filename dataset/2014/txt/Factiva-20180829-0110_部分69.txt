Mount Gibson Iron's ore shipments fell 22% on year in January-March and 19% from the previous
quarter, to 2.02 million wet mt, because of wet weather in Western Australia, the Perth-based
company said Thursday.
But the miner said it expected to sell 9.5 million wmt for the 12 months to June 30, which was within its
guidance range of 9 million-9.5 million wmt for fiscal 2013-14. Mount Gibson's shipments for the nine
months to March 31 were 7.1 million wmt, up 11% year on year from 6.4 million wmt.

The miner said in a December quarter report operations at its Koolan Island mine, which is off the
Kimberley coast north of the Pilbara region, had been impacted by a tropical cyclone in late December.
Heavy rains prevented access to the main pit for three weeks and generally disrupted production until
mid-March, Mount Gibson said.
Its standard iron ore product grades around 62% Fe, but it also sells a small amount of waste ore
grading 52-53% Fe from Koolan Island to China's Rizhao Iron & Steel and also from its Tallering Peak
mine in the state's midwest region.
The company reported an average price of US$95/dry mt CFR for sales of its standard fines for the
March quarter, compared with the Platts 62% Fe average of $120/dmt CFR over the period. For its
lower-grade product, it received an average of $62/dmt CFR in January-March.

Mount Gibson said its contract pricing was a mix of lagged month and current month shipments. It also
sells some ore to Gindalbie Metals in a mine gate sale arrangement, which is priced on a free-on-train
basis. The two miners both export from Geraldton port. Major shareholder APAC Resources sells ore
from Mount Gibson to Chinese customers.
