Pub stalwarts the Aussie Leisure Group are selling popular Tea Gardens Hotel in Bondi Junction.

The popular watering hole on Bronte Road in the heart of Bondi Junction's retail precinct last changed
hands in 2006 for $44.75 million, and comes in the same month high-profile pubs including Coogee's
Beach Palace Hotel have changed hands.

Tea Gardens is the latest in a line of ALG assets on the chopping block. The group in 2013 sold the
Iron Horse in Newcastle for about $10 million, in addition to the Winham Point Tavern in Queensland,
which netted just under $10 million. The Meadowbrook Hotel in Brisbane's south is nearing the end of
its expressions of interest campaign. It is understood the site could fetch more than $15 million.

"The annual profit delivered regularly by the Tea Gardens puts it firmly in the A-Grade asset class,
and enjoys similar status to the Coogee Bay Hotel, the Golden Sheaf in Double Bay, the Newport
Arms," listing agent Andrew Jolliffe of Ray White said.
