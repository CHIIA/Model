THE Strathtay Angus stud received a fitting farewell with an outstanding result at the stud's dispersal
sale held on-property at Narrogin last week.
The sale closed the door on 48 years of Angus stud breeding for the Young family, after the stud was
established by stud principal John Young and his late father Jack in 1966.

It's not often that stud females of this calibre hit the market and a host of WA stud and commercial
Angus enthusiasts joined some interstate interest to grab the opportunity with both hands.

In total, 185 2005-2012-drop PTIC Angus breeders and eight mixed aged cow-calf units, that had
calved early, and a number of embryo packages were offered with the females displaying the
performance data and elite pedigrees the Strathtay brand is renowned for.

Under the control of the Elders selling team, with guest auctioneer Miles Pfitzner, GTSM, Naracoorte,
South Australia, strong bidding throughout the entire catalogue ensured a complete clearance of all
stud Angus females and most of the embryo packages to seal a memorable and deserving result for
the Young family.
After a 3.5 hour selling marathon, the sale grossed a total of $441,400 and averaged a healthy $2278
for the 193 breeders, with values peaking at $6800 for a young 2011-drop PTIC matron.
It was a day of mixed emotions for Mr Young and his family, with the stud being sold due to a change
in the family's farming regime and the subsequent succession planning.
Before the sale, Mr Young said although the stud was dispersing, the family would continue to farm
and he assured buyers he would stand by the cattle and would be available to offer any assistance to
buyers.
Following the sale, Mr Young said he was over the moon with the result.
"We really appreciated the support shown today and I'm sure buyers will be happy when they get their
purchases home," he said.
"I'm extremely proud of the cattle, it was the best herd I had ever presented. Producers bid
accordingly and prices reflected this but there was also some value buying.

"There is some trepidation out there without the season breaking yet but the solid beef market is
giving producers some confidence.

"For such a big number of cows, it was a remarkable result."

With such a strong representation from stud and nucleus breeders, the Strathtay legacy will continue
in the Angus industry for some time yet.

home almost half of the female catalogue.

Sheron Farm was unrelenting on its way to amassing a team of 89 Strathtay breeders and was
prepared to pay top dollar if required to secure its selections.
Its purchases included the sale's $6800 top price.

Included in the operation's ready-made stud Angus herd were 29 2011-drop breeders ($1500-$6800),
23 2012-drop heifers ($1500-$5000), 13 2010-drop breeders ($1500-$3750), 11 2009-drop females
($1300-$2700) and 13 older 2005-2008-drop cows ($1300-$2500).

Sheron Farm manager Gavin Tapscott said they were sourcing the best quality females available to
stock the new Sheron Farm property which was purchased before Christmas.

Although undecided on which direction to take their new herd, Mr Tapscott said stud females of this
quality gave them more scope.
"Starting with breeders such as this we can create a long-term and sustainable farming business," he
said.
"It gives us more opportunities to participate in the up and coming markets such as Russia and China
which are chasing top Angus beef breeders.
"The Strathtay sale was probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to obtain females from a herd of this
quality.

"There is only a certain amount you can do on a property the size of Sheron Farm, so you have to do
it properly."

Mr Tapscott said they viewed the Strathtay breeders in the paddock with Mr Young the week before
the sale.

"We appreciate John giving us his time to see the cows in their natural environment," he said.

"You don't come across too many herds such as this and after doing some homework, it was all we
needed to come back on sale day."

Mr Tapscott said they had a couple of options up their sleeve for their sire requirements following the
Strathtay females calving and were keen to look through the Strathtay yearling bulls for sale.
The sale's $6800 top-priced female didn't appear until lot 108 in the sale.

Strathtay Benhilda G103 was a late July, 2011-drop twin daughter of Eastern State's sire Hazeldean
C10 and out of Strathtay Benhilda Y111. It recorded above average EBVs for most of its recorded
traits and is due to calve on May 6 to USA sire SAV Thunderbird 9061.

Mr Young described the young female as a "cracker".
Sheron Farm continued to pay top values throughout its extensive purchases including the sale's
$5000 second top price for the heifer Strathtay Annabelle H9, a mid-May 2012 drop daughter of USA
AI sire Sydgen and out of the homebred cow Annabelle E216.

The low birthweight heifer is due to calve to Ayrvale General G18 on May 28 and recorded strong
performance data including a top five per cent for milk, top 10pc for retail beef yield, and top 20pc for
calving ease and gestation length.

Despite the dominant buying performance from Sheron Farm, there was still a number of buyers that
paid strong values for their selections and collected decent numbers of Strathtay breeders.
DL & J Jansen, Fernwood Farms, Ledge Point, paid the sale's equal $4600 third top price and equal
$4200 fourth top price for two of four females.

The $4600 Strathtay Ida G79 was a late June 2011-drop daughter of Hazeldean C10 and Strathtay
Ida Y102 and was due to calve on May 10 to SAV Thunderbird.

The $4200 Strathtay Tango F71 was a mid-May 2010-drop daughter of homebred sire Cameron C207
and due to calve to Ayrvale Genetic G11 on June 24.

mixed age breeders for an average of $3175 and paid the sale's $4200 top cow and calf price for
Strathtay Tango E210, a mid-September 2009 drop daughter of Hazeldean C10 and her bull calf at
foot by Aberdeen Estate Facilitator F103.

E210 displayed extremely strong performance data including being a trait leader for 600-day weight
(+128) and in the breed's top 5pc for 200 and 400-day weights, mature cow weight, days to calving
and carcase weight.

Other buyers to pay above the $4000 mark for their selections included Tony Golding, Little Meadows
Angus stud, Dardanup, and AMH Hattingh, Wannamal.

Mr Golding outlaid a healthy $3800 average for three Strathtay heifers with his $4200 top price paid
for Strathtay Tremble H31, an AI late May 2012-drop daughter of Eastern States sire Pathfinder Total
E34 and due to calve on May 28 to Ayrvale General G18.

H31 showed extremely strong growth data ranking off the charts for 200-day weight (+54) and the top
5pc for the other growth traits, mature cow weight, carcase weight and terminal index.

The Hattingh family paid to $4000 for one of two cows, a mid-June 2009-drop daughter of Bangadang
Cameron Y24 and out of a White Lakes cow and due to calve to Booroomooka Inspired G662 on
June 6 that also displayed outstanding BreedPlan data with trait leading figures for 600-day weight,
retail beef yield, heavy grassfed and terminal index.

Successful buyers of larger numbers included Alastair Murray, Tullibardine Angus stud, Albany, and
Treeton Lake, Busselton, with 10 females each.

Mr Murray paid to $3700 each for eight mixed aged breeders and two cow-calf units while Treeton
Lake bid between $1300-$2500 for its 10 2006-2011-drop cows.

Small Holdings, West Swan, collected eight 2007-2011-drop breeders to $1800 and Mountain Valley
Pty Ltd, Narrikup, took home two mixed aged cows and calves and five cows to $2400.

Long-time supporter of the Strathtay stud Colin Thexton, Independent Rural Agents, Pemberton,
purchased four cows and one cow calf unit to $3000 for his own Blue River Grazing and one cow for
J, JM & DA McDonald, Northcliffe, while IRA client Henderson-Glendale, Mayanup, paid to $2400 for
six 2008-2011 breeders.

Talooby Angus stud, Rylestone, New South Wales, was the only successful Eastern States cow buyer
with one 2011-drop cow for $3200.
Rounding out the sale was the 23 embryo packages with 18 of them selling at auction for $100 each.

Henry Strating, Superior Blacks Angus stud, Oldbury, secured four embryos of USA sire Hamilton
9H24 and Canadian dam Coldstream Miss Pride, one embryo of USA sire Bradys Booker 918 and
Canadian dam Knights Blackbird 9Y and one embryo of USA sire New Trend 315 and Miss Pride.

Interstate buyer Ken Wharton, Willoughby Angus stud, Murgheboluc, Victoria, collected four embryos
of New Zealand sire Kaharau Cresendo 72 and Strathtay Tremble Q98 and eight embryos by the
same sire but from dam Strathtay Annabelle U30.

With strong demand for the Strathtay breeders, producers that missed out on their selections will have
the opportunity to buy Strathtay's stud maiden heifers later in the year.

Elders stud stock manager Tim Spicer said it was a strong result.

"It was the first genuine Angus dispersal held in WA for some time," Mr Spicer said.

"There was good representation from stud and commercial breeders from all over the State.
"A lot of people attended the sale interested in viewing cattle from a stud almost 50-years-old and
plenty of these people came to buy.
"With a volume buyer operating, I thought the underbidders made the sale and the respectful $2278
average.
"Elders thanks everyone for attending the sale and bidding with confidence and wishes the Young
family all the best for the future."
