Several institutional investors have snapped up a share of the $505 million stake in GPT Group
that was sold by the Government Investment Corporation of Singapore.
Broker UBS completed the sale of 132.4 million GPT securities, or about 8 per cent of the register,
at a price of $3.815 per security, the diversified property group's net tangible asset value.

The deal has prompted speculation that China Investment Corp may look to sell down its 9.8 per
cent holding in Goodman Group, valued about $800 million.
CIC first bought into Goodman in 2009, and in 2012 the Chinese fund sold a 6.9 per cent stake
worth about $520 million, to several superannuation funds.
Analysts do not believe the GPT share sale is an indication that overseas investors consider the
Australian market is getting too expensive.
