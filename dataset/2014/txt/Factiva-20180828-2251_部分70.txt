The Australian sharemarket continued to power ahead today, lifting another 47 points or 0.88% to
5368.80. The materials sector performed strongest led by Newcrest Mining which rallied 5.3% to $10.53.
Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals managed to claw back losses made earlier in the session to close the
day 2.21% higher at $2.77. Mining giant Rio Tinto added 2.07% to close at $59.18 and fellow mining
major BHP Billiton was up 1.48% to $30.89.

The banks are also gaining strong momentum: Westpac rallied today by 1.71%, ANZ Bank lifted 1.42%,
National Australia Bank added 1.17% and Commonwealth Bank ended the day 0.84% higher.
Gains in the energy sector was capped by explorer Santos, which postponed a hybrid issue and
announced cuts to investments. Fellow explorer Woodside Petroleum continued its recovery, rallying
2.27% to close at $36.45. Oilsearch added 11 cents or 1.42% to $7.83.
Property and construction companyLeighton Holdings (LEI) today announced its subsidiary John
Holland won a $150 million contract to expand Sundrop Farms innovative agricultural production.
Sundrop has contracted for a 20 hectare state-of-the-art glasshouse that will grow truss tomatos. Using
solar energy they will desalinate seawater, generate heat to maintain temperature and produce
electricity to power the facility. This news lead to LEI driving market gainers for the day, with a 6.7% to
$21.18.
Engineering firm Monadelphous (MND) was up 3.37% to $8.90 today after announcing iits acquisition
of Water Infrastructure Group. The group has staff of 120 and annual turnover of approximately $60
million, and the acquisition came at the cost of $6 million plus purchase price adjustment for the final
net assets in February 2015. This net acquisition cost is expected to be immaterial to financial year
results.

Santos turnaround

Santos (STO), in a surprise turnaround in the day, closed down by a mild 3.85% to $8.73. After free
falling 9.8% to $8.13 after the open, Santos then fought its way back throughout the day to close where it
began. It appears that the energy company took the market a little time to digest its joint Monthly Drilling
Report with Beach Petroleum and realize all was not as bad as first thought.

Myer (MYR) in a shock daily performance fell 3% to $1.615. The retailer's performance was surprising
given that sales for October, which where released today, were up 0.4% m/m compared to market
expectations of 0.1% m/m. Woolworths, Wesfarmers, Harvery Norman, JB Hi-Fi, The Reject Shop and
Domino's Pizza were all positive following the retail sales data release, which was an interesting
outcome.

Banks and miners have led the SPI higher for the third straight session. The SPI rallied on the back of
the better than expected retail sales and trade balance figures, but it pulled back when it touched the
down trend line during the afternoon. The SPI then climbed towards its intraday high in the last few
hours. With the Nikkei and China indexes soaring through fresh highs, the SPI still looks relatively
undervalued. The European Central Bank is expected to announce positive comments about QE, which
should add bullish market sentiment for all stock markets.

The Aussie dollar made an intraday high of 0.8428 when both retail sales and trade balance came out
beating expectation, but these gains were short lived and sold off to make a fresh low of 0.8377. Further
downside pressure remains towards the next support levelof 0.8315, while tonight's ECB decision could
reverse the current down trend.
