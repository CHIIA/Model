Wealthy Chinese will pour A$44 billion (US$39.4 billion) into Australian real estate over the next
seven years, potentially pushing prices in one of the world’s most expensive housing markets even
higher, a study said yesterday.
Investment bank Credit Suisse used data from the Foreign Investment Review Board and other
government agencies to estimate the amount of Chinese investment in Australian residential
property at more than A$5 billion a year.

“They purchased A$24 billion of Australian housing over the past seven years; we forecast they will
purchase A$44 billion over the next seven, to 2020,” it said.

As the Asian powerhouse becomes richer, the ranks of those who could easily afford Australian real
estate will swell beyond the current 1.1 million people, with implications for Australian homebuyers, it
said.
“While Australia has some of the most unaffordable housing in the world, further strong Chinese
demand can push prices even higher,” it said.
“A generation of Australians are being priced out of the property market. Many face a lifetime of
renting.”
Australia has one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world on a house price to income
ratio, while median house prices in Sydney and Melbourne have risen by more than 30 percent since
the global financial crisis.
Chinese investment is welcomed by the Australian government, although it has become a sensitive
issue after rural politicians warned against selling valuable farm and mineral land to foreigners.
The Credit Suisse report found that Chinese buyers — some of whom are restricted to buying only
new homes — bought 12 percent of new housing nationally per annum, an amount considered
insufficient to drive prices up across Australia.

But because they are concentrating their buying in the east coast cities of Sydney and Melbourne —
where they are acquiring 18 percent and 14 percent of new supply — they were a much more
powerful force in these markets, according to the report.
