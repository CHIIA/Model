AQUILA SYDNEY, June 18 AAP - Mining contractor Mineral Resources has failed in a bid to take
control of iron ore explorer Aquila Resources.
Mineral Resources bought a near 13 per cent stake in Aquila Resources last week, and on Monday
made a share-swap takeover offer for the Pilbara explorer that valued it at $1.5 billion.

Aquila is already the target of a $1.4 billion cash takeover bid from Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and
rail operator Aurizon, as the companies involved look to kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara
Iron Ore Project.

Aquila said on Wednesday it had rejected Mineral Resources' takeover offer, and is still recommending
its shareholders accept the offer from Baosteel and Aurizon.

Talks between Aquila and Mineral Resources have ended, it said.
