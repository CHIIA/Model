Mining CHINA’S Baosteel is in the box seat to secure a massive iron ore holding in Western Australia
after Mineral Resources failed to take control of explorer Aquila Resources.
Aquila yesterday said it had rejected mining contractor Mineral Resources’ takeover offer, and is still
recommending its shareholders accept the offer from Baosteel and Aurizon.

Analysts say the move paves the way for the state-owned company to shore up new iron ore supply
and reduce the risk of higher prices in future.
Mineral Resources bought a near 13 per cent stake in Aquila Resources last week, and on Monday
made a share-swap takeover offer for the Pilbara explorer that valued it at $1.5 billion.
Aquila is already the target of a lower $1.4 billion cash takeover bid from steelmaker Baosteel and rail
operator Aurizon, as the companies involved look to kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara Iron
Ore Project.
Aquila chairman Tony Poli, who holds a 29 per cent stake in the company, intends to accept the
Baosteel and Aurizon offer, while other shareholders have until July 11 to accept it.

Mineral Resources plans to discuss its potential involvement in the construction of the mine, rail and port
project, as well as the operation of the mines as it considers what to do with its stake in Aquila. Analysts
say the Baosteel bid is likely to go ahead as the Chinese look to establish a large, stable supply of the
steel making ingredient.Morningstar Resources analyst Mathew Hodge said Baosteel wanted control of
Aquila. Aquila shares were up 23c, or 7.3 per cent, at $3.36 yesterday, while Mineral Resources shares
were down 28c at $9.28.
