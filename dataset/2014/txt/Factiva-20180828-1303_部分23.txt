Treasury Wine Says Buyout Firm Matches K.K.R.’s $3.2 Billion Bid

HONG KONG — Two of the world’s biggest buyout firms appear to share a taste for Australian wine.
Treasury Wine Estates, the owner of Penfolds, Beringer Vineyards and other popular wines, said on
Monday that it had received a bid competing with the $3.2 billion buyout offer it received last week
from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.

Treasury Wine did not identify the new bidder, which matched K.K.R.’s offer, referring to the company
only as “another global private equity investor.” But several news reports on Monday, citing
unidentified people, named the rival suitor as TPG, another leading American private equity group.

A spokeswoman for TPG in Melbourne, Australia, declined to comment Monday, as did a spokesman
for Treasury Wine.

Although the rival bid only matched K.K.R.’s offer of 5.20 Australian dollars, or $4.82, per share, the
emergence of another bid suggests a takeover battle for Treasury Wine and raises the possibility that
one or both of the private equity groups will have to raise their bids. Investors are betting that will
happen, and in trading on Monday in Sydney, Australia, they pushed shares in Treasury Wine to a
closing price of 5.33 Australian dollars apiece, a 2.5 percent premium to the buyout offers on the table.
K.K.R. offered $2.8 billion for Treasury Wine in April, but that offer was rejected by the winemaker’s
board of directors in May as undervaluing the company. Rhône Capital, a New York private equity
firm, joined K.K.R. in making the revised bid last week.
Clearly, private equity sees an opportunity to engineer a turnaround at Treasury Wine, which is based
in Melbourne and also owns the Lindeman’s, Rosemount Estate and Wolf Blass labels, among more
than 80 wine brands. In an effort to help reverse a decline in sales and profits in Australia and the
United States, the winemaker in March hired Michael Clarke, a former senior executive in Europe at
Kraft Foods and Coca-Cola, as its chief executive. In June, it said it would book an impairment charge
of 260 million Australian dollars in the value of its wine brands this year.
K.K.R.’s interest in Treasury Wine arises as it seeks to deploy some of the $6 billion it raised in July
2013 for a new Asia-Pacific fund, a record amount for private equity in the region. For TPG, a
successful takeover of the winemaker would be a sizable deal, coming at a time when it has been
making minority investments as it seeks to recover from giant bets that went sour during the financial
crisis of 2008.
