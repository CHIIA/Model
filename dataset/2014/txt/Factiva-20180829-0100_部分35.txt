Andy Morrison, CEO
Andy Morrison has substantial experience in the oil and gas sector having worked with a number of
major energy companies for over 30 years. His career started in 1982 at Shell International Petroleum
Company Ltd ("Shell") which saw him, amongst other achievements, devise and execute a marketing
strategy and build a local management team for Shell to enter the Chinese domestic consumer market
for oil products. Following 17 years at Shell, Andy was approached by BG Group to bring expertise in
leading major business development projects and was promptly promoted to Head of Corporate Strategy.

In 2005, Andy joined BOC Group plc where he reviewed new business development performance,
transforming a disparate and fragmented array of around 50 projects into a properly organised Pound100
million new business portfolio aligned to agreed strategic intents. Between 2007 and 2013, Andy went
on to take Chief Executive roles firstly at Xtract Energy plc, an AIM quoted energy company, followed
by Silvermere Energy plc, which he saw through asset acquisition, AIM admission and into first
production in the US and cashflow. Andy has a BSc (1st Class) in Chemical Engineering and Fuel
Technology from the University of Sheffield and has written a number of thought-leadership pieces based
on personal practitioner experience in the fields of innovation, venturing and strategic business
development.
