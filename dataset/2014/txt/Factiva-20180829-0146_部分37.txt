Sydney - Wednesday - January 29 (RWE) - Latin Gold Limited (ASX: LAT) confirms that the proposed
acquisition of the mig33 social entertainment platform will constitute a significant change in the nature
and scale of the company's activities (as contemplated within Chapter 11 of the ASX Listing Rules).
Accordingly, ASX Listing Rule 11.1.3 applies to the transaction and the company will need to obtain
shareholder approval for the transaction.

In addition, completion of the transaction is subject to the company satisfying ASX's reinstatement
conditions and complying with Chapters 1 and 2 of the ASX Listing Rules.

Mig33 is a social entertainment platform featuring miniblog, chat, chatrooms, virtual gifts and games, is
available on Android, WAP and Web, and has over 3 million monthly active users.

The platform is tailored for emerging markets across South East Asia, South Asia, Middle East and
Africa which represent a population of over 3.5 billion people, and monetises not through advertising
but primarily through the sale of virtual gifts and games.
Part of this business model was developed to build on the success of the Chinese based Tencent
Holdings (700:HK), which now has a market capitalisation of over USD$120 billion.

Early results indicate that artists and celebrities using mig33 in Indonesia and South Asia are achieving
levels of engagement comparable to and exceeding that of their equivalent presence on Facebook and
Twitter.

With these results, the mig33 team is currently focused on broadening and polishing the service offering
and growing the user base in 2014.
