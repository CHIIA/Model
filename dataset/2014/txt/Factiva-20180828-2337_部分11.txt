Volatility is back baby! Phew! That was close. Market regathers its confidence following better than
expected Chinese PMI numbers. Not that anyone believes the numbers but hey, let's not spoil a good
rally. News that the US had struck at IS with a coalition of the willing was also a factor as we closed at
5416 around 52 points up and near its highs for the day.

After a tentative start, news that the PMI in China was up 50.5 against guesses around 48 ,was welcome
indeed. Green across the screen with even BHP Billiton Limited (A$34.95, +0.3%) rallying hard in the
afternoon session to close barely changed.. The big four were all very strong as bargain hunters stepped
into the breach, same in other financials like Macquarie Group Limited (A$58.71, +1.4%),Bt Investment
Management Limited (A$6.27, +0.8%) but property trusts failed to inspire as Scentre Group Ltd, GPT
Group (A$3.88, unch),Dexus Property Group (A$1.14, -0.4%) and Growthpoint Properties Australia
(A$2.69, -1.5%) all weaker. Insurance stocks though found friends with AMP Limited (A$5.70, +2.9%) the
stand out together with Insurance Australia Group Limited (A$6.17, +1.5%).

In the industrials Brambles Limited (A$9.96, +2.4%) was a standout having recently completed its
acquisition of Ferguson Group as Seek Limited (A$17.15, +2.7%) also boomed and Amcor Limited
(A$11.31, +2.5%) and Nufarm Limited (A$4.52, +12.2%) shrugged off results to soar. Healthcare stocks
were showing a rosy glow Csl Limited (A$73.88, +1.4%),Sonic Healthcare Limited (A$17.57, +1.6%) and
Ramsay Health Care Limited (A$50.80, +1.0%) to name a few in the green. Gamblers were on a roll as
Echo Entertainment Group Limited (A$3.31, +1.2%),Aristocrat Leisure Limited (A$5.97,
+2.9%),TABCORP Holdings Limited (A$3.67, +2.5%),,Tatts Group Limited (A$3.20, +2.6%) rolled 6's.

Miners were also in demand except BHP Billiton Limited (A$34.95, +0.3%) as the Aussie dollar collapse is
helping cushion the blow of much lower commodity prices. Chinese growth also helping sentiment
.Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (A$3.66, +2.2%),RIO Tinto Limited (A$60.20, +0.2%) and Newcrest Mining
Limited (A$10.36, +4.1%) the big ones firing although Atlas Iron Limited (A$0.505, -4.7%) failed to be
inspired Arrium Limited (A$0.395, +1.3%) picked up as did Sims Metal Management Limited (A$11.56,
+1.0%).

For the winners today we saw good gains in the following Nufarm Limited (A$4.52, +12.2%),TFS
Corporation Limited (A$1.87, +5.6%),Tpg Telecom Limited (A$7.00, +6.1%),Flexigroup Limited (A$3.60,
+4.7%),Newcrest Mining Limited (A$10.36, +4.1%) and Mesoblast Limited (A$4.51, +2.0%) in the bigs
and Indophil Resources NL (A$0.28, +33.3%)(takeover approach),Focus Minerals Ltd (A$0.012,
+9.1%),Antares Energy Limited (A$0.53, +6.0%) and #IPD# in the smalls. Losers though today included
Papillon Resources Limited (A$1.49, -5.7%),Western Areas Limited (A$4.53, -3.2%),Blackmores Limited
(A$31.95, -3.0%),Ten Network Holdings Limited (A$0.25, -2.0%) and Oz Minerals Limited (A$3.95, -2.5%)
together with #CUV#,#TIS# and Bougainville Copper Limited (A$0.295, -10.6%) in the small caps.
Turnover was solid at $4.4bn today.
Aussie dollar was 89.10 cents ,tulips at $452 and Gold at $1219.Asian stocks also perked up following
the Chinese print with Shanghai the best up 0.83%
