Our market has given up all of yesterday's gain in morning trade - with yesterday's strong gain a surprise -
although the $A has held overnight levels which were slightly higher than last evening's.

The reason for our market rise - and the dollar gain on the back of overseas buying is largely credited to
RBA Governor Glenn Stevens positive report on the Australian economy at yesterday's Credit Suisse
conference in Hong Kong - which also seemed to suggest a rate hike was possible.

Technically speaking we are in for a pull back

Meanwhile, Gerald Stanley, a Fibonacci chartist said yesterday's failure of our XJO to get back to the
previous high is a negative, and the fall below yesterday's low is another negative, suggesting a fall on the
index is likely from here.

He said the previous high on March 7 was 5462.7, yesterday's high was almost to 5400, which was still a
long way short of the March 7 high. Today's low of 5322.2 is lower than yesterday's low. Yesterday was
also the 13th day from the top, after going up on the 8th day - both Fibonacci numbers.

He added, "It was also a negative signal yesterday when we had more sellers than buyers although the
market rose".

"I'll call us down about 21 points, but we may hold better than that".

"Bernborough" said, "Yesterday I was surprised about how much we went up - we've got to give back
some of yesterday's gains today.

"There has to have been buying from offshore. Locals are not buying, but they are not selling either - so
any buying pushes stock prices and the $A up.

"I'll call us down about 21 points, but we may hold better than that".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 40.2 points to 5376.8 last evening.

*BKW: Brickworks Ltd for the half year ended January 31 announced a net profit after tax down 4.5% to
$53.427 million on revenue up 4.6% to $325,622 million.

A 13.5c fully franked dividend was announced, record date April 15. There is no DRP available.
Net profit before tax was up 16.2% to $68.2 million vs the previous corresponding period (pcp) with the
prior period adversely impacted by $8 million in significant costs before tax.

Normal eps was down 4.7% to 36.1c vs 37.9c for the pcp.

Basic eps was up 0.3% to 38.1c vs 38c for the pcp.

NTA backing per security is up 3.2% to $10.04 vs $9.73c for the pcp.

Brickworks continues to outperform the All Ordinaries Accumulation Index in terms of total shareholder
return over most time horizons. TSR for the year to January 31 was 15.7%, 5% higher than the index.

Gearing fell to 18.8% at January 31 2014 from 19.7% at July 31 2013. Total interest bearing debt
decreased to 4330 million and Net Debt was $313.9 million at January 31 2014. Net debt to capital
employed decreased to 15.2% for the half.
The chairman Robert Millner said in the report while EBIT was $19.2 million, up 36.7% on the prior
corresponding period and EBITDA was $31.8 million with improved earnings achieved on the back of
restructuring initiatives implemented in prior periods, the EBIT margin of 6.5% remains below acceptable
levels.
Brickworks made an itemised report on its various businesses. Its 42.72% stake in Washington H Soul
Pattinson returned a normalised contribution of $23.6 million for the half year ended January 31 2014,
down 17.8% from $28.7 million for the previous corresponding period due primarily to reduced eanings
from New Hope Corporation. SOL has delivered outstanding returns over the short, medium and long term
outperforming the All Ordinaries Accumulation Index by 2.6% p.a. over 5 yeras, 4% p.a. over ten years
and 6.6% p.a. over 15 years.

Perpetual/MH Carnegie Proposal

A general meeting to consider Perpetual and Carnegie's proposals is currently scheduled for may 5 2014.
The proposal has caused Brickworks to incur $1.8 million in costs during the six months to January 31. Of
greater concern is the major distraction to management and staff, the full impact of which is difficult to
quantify.

Outlook

The current upturn in housing activity has been relatively slow to translate into increased building
materials demand, with the notable exception of brick sales in WA.

"However we are now experiencing a more broad based recovery in demand with Austral Bricks sales
volumes in March tracking more than 30% ahead of the prior year .. if demand continues to build and
stock holdings fall to unsustainable levels, Brickworks is well placed with the flexibility to bring on kilns
currently mothballed. .." the company said in the report.

*SIP: NPAT up 186.5%, 2c ff final div, no DRP, $67.5m cash, no debt/positive

Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd for the financial year ended January 31 2014 announced a net profit after tax
up 186.5% to $53.536 million on revenue up 1.1% to $2.973 billion.

The group had $67.5 million in cash and zero debt at year end

A fully franked final 2c dividend was announced, ex date is April 3, record date is April 9. The DRP will not
apply.

Page305of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Managing director and CEO Mark Hooper said that targeted investment over the past three years is
beginning to show benefits across the business. The acquisition of Central Healthcare represents a
strategic opportunity for Sigma to open up avenues for growth in the retail pharmacy and hospital network.

He said a flat PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) necessitates a sharper focus on non dispensary
sales. Sigma is actively introducing a number of structured professional service initiatives into the Amcal,
Amcal Max and Guardian pharmacy networks. Also over 100 exclusive and private label products have
been launched in the past 12 months with another 200 in the pipeline, only available through Sigma's
pharmacy network including products such as the Boots Laboratories Serum7 and colour THEORY
ranges.

Outlook

Sigma expects to achieve revenue growth above the dampening effect of onging Government PBS price
disclosure reform in the coming year.

Sigma also has a strong cash positon to support ongoing capital management, the ability to pay future
dividends as well as fund investment opportunities.

Analysts expectations: $44.2 mln, div 2.2c.
Analysts comment: A leading broker yesterday said it expects revenue up 2% to $3 billion and EBIT of
70.8 million with a dividend of 4.3c.

The broker said SIP revenue should outpace the market via growth in Chemist Warehouse.

The broker said it still believes Chemists Warehouse has excessive terms, and faster growth will limit the
rate of working capital reduction.

Reduction in profits from atorvastatin among SIP's customers may further hinder reduction in working
capital, the broker added. Its price target is 62c.

*SIP: To acquire Central Healthcare for $24.5 mln +
Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd yesterday announced an agreement to purchase all of the issued capital of
Central Healthcare Pty Ltd for $24.5 million with the potential for a further earn out payment at June 30
2015.

Central Healthcare is a wholesaler and distributor of pharmaceutical products to hospitals and retail
pharmacies and is an approved CSO distributor in Victoria, NSW, ACT and Queensland. It also owns and
manages the Pharmasave retail brand.

Central Healthcare and Sigma will continue to operate as stand alone businesses. The current Central
Healthcare and Pharmasave management teams will continue to drive the businesses. (Mar 16)

Record date is April 17.
*Regular Profit after tax was $63.5 million, a decrease of 21.1% compared to $80.5 million. This was

Supreme Court has extended the time for holding the meeting until September 5 2014. SOL will determine
the actual date in due course.

*PAB: Positive Phase I/II results for PAT-SM6 for multiple myeloma patients

Patry's Ltd announced the final results from its Phase I/Iia open label study in patients with refractory or
relapsed multiple myeloma conducted in 12 patients, media range 71 years, with refractory or relapsed
multiple myeloma. On average each patient received five prior lines of therapy including proteasome
inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs or stem cell transplantation. Twelve patients, 3 in each cohort
received 4 intravenous infusions of PAT-SM6 at 0.3mg/kg, 1mg/kg,3mg/kg or 6mg/kg per dose. All
patients were then assessed for a response at36 days post final treatment. At all dose levels PAT-SM6
was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities being reported.

Patients who had received prior treatment with proteasome inhibitors responded much better to PAT-SM6
treatment than patients who had been previously treated with IMIDs or other chemotherapeutics. This
indicates that PAT-SM6 may act synergistically with proteasome inhibitors such as Carfilzomib to induce
better clinical responses. This will be tested in Patrys' next clinical trial in which PAT-SM6 is combined
with Amgen's Carfilzomib.

*QUB: Noble j/v grain handling facility at Pt Kembla/acquistions/placement,SPP
