0040 GMT [Dow Jones] The second-quarter measure of Australian inflation should be viewed as largely
neutral for the interest-rate outlook, says Sally Auld, debt strategist at J.P. Morgan. Nonetheless, threads
of evidence of disinflation should give the central bank confidence that inflation is behaving as expected
in an economy subject to an extended period of subtrend growth, she said. For the rates outlook, the
inflation data underscores the "slow burn" nature of the current cycle. Evidence of softer growth and
disinflation will take time to appear in the data, consistent with the view that if rate cuts are to occur, it will
be a fourth-quarter 2014 or first-quarter 2015 story, Ms. Auld adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

0038 GMT [Dow Jones] Telstra's (TLS.AU) balance sheet will be a key talking point around the telco's
full-year result on Aug. 14, says J.P. Morgan, given Telstra's recent sales of CSL and Sensis create
scope for capital management. Broker says Telstra has capacity to distribute more than A$2 billion
without raising its gearing. But the bank notes paying a big spectrum bill will reduce the slack and it's
likely Telstra's board will err on the side of maintaining flexibility for acquisitions and JVs. Ultimately, the
bank reckons a buyback will be part of the story; the question is whether it is sooner, with disposal
proceeds, or later with [National Broadband Network] cash flow. "We aren't forecasting a buy-back
announcement with this result but it would not surprise us to be wrong." (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com;

0038 GMT [Dow Jones] In the week ahead, it appears to be all eyes on the U.S., with Australian
economic data unlikely to provide a catalyst to break either resistance at US$0.9460/70, or support at
US$0.9340/50, says Sean Callow, currency strategist at Westpac. With commodity prices having
stabilized and a recent reduction in RBA rate cut pricing taking place, Westpac leans slightly towards the
topside of ranges for the Australian dollar and its major crosses this week, Callow adds. But, he says, the
U.S. dollar does have the opportunity to strengthen given the Fed should reduce QE again and sounds
somewhat optimistic in its statement. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

0030 GMT [Dow Jones] The poor price action in the New Zealand dollar has seen several key downside
support levels give way, leaving pressure to the downside and the potential for a test of US$0.8400, says
Macquarie Bank. It adds that this level corresponds to the low from last month as well as the minimum
retracement of the rally from US$0.7680 to US$0.8840, it adds. Pair is now at US$0.8552.

0018 GMT [Dow Jones] The impact of price reductions by luxury auto makers in China following
government pressure will be modest, SC Bernstein analyst Max Warburton says. This is because the
models selected by Jaguar Land Rover are high-end, low-volume ones, while Audi's cuts to aftermarket
parts will also be limited. "In China, healthy profits on new cars sales, coupled with a relatively young
premium car parc [or the number of cars and vehicles in a market] mean that the contribution from
aftermarket parts remains lower than average," Warburton says. But inevitably these latest
announcements raise questions about the risks of operating in China and the pace at which pricing and
profit per car will "normalize," he adds. (colum.murphy@wsj.com Twitter: @Colum_M)

China following pressure from the Chinese government is a "negative development that will leave
investors nervous about further government pressure and price adjustments," SC Bernstein analyst Max
Warburton says. "While we remain confident that China will remain a highly profitable and growing
market for premium OEMs, this kind of government involvement may mean that the long-assumed
'normalization' of pricing and profit per car will happen quicker than previously assumed," Warburton
writes in a note. (colum.murphy@wsj.com) Twitter: @Colum_M (colum.murphy@wsj.com) Twitter:

0003 GMT - Flight Centre (FLT.AU) has been knocked about of late, especially in the U.S., where leisure
travel has disappointed, and Australia, where consumer confidence is slack. On Friday, Flight Centre
said it would impair A$48.3 million of goodwill tied to its purchase of Liberty Travel in the U.S. in 2008.
Credit Suisse expects U.S. leisure travel to remain difficult, with corporate travel the main growth
channel. In Australia, the broker thinks Australian leisure sales fell 1% in the second half. "The
medium-term outlook for Flight Centre remains positive, in our view, driven by a dominant local market
position and building momentum offshore," Credit Suisse says. But at 15.7 times FY15 earnings, the
broker rates Flight Centre at neutral with A$50.00 price target. FLT last traded at A$46.80.

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate with a bearish bias near term after hitting a
seven-session low of $101.00/bbl on Friday before settling up two cents at $102.09/bbl, Dow Jones
technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is negative-biased as the MACD and slow
stochastic indicators are bearish, while the five-day moving average is turning downward above the
declining 15-day moving average. A drop below the $101.00 support would target the 200-day moving
average (now at $99.90), then $99.01 (July 15 reaction low), $98.91 (May 5 low), $98.74 (May 1 swing
low), and $98.25 (March 21 reaction low). But a rise above $102.53 (Friday's high) would tilt the
near-term view positive, exposing the upside to $103.34 (Wednesday's high), then to $103.45 (Tuesday's
high), $104.99 (July 21 reaction high), $105.53 (July 2 high), $106.09-$106.19 band (July 1 high-June 27
high) and $106.81 (June 26 high). September crude is down 37 cents at $101.72/bbl on Globex.

2358 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is likely to open down 0.3%, after the S&P 500 fell
0.5% following disappointing reports from Amazon and Visa. The breakdown of a cease-fire in Gaza over
the weekend, along with ongoing turmoil in Ukraine, may add to caution after the S&P/ASX 200 hit
six-year highs and gained 0.9% last week. In commodity markets, spot iron ore gained 0.7%, spot gold
added 1%, LME copper fell 0.6%, and Nymex crude oil was flat. NAB (NAB.AU) may outperform after
selling a GBP625 million basket of mainly distressed U.K. loans to private investment firm Cerberus
Global Investors, reducing the gross loans balance of the Australian lender's U.K. commercial
real-estate portfolio by 20% to GBP2.38 billion as of the end of June 2014 and reducing impaired loans
by 48%. Leighton (LEI.AU) beat first-half earnings estimates with a net profit of A$291.3 million versus
A$271 million expected by analysts, and boosted its interim dividend 27%. Index last 5583.5.
