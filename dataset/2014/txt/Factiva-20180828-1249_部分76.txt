Norton Gold Fields could be starting to see the first benefits of last year’s takeover of Kalgoorlie
Mining Company.
The prize in the acquisition was the Bullant underground mine near Ora Banda, where the
Dianmin Chen-run Norton has injected millions into development and drilling to extend the
mine’s life.

Norton’s latest exploration report reveals diamond drilling to the northern extension of the East
Lode at Bullant has returned hits of 12.7m at 11.2g/t from 54m.
The Chinese-controlled miner has also reported positive drilling results from the Wattlebird
prospect 700m north of Bullant, including 16m at 4.3g/t from 56m.
Wattlebird has reserves of just 12,000oz, but Norton says it could begin mining a small-scale
open pit before year’s end.
Norton, in which China’s biggest gold producer Zijin Mining Group holds an 82.4 per cent stake,
has shown its appetite to grow over the past year through acquisitions and exploration.
The company has a strategic land package north-west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder with 710sqkm — a
position set to expand once combined with its latest acquisition, Bullabulling Gold.
Norton’s stake in Bullabulling was 78.29 per cent yesterday after the $28 million takeover was
launched in April.
It hands Norton control of the 3.7 million ounce Bullabulling project near Coolgardie, which will
be a focus of exploration in coming years.
Norton has upped its exploration spending, with $2.6 million sunk into the ground in the June
quarter.
The expenditure was up from $2.42 million the March quarter.
