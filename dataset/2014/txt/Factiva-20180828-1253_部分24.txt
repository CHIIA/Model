Australian shares posted their best day in more than five weeks as a closely watched indicator of
business sentiment jumped and a raft of companies beat full-year earnings forecasts.

Globally, jitters over the impact on financial markets of conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza also subsided.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each jumped more than
1.3 per cent on Tuesday to 5530.3 points and 5523.1 points respectively.
Local shares remained buoyant after taking a positive lead from offshore.

"Investors in the United States and Europe fed off easing geopolitical tensions and decided to deploy
capital in recently sold-down sectors," Perpetual's Matthew Sherwood said. "Concerns about US Fed
policy were put aside given the lack of macro updates and corporate news."

National Australia Bank's monthly business conditions index jumped 6 points to a more than four-year
high of 8 points in July. NAB's measure of business confidence also improved, rising 3 points to 11
points, led by strength in retailing and home construction.

The big four banks – Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank – all pushed higher,
ahead of CBA's full-year earnings report on Wednesday.

Telstra Corporation lifted 0.9 per cent to $5.46. Australia's dominant telco continued its push into
digital media buying a $US270 million ($291.7 million) stake in video streaming and analytics
provider Ooyala.

UBS Global Asset Management's Tracey McNaughton remains underweight on Australian equities,
with an expectation that it will be difficult for local companies to deliver meaningful earnings growth
until the currency weakens. Fairly lacklustre environment "We don't expect the Aussie dollar to fall
until the US lifts interest rates, which probably won't happen until 2015," Ms McNaughton said.
"A fairly lacklustre environment for Australian company earnings growth is therefore likely to
continue, so there will be a lot of focus on outlook statements this reporting season."

Fast food franchise owner Domino's Pizza was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing
13.5 per cent to $23.39, as it delivered a 50 per cent rise in annual net profit that just beat consensus
forecasts. A dividend-hungry market gobbled up news of a 36.7¢ a share full-year dividend, up
18.8 per cent on the previous year.
Mining and earthmoving equipment supplier Bradken jumped 7.9 per cent to $4.66, despite
confirming that its full-year net profit had more than halved amid the well-documented downturn in
mining investment. Investors were heartened to learn of an uptick in orders for big-ticket machinery
in the latter half of the fiscal year.

$67.82. The spot price for iron ore, landed in China, was 0.4 per cent lower at $US95.30 a tonne.
When the ASX closed, futures trading in China was tipping another fall in the iron ore price
overnight.

Food and liquor was the worst performing sector as Woolworths lost 0.4 per cent to $35.74. Rival
Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, jumped 1.6 per cent to $43.06.
