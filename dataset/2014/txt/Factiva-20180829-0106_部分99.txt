The S&P/ASX200 was mostly in the positive all day but traded in a narrow band, closing at 5536.1, up 5.1
points after a low of 5518.8 and a high of 5548.4 - a new six year high. Volume was average for a
Monday, worth 43.6 billion. There were 407 issues higher and 614 down.

The SPI Futures closed up 10 points to 5533 points on average volume of 20,548 contracts. Aussie 10
year bond yields were down 3 points to 3.93%. The $A is at 92.90 US c, up about 15 points from early
levels.

*The banks contributed 10.3 positive points to the index, insurers contributed 0.4 negative points,
resources contributed 10 negative points, property trusts contributed 0.9 positive points, retailers
contributed 3 positive points and Telstra contributed 1 positive point.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 190 points to 14,270 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
down 27.33 points to 2009.19 points, Hang Seng futures was down 12 points to 22,163 points, S&P
futures was up 1.2 points to 1861.3, Nasdaq futures was down 0.5 points to 3530 points, Dow futures was
up 6 points to 16,330 points. Spot gold fell $1 to $1303. Crude rose 44c to $101.04.

*Plans to impose further sanctions on Russian individuals this week also weighed on markets. Reports on
news services said while rationally there should not be any major escalation of the Ukraine situation,
leaders do not always act rationally.
*Bloomberg reported China's iron ore inventory rose to the highest ever as demand to use iron ore as
collateral for credit, and as mills ramped up production in a peak season. Spot ore prices in China fell
17% this year as inventory climbed amid slowing economic growth, Bloomberg reported, weighing on the
iron ore miners.

Investors seem to be parking funds in the big banks in the hope for strong dividend payouts and in other
safe sector stocks while Australia's stable economy and distance from the Ukraine troubles also seems to
continue to attract safe haven money.

"Down about 15 . I don't think our market will post new highs (before Budget)"

"Maree" said, "The US stocks are seen as over valued. Our market may follow to a degree and finish
down about 15. I don't see a massive sell off here. On a valuation basis some may be approaching over
valuation levels, but not the general market.

"Meanwhile the Budget is now only a couple of weeks away. I don't think our market will be posting new
highs until we have a bit more clarity on the economy and how it will impact disposable income. We have
a lot happening in the market in the next fortnight".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 13.2 points to 5531points last Thursday.

NEWS OF THE DAY

*BBC News reports EU diplomats meet on Monday to agree the names of more Russians to be targeted
in a broadening of sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine.

The US and other G7 states are also planning further steps against Russia, accusing it of destabilising
Ukraine.

On Sunday, pro-Russian separatists freed a foreign observer seized in east Ukraine. Seven others are
still held.

The team was shown to the media, a move described as "revolting" by Germany - the native country of
four of them.

The group was operating under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE), which is continuing efforts to free the others.

*Japanese retail sales, reported before the Japanese market opened, rose in March at their fastest pace
in 17 years as consumers went on a shopping spree before a national sales tax hike took effect on April 1,
setting the stage for a decline in consumer spending the following month.

The 11 per cent annual increase in retail sales matched the median estimate and marked the fastest gain
since the last time the government raised the sales tax in 1997, as consumers stocked up on electronics,
toiletries and clothes to avoid paying higher prices.

*GFF: Wilmar International and First Pacific offer t/over at 65Ac per share

Goodman Fielder Ltd announced it has received a non binding, highly conditional proposal to acquire all
the issued equity in Goodman Fielder via a scheme of arrangement at a proposed price of $A65 per
share.

The proposal was received over the weekend from Wilmar International Ltd, a 10.1% shareholder of
Goodman Fielder, jointly with First Pacific Company Ltd, a Hong Kong listed investment management
company. The proposed scheme is conditional on, among other things, due diligence, unanimous
recommendation by the Board of Goodman Fielder and approval by the boards of Wilmar and First
Pacific.

Wilmar and First Pacific also requested exclusivity n relation to the proposal.

The Board of Goodman Fielder carefully considered the proposal together with its advisers and has met
with representatives of Wilmar and First Pacific over the weekend. The Board believes that the current
proposal materially undervalues GFF and is opportunistic. The Board has advised Wilmar and First Pacific
accordingly.

Our note: from Wikipedia: Wilmar (founded in Indonesia listed in Singapore): In 2012, Wilmar was named
the world's least environmentally friendly company by US news magazine Newsweek. Due to their poor
environmental performance they were excluded in 2013 from The Government Pension Fund of Norway,
the largest stock owner in Europe (mainly operates palm oil plantations and processes).
*GFF: First Pacific Company Ltd (Wilmar International Ltd and related bodies corporate) has 10.1% of
Goodman Fielder. Became substantial on April 27.

Our note: Probable reason for share price rise - picked up by the Darvas system.

*BCI: Record interim result to end December, cash in hand $148.6m

Page235of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.BC Iron Ltd for the March quarter announced the Nullagine j/v (BCI 75% FMG 25%) shipped 1.22M wet
metric tonnes of Bonnie Fines during the quarter vs guidance of 1.13M wmt (4.5Mtpa run rate).

While January experienced the fourth heaviest rainfall recorded for the month in more than 100 years at
the nearby Bonney Downs weather station as the area was impacted by Tropical Cyclone Christine and
other material rainfall events. Rainfall in February and March was below average allowing the Nullagine j/v
to catch up from the periods of downtime experienced in January.
The wet weather affected load and haul activities, resulting in increased mining of waste compared to
budget. Consequently ore mined of 0.95M dmt was lower than wet season guidance. Material from
existing stockpiles provided supplemental crusher feed with total ore crushed for the quarter of 1.05M
wmt.
Following completion of the rail and port prepayment during the previous quarter, BC Iron will report NJV
C1 cash costs going forward. The NJV's free on board C1 cash operating costs for the March quarter
were approximately $A54 per wmt shipped. C1 cash costs were above the full year 2014 guidance range
as a result of increased waste to ore ratios and fixed costs being absorbed over a lower production base
due to the wet season.
BC Iron reaffirms the NJV's C1 cash cost guidance for 2014 of between $46/50 per Wmt with costs
expected to be at the upper end of the range. C1 cash costs exclude royalties, marketing and corporate
costs.
In Brazil, an alliance between BC Iron and Cleveland Mining Company Ltd (ASX CDG) is earning up to
an 80% interest in a number of iron ore exploration projects in the Brazilian states of Bahia and Minas
Gerais. The Alliance is targeting itabirite mineralisation ranging from 30/45% Fe that is easily beneficiated
to a higher grade product.
On the corporate front, during the quarter the company released its financial results for the half year
ended December 31. The company achieved record exports of 2.46M wmt as well as record operating
cash flow of $146.7 million and record NPAT of $70.3 million and paid a 17c fully franked interim
dividend.
Cash in hand as at March 31 was $148.6 million. Total debt outstanding was $64.9 million, unaudited.

Market Cap $561m.

BCI down 15 cents to $4.52

quarter. IGO's attributable average cash costs were $531/oz Au produced. The processing plant operated
at name plate capacity.
1.9Mt of ore grading 0.6gpt Au were mined.
On the Long operation, 70,260 tonnes of ore were mined at 3.72% Ni for 2,616 tonnes of contained
nickel. The $3.80/lb payable Ni cash costs inclusive of royalties was 15% below 2014 guidance.
Year to date 207,894 tonnes of ore have been mined at 4.01% Ni for 8,344 tonnes of contained nickel.

Full year 2014 production is expected to be slightly above guidance.
At Jaguar, 115,285 tonnes of ore was mined at 13.01% Zn and 2.13% Cu. 93,728 tonnes of ore were
milled at 10.92% zn, 1.94% Cu, 149gpt Ag and 0.7gpt Au for 9,009 tonnes Zn and 1,596 tonnes Cu metal
in concentrates.

Year to date 28,551 tonnes Zn and 5,337 tonnes Cu have been produced in concentrates.

Milling was interrupted in March.
Guidance: Full year 2014 copper metal and silver production guidance is expected to be achieved. Full
year 2014 zinc metal production is expected to be approximately 10% below guidance.
Financial: Unaudited profit after tax is $20.6 million ($42.1 million year to date). A 3c interim dividend

*ACR: March qtr sales up a touch on pcp/FDA statement may impact milestone
Acrux Ltd confirmed that Eli Lilly reported Axiron net sales of $39.5 million in its financial results for the
quarter ended March 31 2014. Net sales reported by Lilly for the previous corresponding period was $37.1
million.

On January 31 2014 the US FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication which stated the FDA is
investigating the risk of stroke, heat attack (myocardial infarction) and death in men taking FDA-approved
testosterone products. The FDA has not concluded that FDA approved testosterone treatments increase
the risk of stroke, heart attack or death. The FDA stated that patients should not stop taking prescribed
testosterone products without first discussing any questions or concerns with their healthcare
professionals. The FDA assessment process does not have a defined time period.

The US testosterone replacement therapy market has been impacted and unless this improves and/or
Axiron's share of market increases the next milestone may not be met in calendar year 2014. The $50
million milestone remains payable in the first calendar year that the global sales hurdle is met.
