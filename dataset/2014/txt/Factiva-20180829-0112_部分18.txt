"Support is at 5360, resistance at 5400. I will call us up 5 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "Nasdaq again tested support levels last night but
bounced back up which was good to see, indicating the break through support was a false break. But we
need to see 4055 broken this week otherwise it is looking a bit susceptible. Ideally we would want to see it
back above 4150.

"The S&P so far for the week following the break of the 1830 support level had a good close last night,
closing not far off its highs. It is still short term neutral. For the week we would want to see it back above
1860 which would see it close above the 20 day moving average.

Page44of259©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Shanghai closed off a bit yesterday but is still holding above the 2100 level, which we need to see it hold
for now.
"Commodities got whacked last night with copper in a bit of a sell off on Comex to below $3/lb, slightly
bearish for the week. Support is still around $2.94/lb. We would want to see it back above $3.03/lb on the
week, otherwise it is susceptible to testing recent lows. The US dollar was strong across the board.
"Gold was hit quite hard last night, it pretty much gapped yesterday and is now below the 20 day moving
average. The uptrend it has been in for the last week or two has been broken. Selling pressure in coming
days may see it head back down to the previous support at $1280.

*The XJO had a pretty good day, closing right on the 20 day moving average. There is again potential for
a false break of the 20 and 50 day moving averages. We would want to see it close above 5388 for the
week. It will run into pretty strong resistance around 5400. If it breaks that level it can go to 5450.

Support is around 5360 which is also support for the day with resistance at 5400.

I will call us up 5 points.

"Resources are going to be weak, but some recovery in high p/e, high momentum stocks can push us
back into positive territory".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 29.3 points to 5388.2 last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY

NSW Premier Mr O'Farrell has resigned after a handwritten note was produced today in which he thanks
an executive from a water company for the gift of a $3000 bottle of Grange wine.The note was
addressed to Australian Water Holdings (AWH) executive Nick Di Girolamo and tendered as evidence at
ICAC this morning.

Mr O'Farrell, who was recalled to ICAC this afternoon, told the inquiry that he could not recall receiving
the bottle, even after reading his handwritten note.
In evidence yesterday, Mr O'Farrell denied receiving the wine at all, telling the inquiry: "I'm not a wine
connoisseur".
Our thought only: Premier may have fallen on his sword for little reason - if he is not a wine connoisseur
he may have had no knowledge at all of the value of his gift, merely scribbled a note of thanks as a
routine courtesy and then forgot all about it.

Our Darvas System related special report is on Goodman Fielder Ltd today, posted separately.

Changes in substantials reported April 14 and 15 inc posted separately.

LARGE CAP RESOURCES

*BHP: BHP Billiton in its report for the March quarter and 9 months said over the nine months there was
record production or four commodities and at 10 operations.
Iron ore: There was strong operating performance throughout the period, with relatively limited impact
from the wet season. The continued ramp up of Jimblebar underpinned record production at Western
Australia iron ore of 163 million tonnes on a 100% basis. Production for the quarter was 147,387Kt, up
23% from the previous corresponding period (pcp) and up 1% from the December quarter.

Year to date production was up 21% to a record 147,387 Kt.
Full year iron ore production guidance: raise by a further 5 million tonnes to 217 million tonnes on a
100% basis.
Queensland Coal: achieved record annualised production of 69 million tonnes on a 100% basis in the
March 2014 quarter.
Metallurgical coal production was up 24% year to date, up 28% on the pcp and down 1% on the
December quarter to 33,192 Kt.

Full year Queensland coal production guidance: Lifted to 43.5 million tonnes.
Total energy coal production guidance for the year: Unchanged at 73Mt.
Petroleum liquids production increased by 16% to 77 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe) for the nine
months, underpinned by a 71% increase at Onshore US.

For the nine months ended March 2014 total petroleum production rose 3% to 181.3 Mmboe.
Full year production guidance: Now expected to be approximately 245 million barrels of oil equivalent (vs
250 million barrels forecast on January 22) after the divestment of Liverpool Bay. The overall reduction in
full year guidance has been mitigated by an increased contribution from higher margin crude and
condensate.
Copper Production and Guidance: Remains unchanged at 1.7 million tonnes with a strong June 2014
quarter expected. Production for the quarter was down 5% on the pcp to 1,257.1Kt and vs the December
quarter was down 6%. Year to date copper production was up 2% to 1,257.1 Kt.
*Olympic Dam copper production for the nine months rose 10% and was underpinned by record mining
and hoisting rates. Full year production at Olympic Dam is expected to be broadly unchanged from the
2013 financial year.

ford.
Uranium production for the nine months ended March 2014 wa down 1% to 2,944 tonnes. Uranium
production was up 4% on the pcp and down 4% on the December quarter.

40%.

Forecast production:
