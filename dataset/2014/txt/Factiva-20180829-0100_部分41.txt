SHANGHAI -- Baosteel Resources Australia, a unit of China's largest steel maker Baosteel, and
Australian rail freight operator Aurizon Operations Ltd. on May 5 announced a joint all-cash offer to
acquire Aquila Resources Ltd.

The two offered to pay 3.4 Australian dollars (3.2 U.S. dollars) per share in cash, valuing the Australian
development-stage mining company at about 1.4 billion Australian dollars (1.3 billion U.S. dollars),
Baosteel said in a statement.

The cash offer represents a 38.8% premium to the closing price of 2.45 Australian dollars per share on
May 2, the last trading day prior to the announcement.

Baosteel Resources Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Baosteel Resources International Co., the
overseas resources development arm of Baosteel Group Corporation. Aurizon is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Aurizon Holdings Limited, Australia's leading bulk rail freight operator.
Baosteel Resources International Co. currently holds a 19.8% stake in Aquila.
If the acquisition goes smoothly, Baosteel Resources International will own up to 85% of Aquila and
Aurizon will own the remaining 15%, said the statement.
The acquisition is in line with Baosteel Resources International's strategy of building a leading global
resource business through the development of the West Pilbara Iron Ore Project and the Queensland
Eagle Downs Hard Coking Coal Project, it said. (XBW)
