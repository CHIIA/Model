Our market has drifted down in line with Asia on a lack of inspiration.

"High will be 5520. Low will be 5470.. close at 5491, down 27.6 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract pointing down 31 points.

"While I inferred yesterday that the move higher in US equities was just a bounce, I was still surprised that
most of the US marquee indices were able to print lower lows so soon. Whether they are headed
immediately lower or whether we will first see some more digestion of the prior losses, I am not sure.

"It was interesting that the small cap Russell 2000 managed to hold its respective low. Just a blip or a sign
that demand is starting to pick up again - we will find out soon enough.

"I believe enough technical damage has been done to inflict further losses on equities in the very near
term. As to whether the final top is in or not, the jury is still out deliberating on that front.

"None of this matters for today. The high will be 5520. The low will be 5470. When the dust has settled,
the market will have closed at 5491, down 27.6 points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 22.3 points to 5518.6 last evening.

service health club chain. Total consideration is $A342.5 million (5.27x pro forma EBITDA).
The acquisition is to be funded through an underwritten $A50 million underwritten institutional placement

stapled securities, subject to scale back.

Additional funds will primarily be utilised to accelerate the expansion of Main Event, one of the fastest
growing family entertainment businesses in the US.
Prior to any synergies with the Group's existing clubs the acquisition is expected to deliver pro forma
2015 eps and dps accretion of 3/5% based on the $A35 million raised to fund the acquisition and
associated costs.

Update on 2014 financial performance
Statutory profit is expected to be up 37.6% to $49 million on revenue up 11.3% to $499.7million.

*ABC: Buys 2 aggregates+premix concrete businesses + Penrice for $174m
Adelaide Brighton Ltd announced the acquisition of two integrated aggregates and premixed concrete
businesses located in South Australia and Queensland.
Together with the recently announced acquisition of the Penrice Quarry at Angaston, they represent a
total investment by the company of $174 million.
In South Australia, Adelaide Brighton has entered into a contract to purchase Direct Mix Concrete (DMC),
the largest independent aggregates and premixed concrete supplier to the Adelaide building, construction
and infrastructure market. DMC operates 13 concrete plants under its Direct Mix brand and operates
significant hard rock quarry and sand operations under its Southern Quarries brand. It has a strong
number two position in the Adelaide aggregates and sand market.
Adelaide Brighton has completed the acquisition of the Angaston quarry assets from Penrice. With long
term reserves in excess of 30 years, the Penrice Quarry supplies approximately 1 million tpa of high
quality industrial minerals and aggregates.
The total transaction costs for the three acquisitions is $174 million including related transaction costs,
expected to be eps accretive in 2014 and onwards. The acquisitions will be funded with existing cash and
available facilities. Post acquisition gearing is expected to be at the upper end of target range of 25/45%.

*ASL: Non cash impairment in range of $60/90 mln for year to June 30

Ausdrill Ltd advised that it has carried out a preliminary review of the carrying value of assets as at June
30 with the review including a consideration of the reasonableness of the assumptions used in these
valuations. The review is ongoing and will be completed as part of the audit of Ausdrill's annual financial
statements for 2014.
In addition to the pre-impairment expense in the company's 2014 half year results, an impairment
expense in the range of $60/90 million pre tax comprised mainly of goodwill will be required.

The impairment expense is a non cash item and does not have any impact on cashflow, will not have an
impact on operations and will not have a material impact on banking covenants with the principal
covenant affected being the gearing ratio which would increase by approximately 2% which is well within
the required limit, allowing the company to maintain a significant level of headroom under its gearing
covenant test.

*CAB: ComfortDelGro/CAB buys Blue Mtn bus service for$26.5m

Cabcharge Australia Ltd advised its associate ComfortDelGro Cabcharger Pty Ltd has entered into an
agreement to acquire the assets of the Blue mountains Bus Company (BMBC). BMBC currently operates
an Outer Metropolitan Bus Services contract in the Blue Mountains region, which joins the western fringe
of metropolitan Sydney. BMBC derives the bulk of its revenue from contract services, with the remainder
from charter.

BMBC owns 3 depots and operates a fleet of 101 buses and coaches.
The purchase consideration of $26.5 million is subject to the necessary regulatory approvals and final
due diligence. (Aug 5)

*LEP: Stat profit up 149.5%, final distrib 8.25c, rec date Jun 30/outlook positive
ALE Property Group for the year ended June 30 announced a statutory profit up 149.5% to $37.194
million on total revenue up 0.9% to $56.403 million.

Profit before income tax attributable to stapled security holders before net gain from fair value adjustments
of investment properties and derivatives, amortisation of borrowing costs and other non cash expenses
was down 1.5% to $31.232 million.

Net assets per security are $1.93 vs $1.90 last year.

Total revenue was up 0.9% as a result of lower interest income offset by higher rental income. Rent
received from properties was up 2.05%. Interest income decreased due to lower funds on deposit and
lower interest rates.

Page160of417©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Other income increased by $24.8957 million to $40.68 million due mainly to increases in fair value
increments to properties in the current year.

The final distribution is 8.25c, record date was June 30. The full year distribution of 16.45c is expected to
be 96.43% tax deferred.
Chairman Peter Warne said in the report the pubs enjoyed a healthy increase in value and the group
locked in lower credit margins and base interest rates during the year.

2015 guidance

At least 16.45c plus CPI to be paid in distribution.
$335 million AMTN refinancing ensures capital position remains strong. Maturity dates are now divesified
over the next 3, 6 and 9 years. The lower base interest rates are fixed and hedging simplified for 8.8
years.

Savings from all up interest rate of 4.35% p.a. is fixed until 2018.

Analysts expectations: $34 mln.
A leading broker on July 21 had a "lighten" on ALE Property Group with a price target of $2.71, up from
$2.51 earlier.
The broker said ALE Property Group has substantially improved its debt structure over the past couple of
months .. we still like ALE Property's long dated, trile net leases to Woolworths, its under-rented portfolio
and the strength of its management team, but we see better value elsewhere in the property sector.

regarding Woolworths pub portfolio, the broker said, "The AFR and The Australian have both reported that
ALE Property is in the running to buyWoolworths leased pubs. Based on prior statements of its
acquisition strategy, we think ALE Property would be interested in these assets, but only at the "right
price". Its cost of capital is competitive, but with real estate capital markets being dominated by asset
hungry pension and sovereign wealth funds, we think it is more likely that ALE Property will be unwilling
to pay the capitalisation rate needed to secure the assets'.
*ORI: To retain Mining Services, spin off/sell Chemicals business
Orica Ltd announced it has completed a strategic review of its Chemicals business. As a result the board
intends to pursue the separation of the chemicals businesses either by demerger or sale.
Orica's two businesses Mining Services and Chemicals are both market leaders in their respective
industries.
A separation of the businesses would allow Orica to focus on its core Mining Services activities and
capitalise on its global leadership positions in commercial explosives, ground support and sodium
cyanide.
Orica Chemicals is a leading supplier of chemical products to the mining, water treatment and other
industrial, food and cosmetics markets in Australia and New Zealand and with a growing presence in Asia
and Latin America. The annual revenue is approximately $1.2 billion. A demerger would create a
separate ASX listing for the Chemicals business.

Whilst demerger is currently the preferred approach, Orica will consider any alternatives that are in the
interests of shareholders. A further update will be provided at the full year results announcement on
November 19.

*BLG: Loss for year $2.8/3.1 million vs $1.67m last year, increase due to one off
BluGlass Ltd advised the loss for the financial year is likely to be in the order of $2.8/3.1 million vs $1.67
million operating loss last year.

The increase in operating loss for the 2014 financial year is primarily a result of the recognition, as sundry
income, of one tax research and development rebate in the 2014 financial year as compared to the
recognition of two years of R&D tax rebates in the 2013 financial year.
The company has received advice that the potential R&D tax rebate for the 2014 financial year is likely to
be in the vicinity of $2/2.25 million vs $4.2 million recognised as tax rebates in the 2013 financial year.

September or early October 2014. This compares to the $4.2 million recognised as tax rebates in the
2013 financial year, relating to the 2012 and 2013 financial years. (Aug 5)
