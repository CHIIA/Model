EXCLUSIVE FORMER Nathan Tinkler lieutenant Hamish Collins is looking to capitalise on his old
boss’s demise, having grabbed a north Queensland Tinkler copper-zinc project for next to nothing
from administrators and, with the backing of former Tinkler creditors and Queensland’s wealthy Millner
family, is working to have a mine plan in place next year.
Mr Collins was chief executive of the Tinkler-controlled listed coal companyAston Resources, which
housed the Maules Creek coal project and which was taken over in 2012 by Whitehaven Coal.

But a lesser-known part of the old Tinkler empire, copper interests near Mt Isa owned by the privately
held Aston Metals, has again drawn in Mr Collins.

Through Aeon Metals — the Sydney-based junior he now runs — he has bought Aston’s Walford
Creek copper project from the administrator for just $10.

The catch is that former Tinkler creditor Orchard Capital — now OCP Holdings — has taken a 16 per
cent stake in Aeon.
And if Aeon has not paid back $20 million of what was $25m of debt owed in the next three years,
OCP gets the project.

“We think the market will turn in that time,” Mr Collins said in Melbourne yesterday. “This (Walford
Creek) is probably the best copper-zinc project in Australia, in terms of size and quality.” Aeon, in
which the Millner-controlled Washington H Soul Pattinson has an 8 per cent stake, leveraged Mr
Collins’ knowledge of Walford Creek to strike a deal with OCP, the senior secured creditor, to continue
proving up the project. The acquisition was finalised in June.

As happened with many of Mr Tinkler’s employees and business partners, Mr Collins fell out with the
former tycoon as the empire crumbled under its huge debt.

Mr Collins sued Whitehaven for $188m over Maules Creek and the pair settled for an undisclosed sum
last year.
Shares in Aeon, which also has copper projects near Gladstone, doubled after the acquisition,
pushing the junior’s market value to $80m. But the rally was not sustained in the past month, when
continued negative market sentiment brought the shares back down to where they traded before the
acquisition. If all goes to plan, and using $8m from a recent raising, Aeon hopes to continue drilling
that will prove up a resource at the prospect and support a pre-feasibility study by the end of next year.
Walford Creek, sold to Aston (as Mr Collins searched for copper assets for Mr Tinkler) by Tom Eadie’s
Copper Strike, is a Western Mining discovery near the soon to be closed Century zinc mine.Century
is run by the Melbourne-based, Hong Kong-listed, Chinese-controlled MMG Resources. Development
of the project using Century infrastructure would appear a logical move, though Mr Collins says so far
there have been no discussions between Aeon and MMG.
