All hail the metal of the future.

Headline-grabbing announcements from the likes of Ford Motor, which is using aluminum to lighten the
latest version of its F-150 truck, have highlighted the metal's lightweight, malleable qualities.

Meanwhile, ultracheap money available for financing trades has kept aluminum piled up in warehouses.
That has pushed up the premiums over London Metal Exchange prices paid by customers actually
wishing to get their hands on physical metal. Aluminum producers have benefited: shares in Alcoa,
which reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings this week, are up more than 40% this
year.

That should be good news for Rio Tinto, the world's second largest producer of aluminum by volume
which has had a torrid time in that business since its ill-timed acquisition of Alcan for $38 billion in
2007. Investors hoping to reap the benefit of that, however, may find it is already priced into the stock.

Rio's aluminum business has been improving. The miner has written down the value of these assets by
some $30 billion since the Alcan deal. The division produced better-than-expected earnings last year, at
$557 million--thanks to $574 million in pretax cost cuts. Meanwhile, a 10% price increase in average
aluminum prices would have added about $550 million to Rio's overall earnings last year, or about 5%.

But the near-term outlook for aluminum still isn't clear-cut. Rule changes around LME warehousing
arrangements or rising interest rates could free up warehoused metal, prompting prices to fall. And even
with the hype around aluminum cars, it will take time for demand growth to eat into global inventories.
With China largely self-sufficient, older smelting capacity elsewhere must close to keep supply in check
as more efficient plants start up.

Rio investors must await more details from new divisional boss Alfredo Barrios of his plans. Those could
include more cost cutting and potentially shifting Rio's focus away from producing aluminum toward the
higher-margin mining of bauxite, the critical raw ingredient for the metal that China lacks.

Meanwhile, it isn't clear that Rio is being egregiously shortchanged on its aluminum business.

Alcoa, which has built a downstream business making specialist products for sectors such as aerospace
and defense, trades on about seven times 2015 Ebitda. Putting the same multiple on Rio's business,
which is more focused upstream on mining bauxite and producing aluminum, suggests a value of about
$15 billion, based on Morgan Stanley's forecasts. That would leave Rio's remaining business, which
makes most of its money in iron ore, trading at about 6.2 times--in line with closest rival BHP Billiton.

Aluminum's years in the Rio doghouse are coming to an end. But Rio looks like it is already getting a
decent enough price for a business still being bashed into shape.
