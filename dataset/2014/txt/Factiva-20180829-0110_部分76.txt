"Support is now at 5390, next level of resistance 5435 .. I'll call us up 15"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "Nasdaq closed right on its highs last night which is very
encouraging. It has broken through the resistance level at 4055. It is still in downtrend from its high back on
the 7th of March, but if it can break back and close above 4135 over the coming week it's potentially going
to be short term neutral. Its good to see the 4000 level hold after being tested for the last 3 days.
"Copper looks like it was potentially a false break yesterday but we need to see it above $3.05/lb and
finish there for the week. Support is at $3, resistance is at $3.05.
*Gold entered a short term uptrend this week but yesterday's move and last night's move confirmed a
break down. It has broken through the 20 day moving average and is technically heading back towards the
previous support of $1280, then $1250.

*The S&P 500 closed on its highs, breaking back above the 1860 level which was resistance, and also
where the 20 day moving average was sitting with a strong close. It is back in the range where it was all
through late February and March. The picture there is neutral at the moment. Any break out through 1875
and we will see 1890 tested again.

*Our market had a very strong day yesterday, closing pretty much on its highs.

We also broke back above the 20 day moving average and are not far from resistance at 5424. The next
strong test is 5450. We are also back in the uptrend channel.

"If the US can hold we look to test the next level of 5435, then 5450 and can head back to 5500 if 5450 is
broken. Support is now at 5390.

Page212of283©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."For the day given we had a strong day yesterday, some of last night's overseas move has been factored
in. I'll call us up 15 points'. .
