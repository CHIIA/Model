0310 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian resources are being viewed more favorably due to improving China
economic data, strong quarterly production reports and stretched valuations in high-yield stocks such as
banks. "Iron-ore prices aren't going back up to their highs, but they aren't going to US$50 a ton either
because I think the worst is over in terms of China destocking, and China's economic growth has
stabilized," Pengana portfolio manager Tim Schroeders says. "We've seen value in resources for a long
time and we've been selectively buying over the last little while." But he doesn't expect the S&P/ASX 200
to surge, as investors may switch from banks to resources. The S&P/ASX 200 is up 0.4% at 5542 after
hitting a 6-year high of 5561.1. Spot iron ore was flat at US$98.00. It hit a record high of US$191.90 in
Feb 2011 and a 2-year low of US$89.00 in June. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0300 GMT [Dow Jones] The longer Singapore's electronics shipments remain soft, the longer total export
data will remain weak, says OCBC treasury research and strategy analyst Selena Ling. Responding to
weaker-than-expected non-oil export numbers published early Thursday, Ling says electronics were the
main drag on the headline figures. Total export growth has been disappointing for the first half of 2014, at
-2.2%, she says. "Currently, the Singapore export plane is flying with only one engine, namely the
non-electronics, working at this junction." OCBC forecasts a 1.5% contraction in full-year 2014 exports,
compared with a larger fall of 6% in 2013. The country's exports fell 4.6% year-on-year in June.

0300 GMT [Dow Jones] Korea's new finance minister Choi Kyung-hwan says the government will use
"diverse fiscal tools during the second half" to accelerate growth even while he rules out a supplementary
budget this year, thus increasing speculation of a rate cut. The market reacted with a USD/KRW rise
above 1030, while ten-year treasury bond yields fall to their lowest levels since May 2013. But
economists are unconvinced: "Mr. Choi's dismissal of a supplementary budget reduces the likelihood of a
BoK policy interest rate cut," says ING. "We infer from his comments that Mr. Choi views structural
problems as the main impediments to growth and that fixing them is beyond the scope of cyclical
financial policy. We think most of the BoK MPC agrees," ING adds. DBS agrees, saying structural
reforms are more likely than rate cuts. The Kospi is up 0.5% at 2022.89.(gregor.hunter@wsj.com;

0257 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei is up 0.2% at 15,409.35 midday, paring some earlier gains. Takashi
Hiratsuka, a trading group leader at asset-management division of Resona Bank, says there are many
factors supporting Japanese stocks--improved earnings of Japanese companies, continued easing from
the Bank of Japan, flows from domestic and foreign investors--but the index's rising momentum isn't that
strong. He says the JPY's relative strength on the back of declines in Treasury and euro-zone bond
yields and some overheating in U.S. high tech stocks are making investors cautious in buying more
Japan stocks. The EUR/JPY falls to 137.37--the lowest in more than five months.

the comparison time periods used in the survey. The item should have said the Australian business
confidence was resilient in 2Q considering the tough Federal Budget in May, though National Australia
Bank's business confidence index slipped to +6 in 2Q vs +7 in 1Q. NAB's current business conditions
index rose to +1 in 2Q from flat in 1Q.

0234 GMT [Dow Jones] Qantas Airways (QAN.AU) appears to be flying into a muted earnings recovery
thanks to an improving domestic market and partial success of its cost-cutting program, says UBS. It
forecasts that improved local market from about mid FY15 along with a cut of 7% in staff numbers should
drive a near break-even outcome for the airline in FY15, rising to a profit of about A$300 million in FY16
and to A$500 million the year after. Still, the current tough market conditions are expected to drive an
underlying pretax loss of about A$700 million for FY14. UBS has a neutral stance and lifts its price
target to A$1.30/share from A$1.20. QAN is trading up 0.2% at A$1.2475. (robb.stewart@wsj.com;

0231 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are slightly lower early Thursday, continuing a correction from
Wednesday's close as losses among the previously strong start-up stocks hit sentiment in the broader
market. The Shanghai Composite is last down 0.7% to 2053.85. The ChiNext Price Index, tracking
smaller, often technology related firms, is last down 0.4% to 1312.80, continuing losses from early July.
"As long as economic data doesn't exceed expectations, it's not doing anything to lift the market...
meanwhile the ChiNext is correcting after steep rises earlier in the year," says Deng Wenyuan, analyst
with Soochow Securities. The latest data shows growth accelerating slightly in Q2, growing 7.5% from a
year earlier. The Shenzhen Index is down 0.7% to 1098.01.(chao.deng@wsj.com; Twitter @chao_deng)

0223 GMT [Dow Jones] Reopening after the one-day market closure due to the typhoon that swept
Manila, USD/PHP appears to be stable near its Tuesday close of 43.61 having avoided the broad spike
of the U.S. dollar in Asia Wednesday. A technical consolidation range for USD/PHP spanning
43.45-43.63 is likely to trap the pair Thursday. On a Thursday close below 43.45, the daily Bollinger
downtrend channel will come into play, suggesting more room for the peso to rise versus the U.S. dollar
in the near term. Analysts are still keeping a hawkish watch on the Philippine central bank which has
repeatedly hinted that interest rates could rise--despite recently reduced inflation readings. USD/PHP is
now 43.56 from its Tuesday close of 43.61. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0220 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are higher in thin volume, mostly reflecting overnight
gains in U.S. Treasurys, says a local trader. "Many bond investors turned cautious about pushing bond
prices much higher as they want cues from the new 20-year bond auction on July 28," the trader says.
The most-traded five-year bond yield is at 1.2080% vs 1.2135% late Wednesday; the trader tips expects
yield to trade between 1.2000% and 1.2200% for the session. The 10-year bond yield is at 1.6205% vs
1.6230% Wednesday. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0218 GMT [Dow Jones] Spot NZD/JPY hits a three-week low of 88.24 Thursday as soft inflation data out
of New Zealand and weak dairy prices continue to weigh on the antipodean currency. Dow Jones
technical analysis shows NZD/JPY short-term technical outlook is negative as the five-day moving
average has fallen below the 15-day moving average; the rate-of-change momentum indicator is
declining in negative territory; the daily slow stochastic measure is falling from overbought levels; and the
negative MACD histogram bars are expanding. Spot NZD/JPY in the near term looks set to reach 88.20
(38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 85.79-89.69 May 29-July 10 advance). A drop below 88.20 would
open the way down to 87.74 (50.0% Fibonacci retracement), and then to 87.28 (61.8% Fibonacci
retracement). Spot NZD/JPY was recently at 88.29. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0212 GMT [Dow Jones] A survey of bank lending practices released by the Bank of Japan on Thursday
shows demand for loans from individuals fell sharply in the past three months to early July, as their
rushed purchases of houses and related-borrowing wore off following a hike in April. The index
measuring such demand turned minus 10 from plus 20 in the previous April survey. A figure in the
negative territory means there are more banks responding that customer demand for loans declined.
Meanwhile, the index measuring demand from corporations is plus 5, unchanged from the previous
survey. Still, a lack of improvement may be discouraging for the BOJ, which hopes that firms will boost
fresh spending, rather than hoarding cash, to keep the economy on a moderate recovery track.

0209 GMT [Dow Jones] Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd.'s (5802.TO) announcement Wednesday that it
will sell its 25% stake in Sumitomo3M to 3M Co.(MMM) is a positive development for Sumitomo Electric,
says Yuji Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities. "The selling price of Y90 billion is equivalent to
around 20 times the Y4 billion--5 billion equity-method income that Sumitomo3M normally provides,"
he says. Sumitomo Electric raised its net profit projection to Y111 billion from Y70 billion to reflect Y44
billion special gains on the sale of Sumitomo3M. Sumitomo Electric's shares are currently up 1.3% at
Y1,499. (Megumi.Fujikawa@wsj.com)
