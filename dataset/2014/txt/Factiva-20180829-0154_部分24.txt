STOCKS
The sharemarket ended the week on a negative note in thin trading after major global equity
markets kicked off 2014 lower following the release of disappointing Chinese factory activity data on
New Year's Day.

On Friday, the S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 18.2 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5349.7 in a broad sell-off that
included the biggest banking and resource stocks. Over the week, which included the New Year's
holiday, the benchmark index rose 0.4 per cent with metals and mining stocks leading the gains.

Price movements were exaggerated by low volumes as the total value of shares traded over the
week was about $956 million, compared to an average weekly turnover of about $3.64 billion in
the first three weeks of December.
Overseas markets fell on Thursday after major indices in the US, Europe and Asia fell after China's
National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index dipped 0.4 per cent in December to 51
points, its lowest reading in four months, indicating a contraction in global demand.

"Another issue that could be providing investors with some pause is rising 10-year US bond yields,
currently around 3 per cent," said CMC Markets analyst Ric Spooner.

"One of the key issues for markets over coming months will be whether the US Federal Reserve can
exit from its quantitative easing strategy without pushing bond yields too high and so dampening the
outlook for economic and profit growth."

Three of the big four banks lost ground on Friday, with Commonwealth Bank down 0.3 per cent to
$77.58, NAB 0.4 per cent at $34.69 and ANZ 1¢ to $32.21. Westpac was unchanged at $32.34.

An HSBC proxy for the International Monetary Fund's primary commodity price index reported that
global commodity prices increased by 3.5 per cent in US dollar terms through December, and were
up 2.4 per cent in 2013.
"Higher energy prices provided a boost, with oil and natural gas prices rising in 2013, while cereals
were a key area of weakness," HSBC economist Adam Richardson said.

"In 2013 Australia's commodity price basket fell 4.1 per cent in US dollar terms, although a lower
currency helped the index rise 11.7 per cent year-on-year in Australian dollar terms."

At the local close on Friday the dollar was buying US89.86¢, up from US89.13¢.
Energy stocks were mostly lower after crude oil prices dipped following news Libya is to re-open a
major oilfield, increasing global supply.

dropped 1.1 per cent to $38.13. On Thursday the company announced it had lost a multibillion
dollar contract to sell 1.5 million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas to Japan.

The news that Woodside had lost its offtake partners following plans to move its proposed
processing plant offshore was negative for a range of smaller resources services companies that will
be in the running for contracts if the Browse floating LNG project proceeds.

Labour contractor Skilled Group was the worst-performing stock, dumping 7 per cent to $3.21.
Mermaid Marine, the largest supplier of marine logistics and services to the offshore oil and gas
industry, dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25. Engineering services contractor Cardno lost 3.8 per cent to
$6.85.

BHP Billiton fell 1.1 per cent to $37.77, e Rio Tinto fell 0.5 per cent to $68.36, and Fortescue Metals
dropped 1.9 per cent to $5.82 as surface mining resumed at its Christmas Creek project four days
after a man was killed in an accident while working at the site.
Coal explorer Carabella Resources was flat at 44¢ as the company directors recommended
shareholders accept an off-market takeover from Chinese-owned Wealth Mining for 45.5¢ per
share.

Silver Lake Resources was the best-performing stock for the second day in a row, climbing 8.7 per
cent to 69¢ as the spot price of gold rose to $US1231.05 per ounce. Australia's biggest goldminer,
Newcrest Mining, added 2.6 per cent to $8.67 despite the risk of a looming shareholder class
action.

Cabcharge dropped 3.5 per cent to $3.87 after news that a surcharge for paying by card will be
halved.
