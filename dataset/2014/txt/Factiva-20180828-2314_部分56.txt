0344 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Bank says the overall exposure of Australian household and bank
balance sheets to housing-sector risk is manageable, despite some pockets of emerging stress in
Sydney and Melbourne. Deutsche Bank points to recent comments by the banking regulator that recent
stress tests conducted on 13 large, locally incorporated banks that centered on a severe downturn in the
housing market showed positive results. DB said the stress tests suggested that the domestic impact
would certainly be material but not of the scale seen overseas. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0342 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia's stock of foreign currency reserves will likely remain over $100 billion
in 2014, significantly above the $47.9 billion trough during the recent global financial crisis and the 2013
low of $85.9 billion, says Moody's in its latest update on Indonesia. Bank Indonesia has been very
careful in using its foreign exchange reserves by reducing intervention to defend the rupiah. The reserves
were $112 billion end of October. The ratings company, which rates Indonesia Baa3 with stable outlook
says things that could lead to a rating upgrade include increased fiscal space resulting from improved
revenue collection or a lower subsidy bill, expectations of continued improvement in the macro-economic
balance, reflected in balance of payments, inflation and the financial system metrics, continued progress
in addressing infrastructure bottlenecks that contribute to an increase in potential growth, a deepening of
local capital and credit markets to support domestic financing of government deficits.

0338 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/CNY is largely steady after the dollar climbed against most of its rivals
Monday. The USD/CNY is at 6.1192, compared with Monday's closing of 6.1196. Traders say gains in
the Chinese yuan will be limited as the government has started pump priming to stimulate the economy.
Meanwhile it's just a matter of time before the Fed raises interest rates. "Growth in China's international
reserves will trend slower. The macro situation doesn't support yuan appreciation," says a trader at a
local bank. He expects the USD/CNY to consolidate in range of 6.11-6.13 for the rest of the year. The
People's Bank of China sets the USD/CNY central parity rate at 6.1413, up from Monday's 6.1377.
Offshore, one-year USD/CNY NDFs are up at 6.2660/6.2680 from 6.2560/6.2580 late Monday.

0336 GMT [Dow Jones] The lowest accepted price for 30-year Japanese government bonds in a
planned announcement of auction results at 0345 GMT will likely come to 104.35-40, traders say. The
sale is a reopen of the 1.7% coupon No. 44 issue. "We expect that there will be enough demand at
today's auction to absorb the supply," say Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities economists, due to

month. Lead December JGB futures are down 0.09 at 146.46. (eleanor.warnock@wsj.com)

0334 GMT [Dow Jones] Thailand's SET is likely to extend this year's strong performance in 2015, rising
an additional 7% as the new government ushers more reform measures, Nomura says in a note.
"Thailand is heading for a major overhaul via reforms in 2015. We expect the country to come out in a
much better shape than the one entering the political crisis in year-end 2013," the research house says.
Nomura likes Thailand's positive GDP momentum over the next few quarters despite a weak
performance this year. But Nomura warns that the market "is no longer cheap." It says investors should
focus more on the beneficiaries of public spending on infrastructure--such as Siam Commercial Bank
(SCB.TH) and Siam Cement (SCC.TH)--and the recovery of other demand-led sectors like consumption
and retail, in which it prefers companies like CP All (CPALL.TH). Among tourism picks, it likes Airports of
Thailand (AOT.TH). (jake.watts@wsj.com; @jmwatts_)

0335 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian interest rate futures market pricing has dialled down the pessimism
over the past week or so, from pricing a 40% chance of 25 basis point rate cut by September 2015 to just
a 25% chance now, says Annette Beacher, economist at TD Securities. "We see the Reserve Bank of
Australia on hold at 2.5% with scant risk of a cut short of a global shock, but at least the RBA has a cash
rate to cut if necessary," she said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0332 GMT [Dow Jones] The National Australia Bank has revised higher its forecast for Australian gross
domestic product growth in 2014/15 to 2.9% from 2.8% prior. It said a record jump in Australian business
conditions in October points to strong start to the fourth quarter but it also warns that growth is still
constrained by weak terms of trade, a soft labor market and signs of a softening in the building cycle.

0331 GMT [Dow Jones] Asia as a region totally dominates Saudi Arabia's oil export flows with a 71%
market share, or 5.1 million barrels/day out of total crude exports of 7.2 million barrels/day this year,
Societe Generale's head of oil research Michael Wittner says. "Flows to the U.S. and Europe are small
and slowly eroding, and just don't matter that much," he says. He also says that despite the fall in prices
last week, crude and petroleum-product demand is increasing seasonally. Oil refineries in all three key
regions of the U.S., Europe and Asia are coming out of maintenance and starting to ramp up operations
ahead of winter; and heating fuel demand is also beginning to pick up, he says. Nymex WTI crude is
down 14 cents at $77.26/bbl, Brent crude is down 28 cents at $82.06/bbl. (eric.yep@wsj.com)

0310 GMT [Dow Jones] The ringgit could slip to 3.3550 versus the U.S. dollar on an intraday basis, the
daily USD/MYR chart suggests. The bullish technical bias for the dollar was maintained by Monday's
closing above the 3.3200 base of the Bollinger uptrend channel. The gradient of the channel has now
steepened, raising the chart support for USD/MYR to 3.3250. The pair, currently at 3.3400 versus its
Monday close of 3.3295, could mark a new high for 2014 if it surpasses 3.3465. The U.S. dollar is back
up across the board Tuesday after a bout of weakness seen yesterday. Apart from underlying yen
weakness due to Bank of Japan's easing measures, the slide in gold and oil prices is another factor
boosting the greenback. Malaysia releases its September industrial production index at 0401 GMT.

0305 GMT [Dow Jones] SJM (0880.HK) may cut its dividend as costs rises and earnings drop, says
Deutsche Bank. The Macau gaming operator reported Monday a drop in earnings for the third quarter,
due to lower margins. "The other four operators all reported margin expansion in the third quarter," says
Deutsche, which downgrades the stock to sell and cuts its target price to HK$13.5. "This highlights SJM's
inability to protect margin when competition intensifies." As labor costs in Macau rise, Deutsche says
SJM's capital expenditure may further increase from its current budget, hampering the company's
cashflow. SJM falls 2.0% to HK$15.04 Tuesday. (jacky.wong@wsj.com; Twitter: @jackycwong)

0303 GMT [Dow Jones] Residential property prices in Australia are up by 9.1% on the year,
representing a slowdown from prior quarters, according to government data. "Today's figures are a
welcome addition to the suite of home price data which show that price growth is easing to a much more
sustainable rate," Shane Garrett, senior economist at the Housing Industry Association, says. "The
annual rate of home price growth nationally is back in single figures for the first time in a year," Garrett
says. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Iron ore prices, now around $75 a metric ton, need to fall into the $60s to start
significant output curtailments outside of China, Citi said. "We find only modest cutbacks are likely if iron
ore remains in the $70s, with sustained prices in the $60s needed to prompt significant cutbacks," it said.
Supply expansion from a handful of major global iron-ore miners is threatening to push out marginal,
high-cost producers from the field. Domestic Chinese iron ore production remains resilient, though it will
also come under pressure, the note said. Chinese steel demand is likely to weaken in the first quarter
next year due to tight credit, slower manufacturing growth and government reform, Citi said.
