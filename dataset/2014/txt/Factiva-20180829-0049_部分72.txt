FINANCE PET CARE COMPANY EXPANDS INTO WA
SYDNEY - The company behind Petbarn stores and Greencross vets is expanding into Western
Australia with a $205 million takeover of petcare retailer City Farmers.

Greencross' purchase of City Farmers from private equity owners will add 42 stores to its network,
taking its total number to 177, plus 108 vet clinics.
The company also said sales in its Petbarn business had grown by 6.9 per cent so far this financial
year, and by six per cent in its Greencross vet clinics.

Greencross will fund its takeover of City Farmers by offering new shares to the former owners, existing
Greencross shareholders and institutional investors.

MORE ACTION AHEAD FOR MINERAL RESOURCES AND AQUILA
SYDNEY - Mining contractor Mineral Resources looks set to make another move on iron ore explorer
Aquila Resources.
Aquila is the target of $1.4 billion takeover bid from Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and rail operator
Aurizon, as they look to kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project in Western
Australia.
Last week Mineral Resources bought a near $200 million, 13 per cent stake in Aquila Resources, in a
bid to deal itself into the large-scale iron ore project.
Another purchase of shares looks likely, with shares in Mineral Resources and Aquila halted from
trade on Monday ahead of an announcement from each company regarding "a potential corporate
transaction".
