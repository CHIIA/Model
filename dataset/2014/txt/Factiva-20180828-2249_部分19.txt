SYDNEY -- Investors in giant gas-export terminals from Australia to Canada are facing the prospect of
losing billions of dollars plowed into the projects as plunging oil prices darken the outlook for the
industry.

Unless prices recover, the decline could wipe out returns for companies such as Chevron Corp. and
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which have committed nearly $250 billion combined to liquefied-natural-gas
projects over the past seven years to meet rising Asian demand for the cleaner-burning fuel.

LNG is natural gas compressed into liquid form inside huge refrigeration units, making it possible to
ship it on tankers to places unconnected by pipelines.

To fund their plans, the companies have typically agreed to sell most of the gas up front, ahead of the
completion of their projects, at rates linked to oil prices. The oil-linked pricing means LNG producers
stand to get much less revenue when they deliver their first shipments than if crude had remained
nearer its peak of $116 some six months ago. On Thursday, Brent crude, the global oil-price
benchmark, was near $64 a barrel in European trading.

Already, the decline has claimed a casualty in Canada. Last week, developers led by Malaysia's
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, indefinitely delayed starting construction of a $32 billion LNG
plant on the Pacific coast.

Crude futures have been weakening for months, but declines accelerated last month following a
decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain its production limits,
despite concern over a glut of oil.
LNG prices in Asia have sunk below $10 per million British thermal units, meaning many of the
projects may struggle to turn a profit. "OPEC's come along and burst the bubble," said Mark Samter, a
Sydney-based analyst at Credit Suisse. "Project returns are awful at these prices."

To break even, most Australian LNG projects would need to sell the commodity for at least $12-to-$14
per million British thermal units, according to estimates from Credit Suisse and Wood Mackenzie, a
resource-industry consultancy. The price would need to be even higher for some of the more-expensive
developments.

To be sure, most experts believe demand for LNG will soar over the coming decades as countries such
as China attempt to drive their modernization using fuel that burns more cleanly than coal. Demand for
LNG will also likely remain high in economies such as South Korea and Japan, which lack fossil-fuel
reserves. Japan has been using more LNG since the 2011 Fukushima disaster prompted it to close its
nuclear reactors.
Typically, LNG is sold through contracts spanning up to 30 years. A swift recovery in the oil price could
allow projects to make money eventually, if their owners can withstand the financial pressure long
enough. Santos Ltd., a big investor in Australian LNG, has been forced to cut spending across its
business after the fall in oil prices prompted it to defer raising cash through a sale of so-called hybrid
securities.

overruns caused by everything from unfavorable currency swings to labor shortages. The challenges
are different for producers in Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar, where labor costs are lower.
On the east coast of Australia, U.K. oil-and-gas companyBG Group PLC is running last-minute checks
before starting up a vast facility that cost more than $20 billion to build, having overcome budget
overruns of more than a third of the original price tag. The project -- clustered on an island with two
giant plants owned by rivals including Santos, Total SA and ConocoPhillips -- is due to ship its first LNG
cargoes to Asia this month.

BG said it remained optimistic about the prospects for its Queensland Curtis LNG project, which counts
China's Cnooc Ltd. as a minority investor and a key customer. "The economics for QCLNG are sound
and competitive across a wide range of oil prices," a BBG spokesman said.
The company bolstered its balance sheet this week by selling the project's main pipeline to Australia's
APA Group Ltd. for $5 billion.

On the country's west coast, the cost of building the Gorgon LNG project, operated by Chevron with
backing from Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp., has already swelled by around 45% to $54 billion since
building started in 2009. The work is expected to be completed sometime next year, when the project is
also supposed to come online. A spokesman for Chevron declined to comment on the weakening oil
price, but Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said in October that four major projects it is building,
including Gorgon, would rapidly turn from being "cash consumers" to "cash generators."

"Clearly, many Australian projects are at risk of delivering inadequate returns," said Ian Ashcroft, a
U.K.-based gas analyst at Wood Mackenzie. "Some are already suffering due to cost overruns, but the
impact of the oil price on early cash flow is also critical to project economics."

Elsewhere, companies that haven't started building dozens more planned LNG terminals in Canada
and East African countries such as Tanzania and Mozambique will likely be questioning the timing of
hundreds of billions of dollars in proposed new investments.
U.S. shale-gas producers looking to export their product are affected less by the drop in oil prices
because they typically signed contracts overseas linked to U.S. domestic-gas prices, which are low due
to the boom in the local production of shale gas. But on the flip side, thanks to crude oil's fall, LNG
producers offering oil-linked contracts will be able to compete better in the international market against
their U.S. rivals.

Currently, two LNG terminals are under construction in the U.S. Several more have received the
go-ahead from regulators. Construction of the Sabine Pass project in Louisiana, operated by
Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc., began two years ago and is expected to be completed late next
year. Freeport LNG Development LP last month began a project in Texas; it expects to begin shipping
gas in 2018.

Both projects involve converting LNG import terminals into export facilities. They are expected to be
less expensive than the Australian ones because pipelines and storage tanks are already in place.
Cheniere declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Freeport said it had signed contracts that
would absorb its plant's projected output for decades.
