2237 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Pressure on the Australian dollar is likely to continue to build, putting its status
as the only G-10 currency that is stronger against the U.S. this year at risk, says Capital Economics. It is
forecasting the currency to end 2014 at US$0.87, and finish 2015 at US$0.85, compared with a current
level of around US$0.91. "A key reason why we expect the exchange rate to decline is the relative
prospects for monetary policy in the U.S. and Australia," Capital Economics says. The U.S. Federal
Reserve is likely to tighten a little more aggressively than most envisage as a strengthening labor market
puts upward pressure on wage inflation. In Australia, the central bank is set to keep interest rates at
2.5% into 2016, it says. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

18:25 EDT - Indonesian President-elect Joko Widodo plans to develop poor villages in the first three
months of his term in part by giving fishermen, farmers and others access to capital and building diesel
fuel stations that will help the government better distribute subsidized fuel, his team says. Hasto
Kristiyanto, a member of Widodo's transition team says the new administration will pay for the
anti-poverty efforts in 1,000 villages by reallocating the budget and using CSR programs. He adds that
the administration plans to disburse cash aid for students up to grade 12. Widodo assumes office in
October with a budget that allocates billions of dollars to fuel subsidies, and has suggested he would
cut subsidies to make room for welfare spending. (linda.silaen@wsj.com)

18:22 EDT - Asian markets are likely to be mixed, tracking the US, where investors eyed tensions in Iraq
and Ukraine as well as the recent rise in long-term interest rates. In New Zealand the NZX-50 is down
0.2% at 5250.356. The Warehouse (WHS.NZ) is down 0.3% at NZ$3.08 after reporting a sharp drop in
its net profit, though volume is light as the result was "as expected and within the range forecast by
analysts," says Forsyth Barr broker Dave Schaper. Investors will be watching for earnings reports from
other retailers, he says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)
17:48 EDT - China's dominance in the cotton market faded today as the USDA forecast India's
production would outpace China's for the first time since at least the mid-1960s. Indian growers will likely
reap 30M bales this season, compared with China's 29.5M, federal forecasters say in a monthly report.
In addition to its own lower production, China may be finding that it may not need as much US cotton
either. China cancelled 105,900 bales of US upland cotton, bringing net sales cancellations in the week
ended Sept. 4 to 34,200 bales, the largest since June 2012, according to USDA.

17:07 EDT - AUD/USD "remains in a negative mood, despite decent economic data," says Westpac
Bank senior strategist Imre Speizer. "The strong US dollar is dominating and puts 0.9080 (and) below at
risk." The pair is at 0.9100 early in New Zealand. Looking further ahead, he says the RBA is expected to
remain on hold until August 2015, but markets should start pricing in the tightening cycle by end-2014,
which should eventually boost AUD above 0.9500. "Before then though, US dollar sentiment and
commodity prices will dominate and could drag the AUD to 0.9050." (rebecca.howard@wsj.com;

16:47 EDT - Canadian monthly jobs data are well known for their volatility, sometimes doing one thing
when it was expected to do another and often catching economists off-guard. It seems Canada has
company Down Under: the Australian jobs report overnight showed a 121k record gain in August.
Relative to the size of its workforce, that's comparable to a 179k gain in Canada and a 1.5M jump in the

Canadian and US household survey figures. (nirmala.menon@wsj.com; @NirmalaMenon)

16:41 EDT - NZD/USD continues to move lower "with the 0.8200 level broken on the back of a much
more cautious RBNZ," says BNZ FX strategist Raiko Shareef. He notes the USD rally continues to be
the "defining feature of the FX landscape" and AUD's failure to hold gains following a strong Australia
employment report also weighed on the kiwi. NZD/USD last at 0.8178. Shareef says any rally is likely
limited to 0.8250. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

16:33 EDT - Call it ageist, but younger sugar-cane can yield more sugar. That's a problem for Brazilian
sugar producers: they are faced with sugar prices at more than 4-year lows, heavy debt loads and higher
costs. Jeremy Austin, general manager of trade house Sucres et Denrees Group's Brazil unit, says only
about 14% of the cane has been renovated this year, when 18% a year should be replanted with new
cane. "It's very difficult to find people who are making money in the Brazilian sugar industry," he says.
"We see that [the cane] is just getting older." ICE raw-sugar futures end at 14.36c/lb, lowest since June
2010. (leslie.josephs@wsj.com; @lesliejosephs)

16:26 EDT - Public investment spending in Mexico has not translated in more infrastructure yet, says
Barclays, noting that its 2.5% growth forecast for this year is facing downside pressures. "Manufacturing
continues to be the motor of industrial production, while construction might not get enough dynamism
during the rest of the year," writes Marco Oviedo, Barclays Mexico's chief economist. Industrial
production expanded 0.3% in July compared to the previous month, slightly below expectations.
Mexico's government has an unprecedented $65B in physical investments approved for this year.

15:37 EDT - A combination of a stronger greenback and softer commodity prices has driven USD/CAD
to the highest level in almost 5 1/2 months, successfully holding on to gains after breaching the key
C$1.100 level. Pair now at C$1.1047, not far from the peak of C$1.1059 hit this afternoon, which was the
highest level since April 1. The greenback had pierced C$1.1000 daily since Tuesday, but retraced
below that in the last two days before the end of the trading session. Once the pair broke through that
barrier today, it triggered stop loss buying at several technical levels, says David Bradley, director of
foreign exchange trading at Bank of Nova Scotia. (nirmala.menon@wsj.com, @NirmalaMenon)

15:16 EDT - Venezuela has only 4Q left to enact some form of economic adjustments, Credit Suisse
says, calling it the government's last chance to implement painful measures before entering next year's
election cycle. Bank says it now forecasts a more-severe GDP contraction in 2014 of -2.3% from its
previous estimate of -0.5%. It adds that it still sees the possibility of the country selling $5B more in
bonds this year to feed its dollar-distribution mechanisms. (kejal.vyas@wsj.com)

15:12 EDT - Credit Suisse expects Mexico to grow 2.5%, up slightly from a previous 2.3% estimate, and
in line with consensus expectations in the latest central bank survey. "We feel increasingly confident that
the Mexican economy will continue to benefit from the strength of the U.S. economy," the bank said. For
2015, the bank expects Mexico to grow at a rate of 4.1%. Credit Suisse credits President Enrique Pena
Nieto's reforms, especially Mexico's opening of its energy sector, as a positive "game changer" for the
country's growth outlook. (jose.decordoba@wsj.com; @Jose_deCordoba)
