ABOUT eight international and local groups are vying to buy one of Sydney’s leading residential
conversion development sites, 1 Alfred Street at Circular Quay.
The building, Gold Fields House, is being sold by a consortium led by private equity giant
Blackstone with a price tag of about $400 million. Any development play is expected to yield some
of Sydney’s most luxurious apartments, with previous plans including a $30m penthouse.

Lend Lease and Hong Kong-listed Shimao Property are understood to be bidders. Lend Lease
plans an office tower on the same block and buying the tower would give it a bigger presence in the
precinct. It owns the two old Westpac office buildings on the block and the Jacksons on George pub.
Shimao is controlled by Australia’s richest Chinese-born citizen, billionaireHui Wing Mau.
Another Hong Kong group, private equity real estate firm Joint Treasure, has visited Sydney and
has shown interest in the tower. It has been a big investor for more than two decades and this year
snapped up the Marriott London Grosvenor Square for just over £125m.
China’s Dalian Wanda is also thought to be among the bidders.The parties and the agents on the
Gold Fields deal, CBRE and JLL, declined to comment.
