The tourism sector is the 5th largest contributor to the country's foreign exchange earnings after oil and
gas, palm oil, coal and processed rubber. In 2013, around 8.63 million tourists from various countries
visited the country mainly from Australia, Singapore, Japan and Malaysia with spending of US$9.87
billion in the country. In 2014, the tourism and creative economy ministry set a higher target with 9.2
million visitors and spending of US$10.35 billion. The increase in the number of foreign tourists was
attributable mainly to a number of international events held in the country in 2013 such as APEC summit
meeting and Miss World contest in Bali, etc.

In a bid to increase visits by foreign tourists, the ministry of culture and tourism has launched promotional
campaigns to 10 major tourism markets including Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia and secondary
markets such as Germany and Middle East and sought to open new markets such as in the former Soviet
states and Latin America.

A target has also been set for domestic tourists. The target for the number of visits by domestic tourists in
2014 is set at 255 million with spending or around Rp181 trillion, up 2.82 percent from 248 million visits
with spending at Rp 176.3 trillion in 2013.

The government launched tourism promotion in Indonesia in 2014 with a theme "Wonderful Indonesia
Paradise on Earth." Through the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry (Kemeparekraf), the government
facilitates promotion of tourist destinations by encouraging domestic tourists outside Java and Bali.
Promotion is also intensified of maritime tourism objects such as Wakatobi Sea Park in Southeast
Sulawesi and Raja Ampat beach in Papua.

In 2014, expansion of tourism destinations will focus on 16 Destination Management Organization (DMO),
tourist villages, public recreation centers, tourism markets, creative zones, and cooperation and
partnership. The 11 big cities, which have been the targets of tourism promotion are Medan, Batam,
Pekanbaru, Jakarta, Medan, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Bali, Makassar, and Balikpapan. There are
also promotion program in smaller cities initiated by the regions.

Including in the agenda of national tourism activities for 2014 include Asia Pacific Hash 2014 in Bali and
Labuan Bajo, Flores, National Natural Conservation Promotion, Asena Jazz in Batam, Tour de Bintan, etc.

3.1 million in 2013.
The number of foreign tourists visiting Jakarta has continued to increase reaching 2.1 million in 2013. The

37,000 visits, followed by those from China reaching 21.000 visits, Japan 18,700 visits, Singapore 18,400

around 60,000 tourists and Halim Perdana Kusuma around 6,000 visitors.
In 2014, the number of visits by foreign tourists to Jakarta is expected to rise to more than 2.3 million
from 2.1 million arrivals in 2013. The increase is expected with various events to be held in the city
including annual events of Java Jazz held in March 2014, Jakarta Great Sales 2014, etc.

Tourists from Singapore the largest in number
In 2013, the number of visitors from Singapore rose to 1.68 million. Singapore has become the main
target of tourism marketing by Indonesia over the past several years. In 2012, the number of foreign
visitors from totaled 1.56 million. With the growing number of visitors from Singapore, the number of flight

favorite destinations include Jakarta, Bali, Surabaya, Medan, Padang, Solo, Manado, and Lombok.

In a bid to attract more visitors from Singapore to Indonesia, collateral branding strategy has been
launched with joint promotion of airliner companies to support promotion by Singapore for flights to Bali,

Foreign Exchange Income Target Set at US$ 10.35 Billion For 2014
In 2013, the country's income from the tourism sector was recorded at US$9.87 billion or an increase of
8.2% from US$9.12 billion. In 2014, the government has a set a foreign exchange income target form the
sector at US$10.35 billion.

With that target the government set aside Rp1.7 trillion of the state budget for the promotion and
marketing of the country's tourism. The budget for the tourism sector is relatively small compared with
those of Singapore, Malaysia, dan Thailand. Singapore, a city country, sets aside around US$100 million
for its tourism sector every year.

number of arrivals contributed by 8 main entrance gates including Soekarno-Hatta airport which recorded

203,000, Polonia of Medan 197,000, Batam 1.18 million.

Page115of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Meanwhile, spending by foreign tourists in the country in 2013 averaged US$1,142 per person per visit or
an increase of around 0.7% from an average of US$1,133 in the previous year. Daily spending by a
foreign tourist in 2013 dropped 31.5% to US$100 from US$145.36 in 2012 on the average. Indonesia was
still ahead of Malaysia in spending by foreign tourist per visit. In Malaysia daily spending by a foreign
tourist averaged only US$560 per visit.

However, length of stay in 2013 dropped to 5.5 days per visit on the average from 7.7 days in 2012. The
decline in length of stay was attributable to a decline in the number of visitors from Europe and growing
number of visitors from non European countries. Visitors from Europe normally stay longer and visitors
from other countries especially from neighboring such as Malaysia and Singapore stay for a shorter time.
Meanwhile, the number of domestic travels in 2013 reached 248 million with spending totaling Rp 176.32
trillion or an increase of 1.2% from the previous year's 245 million visits with spending of Rp 171.50
trillion. In 2014, domestic travels are predicted to rise to 255 million with spending totaling Rp181 trillion.

against 3.27 days in Bali, 2.7 days in West Nusatenggara and 2.69 days in East Kalimantan in August
