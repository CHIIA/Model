Chinese investors are snapping up Aust dairy farms and infrastructure, with four multi-million-dollar
mega-deals in progress likely to see Chinese state-owned companies taking big stakes in all Aust’s
largest dairy farming operations. In western Victorian, about 50 dairy farmers have signed individual
option deals to sell their farms, worth a collective $400m, to a -Chinese-dominated dairy conglomerate
being put together by Tasmanian-based property developer Troy Harper. The 50 farms together produce
500m litres of milk a year, about one-twelfth of Victoria’s total milk supply.

The newly aggregated farms will boost their milk production by at least 50%, to supply two new
consortium-owned processing plants to be built in western Victoria. They would process and export
$700m worth of prized infant milk formula into China and other global markets. The new business will
be Aust’s largest dairy farming company, five times bigger than the large Van Diemen’s Land
Company (VDL) in northwest Tasmania, which the state-owned Chinese Investment Corporation came
close to buying last year for more than $200m.
It was also confirmed this week VDL is once again in play. A majority Chinese owned company is set to
buy VDL’s 19,000ha, 25 farms and 18,000 milking dairy cows owned by NZ’s Plymouth District Council.
Also in Tasmania, Landmark Harcourts has assembled 12 dairy farms around the Smithton area
collectively for sale for $120m.
Meanwhile rival Victorian dairy processors with factories in the area such as Saputo-owned
Warrnambool Cheese & Butter factory at Allendale, Murray Goulburn’s dairy processing plant at Koroit
and Fonterra’s Cobden plant, the locking up of 50 farms with their 500m litres of annual milk production
by the Chinese corporation will lead to a drastic shortage of milk supply.
