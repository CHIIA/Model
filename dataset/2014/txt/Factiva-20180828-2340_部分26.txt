SYDNEY—Arrium Ltd. decided two years ago to branch out into the iron-ore market to offset waning
demand for its core product, steel.
Now, with iron-ore prices tumbling, the Australian company says it will seek to reduce debt by issuing
754 million Australian dollars (US$681 million) in new shares.

The shares will be issued at 48 Australian cents each. That is 26% below the stock's closing price of
65 Australian cents a share on Monday. The amount of cash raised will nearly match the company's
market value of A$888 million. The company had A$1.71 billion in net debt on June 30.
"While the company last month reported it had achieved significant progress with debt reduction,
iron-ore prices have fallen significantly in the last month to five-year lows and there is increased
uncertainty over the extent and timing of recovery," Arrium Chairman Peter Smedley said in a written
statement Monday.
Prices for iron ore, which is used to make steel, have fallen as supply rises and China's growth slows.
Spot prices are around US$82 a metric ton, less than half the high of US$190 reached in 2011, but
still more than five times the level of 2004.
Big mining companies such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton continue to increase production because
efficiencies of scale allow them to profit. That makes it harder for smaller operators such as Arrium to
break even.
Mining costs at Arrium's Southern Iron operation in Western Australia are around US$89 a metric ton,
exceeding the current spot price, Credit Suisse estimated this month. Contractual commitments to
customers and costs associated with idling the mine could pressure the company to keep producing.
"I'm surprised they didn't raise capital earlier," said Tim Schroeders, a fund manager at Pengana
Capital, which doesn't hold Arrium stock. "It is probably a forgone opportunity by the board to raise
equity at a much higher A$1.40 to A$1.50 per share."
Arrium shares traded as high as A$1.80 in January, but have been hurt by the sharp slide in iron-ore
prices. The company in 2012 rejected a takeover bid from South Korean steel producer Posco and
commodities trader Noble Group Ltd. pitched at 88 Australian cents a share.
Arrium's decision to raise capital came a week after smaller Australian mining companyWestern
Desert Resources Ltd. appointed voluntary administrators.
Other mining companies are under pressure as well. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. has hired bankers
to sell its mines in Australia because the company has had difficulty competing. Labrador Iron Mines
Holdings Ltd. in Canada this summer halted all operations, saying prices were too low to cover costs.

Australian steelmakers have been further stung by strong a domestic currency, which has made
exports less profitable. This month's drop in the Australian dollar to below 90 U.S. cents for the first
time since March may offer a glimmer of hope.
