"High will be 5294, low will be 5245. Close at 5274, up 28.6 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract pointing up 24 points. The Japanese yen pulled back a little again yesterday
allowing equities more breathing space.

"Given that it is a canary in the coalmine, it will be interesting to know whether the sharp move north from
a few days ago was an initiation move or just some volatility event.

"Overnight in the US, the Semiconductors and Trannies rushed forward, which is bullish. But bellwethers
Goldman Sachs and GE have fallen behind the pace.

"Here in Oz yesterday, index leadership was bullish, paving the way for further gains in the very near term.

"Sector leadership was slightly bullish although the capital goods segment closed lower on the day. The
evidence on the table remains consistent with a run to 5500 by late January to early February.

"In terms of today, the high will be 5294. The low will be 5245. When the dust has settled the market will
have closed at 5274, up 28.6 points".

Trading points:
*RIO: Record prod in iron ore, exceeds cost cutting targets, poss enhanced div?
Rio Tinto CEO Sam Walsh announced record production for iron ore, bauxite and thermal coal in 2013.
The CEO added, "We have exceeded our cost cutting targets for the year and announced or completed
$3.5 billion of non core asset sales. These actions together with lower capital expenditure in 2013 and
beyond will ensure that Rio Tinto is well positioned to deliver greater value to shareholders".

Our thought only: Does this mean a possible higher than expected dividend?! Current dividend forecast for
the year is $US1.90 or thereabouts.
Non core asset divestments totalled $3.5 billion in 2013 of which $2.5 billion was completed in 2013.
Also on January 8 Turquoise Hill announced its $2.4 billion rights offering was fully subscribed. Proceeds
will be used to repay loans outstanding to Rio Tinto, resulting in a $1.2 billion reduction in Rio's
consolidated net debt.
December quarterly iron ore production, shipment and rail volumes was also at a record, with iron ore
production up 6% to 70.4M ton a 100% basis on the previous corresponding period (pcp), with full year
production of 266 Mt, up 5% on the pcp.
Mined copper production was up 5% on the pcp to 172.8Kt (Rio share) and was up 15% for the year to
631.5Kt.

year.
Hard coking coal production was up 25% to 2.4Mt (Rio share) for the quarter vs the pcp and was up 2% to
8.2Mt for the year.
Semi soft and thermal coal production was down 9% vs the pcp to 6.5Mt (Rio share) for the quarter and
was up 12% to 26.8Mt or the year.

Titanium dioxide feedstock was down 20% to 361Kt (Rio share) for the quarter vs the pcp and was up 2%
to 1,622Kt for the year.

production was down 1% on the September quarter, Hard coking coal production was up 7% on the
September quarter, semi soft and thermal coal was down 7% on the September quarter and Titanium
dioxide feedstock was down 3% on the September quarter.
Analysts expectations: A leading broker forecasts Pilbara iron ore production (managed by RIO) of
65.1Mt, up 1% sequentially and up 5.5% year on year. Sales are expected to be ahead of production with
shipments estimated at 69Mt, up 8% quarter on quarter.
Coal an copper production are expected to be flat quarter on quarter.
Bauxite and alumina production are expected to decline 1% and rise 4% respectively.

Aluminium production is expected to decline 2% quarter on quarter.
