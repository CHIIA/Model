MARKET FALLS TO LEVEL LAST SEEN ON FEBRUARY 12

Our market closed down 61.6 points to 5294, a level last seen on February 12, on giant volume worth
$6.9 billion - a significant amount would be related to adjustments on the March SPI close today with the
June SPI becoming the active index. The $A is at 90.06, shedding a little over 1US c since last evening.

All 20 of the Top 20 stocks were weaker.
*Australand rose 6c to $4.04 on 23.3 million shares on speculation that Stockland would make a full bid.
Stockland was steady at $3.75 on 17.5 million shares.

*Myer was down 14c to $2.52 on 9.4m shares after its profit result which came in slightly below
expectations.
*Gold miners fell sharply with Newcrest down 91c to $10.61 on 10.6m shares, Alacer Gold down 35c to
$3.15 on 1.29m shares.

While a low $A vs the US$ boosts the competitiveness of almost all Australian industries from tourism to
manufacture and mining (ironically a weak $A vs the US$ may have prevented the car makers leaving
Australia), if emerging markets weaken sharply on the flow back of funds to the US on expectations of a
higher interest rate, Australia would weaken along with Asia, as we did in the Asian crisis of the late
1990's - with Asian markets also a major outlet for manufactures by both China and Japan.

*The volume indicates likelihood that overseas money was being withdrawn from our market.

*Also, the Japan financial year ends in 10 days time.

*Sharp sell offs are 'stand aside events' except for traders. Investors with medium to long term views may
prefer to wait until the market settles.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 250 points to 14,170 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
up 7.12 points to 2028.85, Hang Seng futures were down 247 points to 21,286 points, S&P futures was
down 3.3 points to 1848.90, Nasdaq futures fell 6.75 points to 3667.5, Dow futures fell 25 points to 16,114
points.
Spot gold is up $5 to $1334. Crude is up 33c to $100.70.
