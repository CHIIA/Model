* Rio Tinto Q1 iron ore shipments down 8 pct vs Q4

* Production up 16 pct on same quarter a year ago

* Keeps guidance for output of 295 million tonnes in 2014 (Adds analyst comment, BHP forecast,
details)

By James Regan
SYDNEY, April 15 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto's iron ore shipments fell 8 percent in the first-quarter from the
previous quarter due to weather-related disruptions in Australia and Canada, but the miner said it was
on track to meet its full-year target.
Production still jumped 16 percent on the same quarter a year ago as the world's No. 2 iron ore
producer behind Brazil's Vale ramps up production at its Australian mines to meet growing demand
from China.

"It appears they were hit a litle harder than we expected by the weather, though we don't see any
issues in meeting their full-year target," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Chris Drew.
Iron ore has replaced other industrial and precious commodities such as coal, gold and silver as the
mineral with the most profit potential, delivering bumper earnings for giant low-cost miners such as
Rio and BHP Billiton.
Iron ore prices <.IO62-CN=SOI> have recovered 12 percent since a steep dip in March on weaker
Chinese steel prices. At the current price of $117 a tonne, Rio Tinto enjoys a profit margin of over $60
a tonne.
Rio Tinto Chief Executive Sam Walsh has repeatedly deflected criticism the company is too
dependent on iron ore - accounting for almost half of the company's 2013 revenue - saying China
will continue to buy all the ore it can mine for years to come.
Walsh was promoted to chief executive in 2013 to whip the company into shape following disastrous
investments in aluminium and coal that led to $14 billion in write-offs.

WEATHER BITES
Rio Tinto said its Iron Ore of Canada division was hit by a colder-than-average winter, which
disrupted mining in Labrador over the quarter, while port closures due a cyclone late last year
reduced shipments in Australia, the company said.
Overall iron ore shipments in the first quarter came in at 66.7 million tonnes.
Rio said it was on track to meet its target of mining ore at the rate of 290 million tonnes a year and
maintained its 2014 production target of 295 million tonnes.
It planned to draw on its Australian stocks of iron ore to increase shipments ahead of production, with
around 5 million tonnes of inventory drawdown expected in 2014.

percent by Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Co.
Rio Tinto put its stake in IOC up for sale about a year ago but offers came in well below the mining
group's target of about $3.5 to $4 billion, sources said.
Production of 295 million tonnes in 2014 would keep Rio Tinto ahead of rivals BHP Billiton and
Fortescue Metals Group, which report quarterly data on Wednesday.

BHP is also expected to show lower shipments in the March quarter after Cyclone Christie barreled
into Australia's Pilbara iron ore belt in late 2013 disrupting rail and port shipping operations into
January.
UBS forecasts BHP's Australian operations, including shares to joint venture partners will see a
modest drop in first quarter production to 53 million tonnes against 53.6 million in the fourth quarter.
