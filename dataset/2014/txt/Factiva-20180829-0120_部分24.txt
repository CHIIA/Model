Futures closing at 5344, down 14 points on 1811 contracts while the June SPI Futures, now the active
index, down 54 points to 5308 on 13,436 contracts. The volume on the physical market is related to the
SPI Futures change over. Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 2 points. The $A is at 90.06US c, down
about 40 points from early levels.

*The banks have contributed 11.7 negative points to the index, resources have contributed 9.3 negative
points, property trusts have contributed 0.2 positive points, retailers have contributed 3.9 negative points
and Telstra has contributed 1.2 negative points.

*The Nikkei Dow futures is down 130 points to 14,290 points, Shanghai CSI physical is down 6.94 points
to 2014.79, Hang Seng futures is down 240 points to 21,293 points. S&P futures is down 3.3 points to
1848.90, Nasdaq futures is down 7.25 points to 3667 points. Dow futures is down 25 points to 16,114

Spot gold is up $2 to $1331. Crude is up 10c to $100.47.

*Winners are hard to find with the market contemplating the coming outflow of capital from emerging
markets back to the US if it follows through with rate hikes next year and the impact on the local market.
Meanwhile, China's slowdown is another concern. Gold is up $ at midday, also India has slightly loosened
the import of gold (below in other news).

"I will call the market down 30 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The Dow had a volatile night, trading in a large range,
with a low of 16,126, rallying at the close to about 100 points off its lows.

"The S&P 500 had about a 25 point range last night. The 1850 level of support was tested last night - it
was always going to be good support.

"Even though it had a down night the S&P 500 still closed above the 20 day moving average which is
sitting at 1858. It is at a pivotal point here. Any break and close below the 20 day moving average would
be pretty bearish again, given that it has not tested the new highs for a week. If 1858 breaks on the week
it is probably going to enter another short term downtrend.
"Gold got hammered for the third night. Interestingly, gold is sitting right on the very bottom of the uptrend
line that began in December/January. Any break and close below 1329 for the week could be pretty
bearish.
"Support is now at $1295 on gold.
"Interestingly copper had a small upside move, up about 3/4c and is now looking as if it may test th
e$3/lob level, a key level of resistance.

Page106of315©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The $A is in no man's land at the moment. It probably has downward pressure if the bond markets in the
US continue to get sold off.

"The XJO had no real technical moves yesterday although it was good it closed above 5350. It is
obviously going to fall below that today. Support is now at 5330 and below that on 5315.

"A break of 5315 today or tomorrow will see us enter into a downtrend which will be pretty bearish given
we have had an inverse head and shoulders last week and given we have not been able to break back
above the 20 day moving average as the S&P500 has done. Our XJO chart is a lot more bearish than the
S&P's.

"The 5330 and 5315 chart levels are critical.

"I will call the market down 30 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 11 points to 5355.6 last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY
Reserve bank of India permits 3 more banks to import gold
Reuters India reports India has allowed five domestic private sector banks to import gold.
India's central bank has allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank , Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd
Bank and Yes Bank, officials at the respective banks told Reuters.
India enforced the so-called 80/20 rule in July, making it mandatory to export a fifth of all gold imports.
Under that rule, only six banks and three state-run trading agencies that had facilitated export of gold or
jewellery in the past three years were allowed to import. The six banks were mostly state-run lenders.
The Reserve Bank of India - the central bank - has now permitted gold imports within prescribed limits by
the private banks even though they had not facilitated any exports of metal or jewellery in the past three
years.

routes.

AIA general manager Glenn Wedlock said in the report the cost of the announcement to the New Zealand
tourism industry is over $NZ70 million per year. Auckland Airport is actively working to replace the value.

Transport, that the proposed alliance between Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand could have
detrimental impact on the growth and promotion of competition in international air services.

December but with significant improvement immediately prior to Christmas and a very strong Stocktake
Sale.

Operating gross profit margin fell 21 basis points to 41% from 41.21% for the pcp. While there were
positive impacts from the growth of Myer Exclusive Brands, there were three key reasons fort he decline in
margin. The first was the strength of the Stocktake sale and the second was the impact of the change in
the overall mix due to the increase in concession sales. The third was a strong response to loyalty
initiatives such as MYER one bonus point promotions and bounce back offers used extensively during the
Stocktake Sale.

Given continued pressure on discretionary income and uncertain consumer sentiment, the CEO said the
company remains cautious about the trading environment for the remainder of the year.

in May 2014 and the Indooroopilly store refurbishment expected to finish in June 2014. Also the
Melbourne City store is expected to benefit from the opening of 7,000 sq m of new space within the
Emporium development adjoining the store from May 2014.

new stores at Joondalup in WA and Mount Gravatt in Qld in the first quarter of 2015, completion of major
refurbishment, growth in Myer Exclusive Brands and the online business.

Cost growth headwinds are also expected to moderate.

Analysts expectations: $68.6 mln, div 9.5c.

Analyst after Myer's interim report: Expects consensus EBIT downgrades

A leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Myer, saying the result was strong with profits 5/6% ahead
of its expectations with like for like sales growth higher, gross margins lower but cost growth of just 2.2%
was far lower than the broker's forecast.

"MYR had guided to 4/5% cost growth for the 2014 full year which includes a higher skew of one off costs
in the first half, hence the lower cost growth is a surprise".

The broker added gross margins were weaker than expected.
It expects consensus downgrades with Myer's current EBIT of around $174 million below consensus
EBIT of $A194 million with the broker at EBIT of $A192 million.
