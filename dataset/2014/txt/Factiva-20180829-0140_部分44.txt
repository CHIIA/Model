Current Environment

Sector Overview

Economic growth throughout the Asia-Pacific over the past six months led to a rise in the consumption of
oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to fuel booming vehicle use and industrial growth, especially in China.
Energy demand continued to rise significantly across developing Asia, driven by shifting economic,
environmental and geopolitical factors, coinciding with a very tight global oil supply. The global growth of
new oil supply hardly exceeded declining production from the world's large older oil fields, causing a very
slight overall net supply increase.
Oil prices peaked at US$116.75 on September 9, 2013 before bottoming at US$103.08 a barrel on
November 7 and then fluctuating upwards. Oil prices were relatively high in the third quarter of 2013
before hitting a low in the fourth quarter. This had significant economic implications as oil provides 60% of
the world's energy needs, with the other 40% coming from coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, solar, tidal
power and biomass.
Asia-Pacific oil consumption growth was the second highest globally, 47%, after the Middle East's 57%,
while consumption in the European Union (EU) fell by 5% and in the US by 3%. The decline in EU and US
consumption was due to the shift from oil to gas and renewable energy.

Natural gas consumption continued to rise strongly over the past six months, as it did in the past decade,
to fuel booming industrial needs and power generation. Asia accounted for 70% of the world's LNG
market, and the strong demand combined with oil-linked LNG pricing, drove Asia-Pacific prices higher.

Page125of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The demand was intensified by a sudden rise in demand from Japan to meet its electricity needs following
the shutdown of its nuclear generators.

Natural gas continued to be the key to Asia-Pacific economic growth and environmental progress, with
energy demand estimated to grow by 59% over the next three decades, after steady increases over the
past decade. Natural gas can meet more of the demand for electricity, chemicals and plastics, improving
quality of life and reducing environmental impact at the same time. Natural gas will slowly continue to
replace coal as the region's second biggest energy source, with the upstream oil and gas market offering
new business opportunities for the growing number of independent and expanding state oil companies.

Sector Performance
Global oil demand rose slowly in the second half of 2013, because of slow economic recovery and tight
oil supply due to sanctions on Iran.

Leading Companies
All major oil companies in the region continued to climb back from recession, and benefited from a
recovering global economy that spurred rises in crude prices, although the regional production and
domestic refining margins of many leading companies declined.
China National Offshore Oil Co Ltd (CNOOC) (HKSE: 883)
China's biggest offshore oil producer CNOOC reported revenue of RMB170,764 million (US$28,056.525
million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of 17.4% from a year earlier. Its
realized oil price was down by 6.8% to US$104.88 per barrel and realized gas price down by 4.9% to
US$5.59 per 1,000 cubic feet. Its capital expenditure rose 54.1% to RMB60,675 million (US$9,968.903
million). Production levels were up by 17.8% from a year earlier to 103.4 million barrels of oil equivalent

Page126of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.(boe). The company made a discovery in Luda 5-2N at Suizhong 36-1 oilfield, Bohai, and successfully
appraised Kenli 9-5/9-6 at Laizhou Bay Sag in Bohai.
Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOC) (BSE: 530965)
State-owned IOC reported a net profit of Rs1,684 crore (US$274.492 million) for the quarter ended
September 30, 2013, a drop of 82.5% from a year earlier. This was due to exchange losses of Rs2,158
crore (US$351.754 million) in the quarter, against an exchange gain of Rs2,289 crore (US$373.107
million) a year earlier. Revenue rose by 4% from a year earlier to Rs110,390.24 crore (US$17,993.609
million) and earnings per equity share were down by 82.55% to Rs6.94 (US$0.11). The company has
increased its presence in the upstream sector and enhanced its capability in exploration and production
(E&P).

It has participating interests in 13 domestic and nine overseas blocks and has made discoveries in some
of them, while many others are undergoing geological and geophysical studies. IOC had an excellent
operational performance in the just concluded fiscal year, surpassing all previous records. Its pipeline
achieved its highest ever throughput of 75.55 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products, an
increase of 10.3% from the previous year.

Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) (KLSE: PETD)
Revenue rose 8.5% from a year earlier to RM232,507 million (US$71,193.643 million), while cash flows
from operating activities decreased by 5.3% to RM61,476 million (US$18,823.951 million). Total
production rose by 5.7% from 1,985 thousand boe per day to 2,098 thousand boe per day. Crude oil and
condensates production rose by 43 thousand boe per day due to production resumption in South Sudan,
production enhancement efforts and new production from Malaysia and Iraq. Natural gas production rose
by 105 thousand boe per day from a year earlier because of additional production from Canada and newly
producing fields in Malaysia.

Mergers and Acquisitions
The rate of Asia-Pacific oil and gas mergers and acquisitions (M&A) picked up slowly over the six months
under review, amid a slowdown in the global economy and sanctions on Iranian oil. The motivation for
deals varied in different countries and companies. China and India's national oil companies (NOCs)
continued their quest to acquire as much technology and knowledge as possible from their western
partners to exploit their own huge unconventional assets, while Malaysia and South Korea focused on
diversifying their reserves and production bases to boost national energy self-sufficiency.

High growth in emerging markets, over-capacity in developed regions and the need to develop new and
efficient technology solutions for company development also drove M&As. Japan actively acquired
overseas gas assets to replace lost nuclear power capacity after the Fukushima nuclear plant crisis, and
to secure supplies of LNG before long-term contracts expire.

Regional companies also focused on portfolio management and concentrated on core business, given
high oil prices and gradual economic recovery, and made M&As to gain market share. In January 2014,
the Indonesian Government approved a proposal from state oil and gas company PT Pertamina to
acquire state-run PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN), a publicly listed gas distributor and transmitter, and
the acquisition process will take eight months. Pertamina would merge PGN with its gas subsidiary, PT
Pertagas that holds several gas concessions.

Pertamina would have 30% to 38% of PGN, the Government between 36% and 40%, down from its
current 57%, and the public share would decline to between 26% and 30% from 43%. Pertamina's holding
in PGN would increase to between 70% and 74% if the Government decided to be represented by
Pertamina in PGN. Pertamina assessed that the acquisition would generate additional profits of between
US$2 and US$3 billion from operational efficiency, dividends and taxes.
While M&As might not offer much immediate return, they should boost reserves and production of NOCs
in the long term and help companies diversify from declining domestic reserves. They are important for
energy security and supplement domestic crude oil and natural gas production.

Industry Profile

Industry Size and Value
The Asia-Pacific has less than 4% of the world's proven oil reserves, and the industry has few options to
expand or maintain its current levels of production. The region has large coal reserves, the primary
energy source in China and India, while the rest of the region relies on crude oil. The developing

Page127of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.countries will consume 94% of the oil consumed by industrialized countries by 2025, and oil is likely to
remain the world's foremost source of primary energy over the next two decades.

Australia remains a significant player in the global LNG market, due to the development of its offshore gas
resources and onshore unconventional gas reserves. Australia, ranked 11th in global natural gas reserves
and fourth in LNG exports, has the potential to become the leading LNG exporting country, overtaking
Qatar. Currently, Australian LNG is expensive, costing 20% more to deliver to Japan than LNG from
Canada and the US. Floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) will be the solution to reduce the cost and
unlock stranded gas. FLNG is a water-based LNG operation that enables the development of offshore
natural gas resources by floating above an offshore natural gas field. FLNG facilities can produce, liquefy,
store and transfer LNG at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets.

Australia will be among the first countries to use FLNG technology, with several projects under
development, such as Royal Dutch Shell's (LSE: RDSA) Prelude project, off Western Australia, and GDF
Suez's Bonaparte FLNG project, off Northern Australia. FLNG requires revolutionary technology to solve
technical and execution challenges. It offers environmental benefits over conventional offshore LNG that
involves transport pipelines to shore, which could be several hundred kilometers away, and to an onshore
processing facility, all of which involve construction materials and seabed and land disturbance. FLNG
also reduces the impact on sensitive coastal habitats as it excludes the need for shoreline pipe crossing,
dredging and jetty works.

FLNG facilities allow economic access to large reserves from offshore fields previously considered
stranded gas, and are cheaper per tonne to build with a lighter environmental footprint than conventional
LNG and other fossil fuel energy sources. The technology is not limited to offshore Western Australia or
the previously considered stranded gas, but can also be used in regions where security issues prevent
onshore processing.
Oil and Gas Production and Consumption
The level of overall oil and gas production and consumption in the region increased slightly over the past
six months despite a weak global economy. Asia-Pacific crude oil proved reserves grew by 12.4% from a
year earlier to 47.224 billion barrels in 2013. Production rose by 0.6% to 8,996.5 thousand bbl/d (bbl/d) in
2012, and consumption by 3.4% to 29,566.7 thousand barrels per day. China continued to have the
largest global oil consumption growth, 5.5%, and 21.5% growth in natural gas consumption, compared
with Japan's 11.6%.
ONGC discovered three significant new oil and gas reserves in India through the prolific KG-DWN-2005/1
and KG-DWN-98/2, both at Krishna-Godavari basin blocks in Andhra Pradesh and GK-28 in Kutch
shallow offshore in the Western offshore basin. The company has yet to ascertain the commercial
potential of the three discoveries and reserves estimates. The discovery was a significant boost to the
company's efforts in attaining critical hydrocarbon volumes for the viability of a possible cluster-based
development for the block.

The Asia-Pacific's proved natural gas reserves fell by 0.1% from a year earlier to 504.408 trillion cubic feet
(Tcf) in 2013, as the region tried to replace oil and coal with natural gas to reduce carbon footprints and
greenhouse effects. Production levels were up 1% from a year earlier to 18,601 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in
2011, consumption by 6.8% to 22,001 Bcf, imports by 19.1% to 9,077 Bcf and exports by 1% to 4,241 Bcf.
China's gas production grew rapidly with new pipelines and exploration of gas potential basins, especially
in the western interior and offshore. It has the world's longest gas pipeline that began operating in the
fourth quarter of 2012.

Australia's gas industry is also growing rapidly, with its deep waters providing long-term gas production
growth. Fields throughout the North West Shelf are being developed to supply a growing domestic market
and to expand LNG export capacity. New large deepwater discoveries in eastern India are also being
developed, leading to higher gas output to replace that from Mumbai where production has peaked.

Industry Focus
Strengthening Energy Security
Asia is the second largest gas-consuming region, and demand is rising quickly. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) estimates that the LNG market will expand by a third from 2011 to 2017. The demand for oil
is also growing, and the region is exposed to potential petroleum supply disruption in the Middle East,
where Iran currently threatens to block access for oil tankers to the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20%
of the world's oil passes.
A major disruption in the strait could increase oil prices to US$160 per barrel and trigger a severe crisis in
Japan. Without nuclear power to diversify its energy mix, Japan's federal deficit could reach Y12 trillion

Page128of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.(US$116.4 billion), an associate for energy security and sustainability at Japan's Institute of Energy
Economics estimates. Nuclear plants generated 30% of Japan's electricity before the Fukushima disaster,
and the country has subsequently raised its imports of natural gas and introduced policies to boost
renewable energy development. Without nuclear power, Japan is finding it hard to meet energy security
goals.
Indonesia, a prominent regional producer of oil and gas, will need at least two more oil refineries to meet
50% of its fuel oil needs until 2020. Even with the construction of refineries with a capacity of 300 million
bbl/d, the country will continue to be a net oil importer until 2025. Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned
oil and natural gas corporation, believes that demand for oil will continue to grow parallel with
consumption in the transportation and industrial sectors, from 454.75 million barrels a year in 2013 to
850.38 million barrels in 2025.
China has urged Asian and European countries to boost their cooperation on energy security, disaster
prevention and alleviation. It has also urged energy producers and consumers in Asia and Europe to work
together to create a new principle of mutually beneficial cooperation, diversified forms of development and
common energy security through coordination. Both regions need to develop clean and renewable
energy, improve energy structure, stabilize prices, safeguard market stability, improve efficiency, and
build energy-saving modes of production and consumption. Asian countries have acquired wide
experience in disaster prevention, while European countries have developed the latest technology.
To boost energy security, China is urging the two regions to coordinate their policies, build a cooperative
mechanism for emergency rescue in major disasters and provide mutual humanitarian assistance. China
also recommends establishing an efficient information exchange channel to improve disaster monitoring
and early warning and strengthen cooperation on the application of space technology in disaster
prevention and alleviation. China has also suggested that countries share experience and improve their
disaster prevention and alleviation ability through personnel exchange and training.
For Asia to reduce gas prices and improve energy security the region needs better physical connections
between its various energy and electricity supplies. This was done by Europe to achieve relative energy
security, and Asia could create such a super-grid by incorporating existing and new pipelines within Asia
and those from Russia.

Policy and Regulatory Environment
Policies and regulations for all Asia-Pacific oil and gas industries are revised when the need arises to
make them relevant and coherent with current markets and economic environments. Among the recent
measures have been Australian Government tax changes in its federal budget in May 2013, which will
directly increase costs associated with developing oil and gas resources, as they increase the costs
associated with trading and buying into exploration permits.

This will result in a more costly turnover of companies' interest in exploration permits, a crucial step in
enabling the commercial alignment that allows projects to proceed on a timely basis. The changes will
have a particular impact on small or medium exploration companies that wish to sell an interest to larger,
better-resourced or more experienced companies on a full or partial cash basis. The changes to the
deductibility rules will mean that a purchasing company cannot obtain a timely deduction for the
acquisition cost, resulting in less incentive for the purchase, and the proposed write-off period of 15
years will not reflect commercial reality.

The Indian Budget 2013 steeply raised the tax rate on royalties and fees for technical services that an
Indian company pays to a non-resident Indian (NRI) or a foreign company. The rate rose from 10% to
25%, as the rate of tax on royalty in the Income-tax Act was lower than the rates provided in a number of
double tax avoidance agreements (DTAA).

For an NRI residing in a country with which India has a DTTA, the new tax rate will not be applicable, but it
will apply to India-US DTAA. Those who wish to claim the reduced rate of tax deduction at source (TDS)
or a waiver of TDS under the DTAA must submit a tax residency certification from the country of residence
to certify that the payer is a tax paying resident in the other country and that tax on that income is being
paid in that country. This is to prevent leakage of tax revenue for either country.

Market Trends and Outlook
Growing Asian nations, especially China and India have led the world's oil demand over the past few
years.Asian equity capital continued to flow into private North American oil and gas companies as it has
over the past four years.Asian companies are turning to unconventional gas to cut their reliance on
imported energy, mitigate environmental damage and improve energy security.

The Asia-Pacific is likely to become the world's second largest gas market by 2015, but the market is
dominated by long-term contracts, in which the price of gas is linked to that of oil, that have helped keep
Asian gas prices much higher than those elsewhere.

Market Trends & Outlook
Asia-Pacific Continues to Lead Oil Demand Growth
The growing Asian nations, especially China and India, have led the world's oil demand over the past few
years. The IEA expects Indian oil demand to rise by 3.9% annually and Chinese demand by 3.5%
annually until 2030. Chinese oil demand is expected to more than double to 16.3 million bbl/d by 2030,
from 7.7 million bbl/d in 2008, while Indian demand could jump from three million bbl/d in 2008 to 6.9
million bbl/d in 2030. This compares with just 1% year-on-year global growth, since most Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies are expected to have declining oil demand
due to energy efficiency. India is likely to overtake Japan as the third largest oil and natural gas
consumer by 2020, while China will overtake the US as the world's largest consumer by 2025.

The ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, many of which have seen rapid
economic growth over the past three decades, will also see strong growth in energy demand. IEA
estimates that total ASEAN demand is likely to increase from 3.5 million bbl/d in 2008 to 5.3 million bbl/d
by 2030, because of rapid gross domestic product (GDP) growth and current levels of low energy
consumption per person. ASEAN GDP is expected to rise by 4% annually from 2007 to 2015, and then by
3.7% a year from 2015 to 2030. Non-OECD Asia will see average annual oil demand growth of 1.8% until
2030.

Asian Investors Turn to North America
Over the past six months, Asian equity capital continued to flow into private North American oil and gas
companies as it has over the past four years, with companies such as Sinopec, Itochu Corp (TES: 8001),
Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC), CNOOC, Mitsui & Co (TSE: 8031), Marubeni Corp (TSE: 8002) and RIL
very active. Investment targets ranged from Western Canada's oil sands and LNG complex to West
Texas unconventional shale assets and the Gulf of Mexico through participation in buyout consortia that
provide joint venture capital and preferred equity investment in corporations.

Through various asset bases, structures, returns and counterparties, investments are aimed at learning
leading edge onshore drilling techniques, establishing incumbency in attractive asset bases and achieving
strong returns.
Asian public institutional equity investors are following their private investment counterparts in looking at
North American oil and gas opportunities for attractive growth and returns. Asian institutions are
underweight in North American oil and gas, with investment totaling US$7.3 billion, 85% of it coming from
Japan. North American public equity holdings in upstream companies indicate that there are opportunities
to speed up investment in the sector.
Asian investors currently hold more than US$109 billion in oil and gas assets under management, and
their market depth is enough to attract potential shareholders. Japan is the second largest single-country
capital market in the world, with capital totaling US$22 trillion, and US$700 billion invested in foreign

Page130of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.equities, 44% of it in North America. Realizing the great potential of Asian investors, North American
companies have conducted non-deal road shows in Asia to educate institutional investors, with prioritized
stops in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul and Singapore.

Australian institutional investors are also beginning to look to companies in North America, where the LNG
industry is increasingly a supplier of choice to Asian markets. Globalization within the North America
industry has speeded up and companies are forming operational and financial partnerships with Asian
counterparts.

Asian Development of Unconventional Gas Increases
Asian economies are turning to unconventional gas to cut their reliance on imported energy, mitigate
environmental damage and improve energy security. China, India and Thailand already consume more
gas than they produce, and that gap will widen unless they can boost their production of unconventional
resources such as tight gas, shale gas and coal bed methane. Energy ministers from Asia- Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries recognize the need to explore ways to secure supplies other
than from conventional gas.

The growth in shale gas in the US is having ripple effects on gas pricing throughout the world, including
Asia. Japanese companies are looking at Henry Hub pricing for natural gas, due to the correlation
between that benchmark and the price Japan must pay to secure gas on the spot market. The prospects
for continuing or have more rapid growth in production, both in the US and elsewhere, are pressuring mid
and long-term price assumptions. The US Department of Energy's latest long-term forecast expects shale
gas production to reach more than 12 Bcf per day by 2020, and 17 Bcf per day by 2035. Asian companies
are forming alliances with western firms who are familiar with the technology used in the US shale gas
sector and are trying to secure a stand in that market themselves.
China is set to exploit more unconventional gas reserves to meet rising demand and to power its rapid
economic growth as it grapples with energy shortages and climate change. The National Energy
Administration (NEA) reported that China has huge unconventional gas resources, and that increasing
unconventional gas production could ease oil demand, dodge rising costs of oil production and cut
carbon emissions. China's coal-based energy consumption mode is changing as the country seeks to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40% to 45% from 2005 levels by 2020.
The Government is encouraging the use of more natural gas to meet its burgeoning domestic energy
needs, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by using cleaner-burning gas and renewable energy
resources. Exploration and production companies are learning from foreign companies experienced in
shale gas drilling how to explore for and develop China's untapped shale gas resources. The
development of shale gas has raised environmental concerns, including the possible pollution of
groundwater supplies. However, most industry experts are confident that unconventional gas might soon
become an additional alternative source of energy.

Market Outlook

Asia-Pacific estimates its economic growth in 2013 at 7.3%, despite the global economic downturn and
uncertainty surrounding Eurozone sovereign debt. A significant restriction on economic growth is the
region's huge dependence on foreign oil and gas imports. To reduce dependency and boost energy
security, countries are seeking to satisfy as much demand as possible from domestic sources, especially
in China, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. Thus, Asia is becoming an increasingly important
region for oil and gas exploration and drilling. As the sector is dominated by offshore production, its
offshore capex is likely to grow significantly over the next five years.

Asia-Pacific is likely to become the world's second largest gas market by 2015, but the market is
dominated by long-term contracts, in which the price of gas is linked to that of oil, that have helped keep
Asian gas prices much higher than those elsewhere.
Asia's rapid growth depends on the availability of LNG supplies to meet rising future energy needs, mainly
for new, cleaner electricity generation. Its rush for resources risks pushing oil and LNG prices higher and
strengthens producers in using energy for political and diplomatic advantage. The region's quest for more
secure oil and LNG supplies has driven it toward greater dependence on and engagement in key oil and
gas exporting regions, especially the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. The uncertain political situation
and unrest in the Middle East have concentrated the risks of supply disruption on the Asian oil market,
which is the primary destination of Middle East oil, while disruptions in the Persian Gulf would expose all
importers to price rather than physical risks.

Japan, once considered a mature and saturated market, has now become a resurgent market and will
remain the world's largest LNG importer for the next few years. Japan's rising LNG needs have begun to
intensify concerns among other Asian LNG buyers over energy security. These concerns will likely

Page131of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.continue for the next five years, until more supplies become available from major new projects. By 2020,
North American shale gas supplies could play a key role in meeting Asia's needs for supply diversification.

Country Profiles

Australia

Sector Overview
Over the past six months, Australia's oil production fell as consumption rose, in a continuing long-term
inverse trend that has remained ongoing over several years. The oil and gas industry contributes 58% of
Australia's primary energy and A$28 billion (US$25.24 billion) a year to the economy, with access to
energy resources essential to continuing economic growth. The industry is responsible for more than
A$0.30 (US$0.27) in every dollar of Australian private sector investment. While Australia has found gas
faster than it has produced it, as it has done for a quarter of a century, it only has a decade of known oil
resources remaining at current production rates.

The development of Australia's gas resources continued due to the rise in demand from Asia and the
ability to sell LNG to Asia at oil-linked prices. Nevertheless, Australia is the world's most expensive place
for offshore petroleum E&P, three times more expensive than the US Gulf Coast and a little costlier than
Norway. Despite that, it has benefited from a US$180 billion LNG investment boom with seven major
projects under construction.

These projects are 80% more capital intensive than those in operation, mainly due to labor costs being
double those of many of its competitors, even though productivity is lower. The industry is in danger of
missing out on another US$150 billion investment in new LNG projects due to high costs, although the
investment is needed for new projects to meet Asian and domestic demand. The LNG industry is likely to
dry up by 2017 if there are no additional projects.

The resources boom has provided successive Australian Governments with extra tax revenues for the
past decade. The May 2013 tax changes in the federal budget, which affect exploration costs, and new
capitalization rules, will negatively influence the industry's international competitiveness. They continue
the trend of fiscal and regulatory changes that have reduced investor confidence. The industry is currently
investing around A$200 billion (US$180.26 billion) over five years on new projects that will pay billions
every year to the Government and create more than 100,000 new jobs.
Oil Sector
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates Australia's crude oil proved reserves at 1.433
billion barrels in 2013, up by 0.5% from 2012. Production levels fell by 2.1% from 2011 to 519.1 thousand
bbl/d in 2012, while consumption picked up by 1.9% to 1,126.1 thousand bbl/d.
Brisbane-based Linc Energy discovered a 233 billion barrel shale oil source in the Arckaringa Basin in
South Australia's far north with an estimated value of A$20 trillion (US$18.026 trillion). South Australia's
Mining Minister said that it is still early to say if the reserve can be tapped profitably.

Natural Gas Sector

The EIA estimates Australia's 2013 natural gas reserves at 43.037 Tcf, up by 54.5% from 2012. The
country produced 1.02 Tcf in 2012, down by 17.7% from a year earlier, and consumed 1.02 Tcf, a
decrease of 17.7%. Imports in 2012 rose by 67.8% from 2011 to 386 Bcf, and exports by 11.6% to 1,069
Bcf.

Gas production is growing, but generates less than 9% of the country's electricity, low by international
standards. Gas is an under-used resource with potential for further expansion as it is the cleanest
practical source of large-scale base load and peaking power for Australia, is cheaper than solar and wind
power, and does not depend on weather conditions or the time of day.

Leading Companies

Santos (ASX: STO)
In third quarter 2013, Santos produced 13.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), down by 1% from a
year earlier, and by 8% from the previous quarter. Sales volumes fell by 7% to 15.5 mmboe from a year
earlier, but rose by 8% from the previous quarter. Sales revenue rose by 20% to US$1,027 million, driven
by the highest production in six years, strong oil prices and higher third party sales volume. Gas
production of 9.5 mmboe was 5% lower than a year earlier, with higher Darwin LNG production offset by
lower production in Bangladesh and the Otway Basin.

Page132of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Woodside Petroleum (ASX: WPL)

Woodside Petroleum's production decreased to 21.9 mmboe in third quarter 2013, down by 17.4% from
the corresponding period in 2012, but up by 9.5% from the previous quarter. Sales volumes also
decreased, by 15.7% from a year earlier to 20.9 mmboe, but rose by 3.5% from the previous quarter. The
decrease in production and sales volumes was due to the Vincent FPSO, offshore Western Australia
being off station for planned shipyard maintenance, lower LNG sales from Pluto, Carnarvon Basin,
Western Australia due to unplanned outage at the beginning of the quarter, and lower condensate sales
from the North West Shelf due to the timing of shipments. Sales revenue decreased by 26.8% to
US$1,338 million from a year earlier but declined by 0.5% from the second quarter. The larger gas
volumes sold resulted in lower average realized prices, while the average Brent price for the quarter was
US$109.65 per barrel, slightly above the US$109.42 per barrel a year earlier.

Market Outlook
New plants are likely to boost Australia's LNG capacity from 24 million metric tonnes a year to more than
80 million metric tonnes by 2017, with most of the additional output designated for Asian markets. Many
sedimentary basins have seen little exploration, while many regions with hydrocarbons have not been
drilled to any significant extent.

Australia could soon overtake Indonesia as Asia-Pacific's biggest importer of refined products when old
and high cost refineries such as Clyde and Kurnell on the outskirts of Sydney close and with demand
continuing to rise strongly. The increasing reliance on oil imports is likely to benefit independent trading
houses.
China

Sector Overview
Over the past six months, China's economic growth has slowed and oil and petrochemical demand has
been weak, although demand for oil products continued to grow. The Government further improved the
pricing mechanism for oil products, adjusted natural gas prices and announced a premium pricing policy
for upgraded quality oil products.
China is the world's largest energy consumer and the second largest oil consumer behind the US. Its
economic development and prosperity depends on its access to natural resources of which it has few of
its own. China's 12th Five-Year-Plan sets aggressive targets for shale gas production of 0.6 Bcf per day
by 2015, with plans to scale-up production to between 5.8 and 9.6 Bcf per day by 2020. Between 1,200
and 1,500 wells need to be drilled to meet the target, but only 60 exploration wells have been drilled so
far.
China continued to focus on developing largely unexploited reserves in the western interior provinces and
offshore fields, since its large oil fields have matured, and production has peaked. It had speeded up its
exploration for oil and gas in deepwater areas in the South China Sea, which contains up to 30 billion
tonnes of oil and 16 trillion cubic meters of gas.
China continued to build pipelines to ship 440,000 barrels of crude and 12 billion cubic meters of natural
gas a day from the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar to Kunming, Yunan Province. The oil pipeline will be
800km long and the natural gas pipeline will extend further to meet the needs of cities such as Kunming,
Guizhou and Guangxi in southwestern China. This project is part of the country's efforts to improve
energy security as its economy continues to expand.
Oil Sector
EIA reported that China's crude oil proved reserves in 2013 rose by 25.7% from 2012 to 25.585 billion
barrels. Production in 2012 rose by 1.6% from 2011 to 4,416.2 thousand bbl/d, and consumption by 4.3%
to 10,276.8 thousand bbl/d.
In November 2013, China took control of Ecuador's oil sector after securing the rights to up to 90% of
Ecuador's oil shipments for the next few years, in exchange for covering 61% of the country's US$6.2
billion financing needs in 2013. Little of the oil will be shipped to China, but Chinese oil firms can sell the
oil to Ecuador's trading partners and receive enormous discounts, and the US is the largest recipient of
Ecuadorean oil.

Natural Gas Sector

Page133of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.China had proved natural gas reserves of 124.2 Tcf in 2013, an increase of 16.1% from 2012, EIA
reported, and production levels rose by 11.4% from 2011 to 5,152 Bcf in 2012. Domestic production could
not match consumption, causing a big rise in imports.
A China-Myanmar gas pipeline became fully operational on October 20, 2013, and will fuel China's
southwest regions with piped natural gas for the first time and decrease gas prices in those areas. Some
793 km of the 2,520 km trunk line are in Myanmar, running through south west China's Yunan, Guizhou
and Chongqing Provinces, and south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The pipeline starts
from Kyaukpyu Harbor, Myanmar and ends in Guijang, Guizhou province, and its builder, China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), said that it would transport 12 billion cubic meters of gas each year to
Myanmar and the Chinese regions. This will improve local air quality as 90% of local factories in Guizhou
currently rely on coal and most residents' cooking fuel is refined from coal.

Leading Companies
China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) (HKSE: 386)

Sinopec, Asia's biggest refiner, reported a 21.56% increase in third quarter profit from a year earlier to
RMB22.183 billion (US$3.64 billion). Its operating income rose by 7.09% to RMB724.68 billion
(US$119.06 billion), with basic earnings per share up by 17.9% to RMB0.191 (US$0.031) and diluted
earnings per share rising by 16.45% to RMB0.177 (US$0.029). The company optimized exploration areas
and made major breakthroughs in new blocks such as the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Province. It intensified
its progressive exploration and oil reserve evaluation in projects such as West Junggar in Xinjiang, Tahe
in Heilongjiang and East Shengli in Shangdong, while continuing to develop the Daniudi Gas field in
northwestern China.

PetroChina (HKSE: 857)
PetroChina, the nation's largest oil and gas producer, earned a net profit of RMB29.77 billion (US$4.88
billion) in third quarter 2013, up by 19.4% from a year earlier, basic earnings per share totaled RMB0.16
(US$0.03), and its operating income rose 5.5% to RMB581.688 billion (US$95.57 billion). The company
made significant progress in oil and gas exploration and production and achieved steady output increases
in the third quarter. Adhering to the principles of market-orientation and profitability, PetroChina optimized
resource allocation and sought rigorously to reduce losses and increase profitability in refining and
chemicals. It also adjusted its marketing strategies to boost sales and enhance profitability by focusing on
quality and profitability.

Market Outlook
While the global economy continues to be sluggish, China's is likely to have grown by 9% in 2013, with
demand for oil and gas up by 4% as government stimulus measures continue to filter through the
economy. The EIA expects oil production to have increased by 170,000 bbl/d to 4.5 million bbl/d in 2013,
and oil consumption to have increased by 400,000 bbl/d. The EIA estimates that China will import about
75% of its crude oil by 2035, as demand is likely to grow faster than domestic production.
China's access to natural resources is an important requirement for social stability and economic growth.
China hopes that the semi-submersible CNOOC 981 rig, the first independent deepwater drilling rig
operated by a Chinese company, which began drilling in the second quarter of 2012, will reduce its
dependence on oil imports and help develop deepwater exploration technologies and equipment. Further
shale exploration will help to meet the growing domestic demand for gas and reduce the country's
dependence on imports.

India

Sector Overview
The oil and gas industry is one of the six main industries in India and plays an important role in the
economy. India increasingly relies on imported LNG, being the world's fourth largest importer, accounting
for 5.3% of global imports in 2012. It has a network of 9,537 km of crude pipeline with a capacity of 138.3
million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa). Indian Oil Co Ltd (IOCL) (BSE: IOC) has the longest crude
pipeline network, 4,376 km, 45.9% of the national total, and has the longest pipelines, the 1,870 km
Salaya-Mathura-Paripat Pipeline and the 1,302 km Haldia-Barauni or Paradip-Barauni Pipeline. ONGC
has the largest capacity, 65.5 mmtpa, or 47.4% of the national total, followed by OICL's 40.4 mmpta, or
29.2%.

The Government raised gas prices in April 2013 for the first time in three years, as it implements reforms
to boost industry, revive the economy and increase LNG imports. Raising prices nearer to world levels
could boost investment in the sector; increase much needed supply to the world's fourth-largest energy

Page134of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.user, and make LNG imports from major producers such as Qatar more attractive. Independent consulting
firm FACTS Global Energy said that it was a good time for the Government to consider raising prices
because investment in the oil and gas sector was drying up as private sector players remained cautious.
The existing contract price, US$4.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), expires on April 1, 2014,
and national elections are due by May 2014. The new rate is likely to be based on US export prices and
Japan's import numbers, possibly boosting prices by at least 60% to US$6.70 per mmBtu, which the Oil
Ministry says will still be only about half LNG import costs. The Government calculates that without the
price increase, supply will be only half of India's gas demand, which will rise from the present 286 million
cubic meters a day to 466 million cubic meters in 2016 or 2017.
Oil Sector
India had proved crude oil reserves of 5.476 billion barrels in 2013, down by 2.3% from a year earlier.
Production levels also declined, by 0.6% from 2011 to 990.2 thousand bbl/d in 2012, while consumption
rose by 6.2% to 3,621.8 thousand bbl/d.
Indian national oil companies have purchased equity stakes in overseas oil and gas fields in South
America, Africa and the Caspian Sea region to obtain reserves and production capability. Nevertheless,
most imports continue to come from the Middle East, where Indian companies have little direct access to
investment.

Natural Gas Sector

India's proved reserves of natural gas rose by 7.6% from 2012 to 43.825 Tcf in 2013, while consumption
fell by 8.2% to 2,076 Bcf, with no exports.

The country has a huge potential demand for natural gas, the penetration of which is much lower than the
global average. India wants to double the current 10% share of gas in its energy mix by 2020, and reduce
the consumption of expensive diesel and fuel oil. The finance head at LNG importer Petronet LNG Ltd
(NSE: PLNG), 50% owned by state-run firms, said that any increase in natural gas prices would help raise
the acceptability of imported LNG.

Leading Companies
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) (BSE: ONGC)
ONGC provides 72% of the country's total crude oil and 48% of natural gas production. For the fiscal half
year ended September 30, 2013, it reported 15.8% lower profit after tax of Rs100.8 billion (US$1.64
billion) compared with a year earlier, and 23.8% higher revenue of Rs100.83 billion (US$1.64 billion).
Crude oil production declined by 0.7% to 12.977 million metric tonnes, and of natural gas by 3% to
12.392 billion cubic meters, while total sales rose by 4% to Rs416.67 billion (US$6.79 billion).

ONGC's subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with
Petrovietnam (PVN) on November 20, 2013, to promote joint cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector in
Vietnam, India and other countries. The MoU is a development of the agreement signed between OVL
and Petrovietnam on October 12, 2011, when the latter offered five blocks to OVL for assessment as to
their viability.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) (BSE: RIL)
and net profit rose by 9.4% to Rs10,842 crore (US$1,767.246 million).
The company, together with BP plc (NYSE: BP), discovered gas condensate in the Cauvery basin off the
east coast of India. RIL is the operator with 70% equity and BP has a 30% share. The well CYIII-D5-S1
was drilled at a water depth of 1,743 meters to a total depth of 5,731 meters, to explore Mesozoic age
reservoirs. RIL also signed a MoU with ONGC to explore the possibility of sharing RIL's infrastructural
facility on the East Coast. The MoU aims at working out the modalities for sharing of infrastructure,
identifying additional requirements and firming up commercial terms, in line with the global practice of
sharing infrastructure.

Market Outlook
The oil and gas industry is having difficulty making enough profit to expand exploration and production
(E&P) as growing fuel subsidies, and an uncertain global economy, have burdened the industry. India is
likely to experience an energy deficit, importing 77% of its total domestic crude oil demand. The gas
deficit is likely to continue for the next six months, boosting LNG imports, while a large portion of demand
will remain unsatisfied due to price sensitivity among end users.

Page135of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Although Indian oil and gas companies are likely to explore global investment opportunities in shale gas,
this is unlikely to have any impact on improving the gas deficit situation in the near future. India is likely to
become a net importer of natural gas in the next two years if the situation does not change, risking
over-dependence on other countries and giving it little bargaining power. The Petroleum Ministry expects
imports of LNG to rise further to 50% of demand in fiscal 2013, and surpass domestic production in fiscal
2015.

Indonesia

Sector Overview
Indonesia is the world's third fastest growing economy, with its energy sector seen by the Government as
playing a key role in maintaining the country's development. Crude oil production has declined since
1998, as the largest oil fields have matured and no new comparable resources have been developed. The
Indonesian Petroleum Association (IPA) warned that oil and gas potential needs to be developed to drive
sustainable economic growth, and the country is focusing on securing energy sources for its domestic
market.

Ruby natural gas field offshore East Kalimantan (Borneo) started production through the Sebuku
production sharing contract with Mubadala Petroleum, Abu Dhabi, (70% share), Total E&P Sebuku, 15%
and Inpex South Makassar Ltd, 15%. The field will produce a peak 100 million standard cubic feet per
day (MMscfd) for four years and produce 214 bcf over 10 years. The field, in 60 m of water in the
Makassar Strait, produces from four wells in the Oligocene Berai formation. A 312-km, 14-inch, subsea
pipeline connects the Ruby platform with the Senipah terminal on East Kalimantan, operated by a
subsidiary of Total SA (PAR: FP). PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur buys the gas for use in a fertilizer plant.
Oil Sector
Indonesian crude oil proved reserves rose by 3.7% from 2012 to 4.03 billion barrels in 2013. Production
levels fell by 4.1% to 974.3 thousand bbl/d, while consumption remained the same as a year earlier at
1,384 thousand bbl/d. The remaining hydrocarbons in Indonesia are becoming harder to extract as most
are in remote spots that require lots of expensive new infrastructure and technology, and state-owned
Pertamina lacks the necessary expertise.

Natural Gas Sector

Indonesia's proved natural gas reserves fell by 23.2% from 2012 to 108.4 Tcf in 2013, while production
levels declined by 4.4% from 2010 to 3,255 Bcf in 2011, consumption by 5% to 1,327 Bcf, exports by
5.4% to 1,366 Bcf, and there were no imports in 2011.

Three new gas fields developed by Chevron Indonesia Co - Bangka field, Gendalo and Gehem, all in East
Kalimantan - are likely to begin production in 2015, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Masela block in the
Arafura Sea, north of Australia, with total reserves of 171.316 billion cubic meters and a soon to be set up
floating LNG plant, is expecting first production in 2016.

Leading Companies

PT Medco Energi Internasional Terbuka (JSX: MEDC)
Medco Energi's main activities are oil and gas exploration, development and production, power
generation and renewable fuels with operational areas in Indonesia, Cambodia, Oman, Yemen, Libya,
Tunisia and the US, including one LPG plant and three power plants. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, operating revenue declined by 1.1% from a year earlier to US$652.235 million,
gross profit by 11% to US$277.452 million, while cash flow rose 73.5% to US$196.012 million.

A wholly owned subsidiary of PT Medco Downstream Indonesia, PT Medco Ethanol Lampung, which
deals in ethanol production, closed its ethanol plant on October 16, 2013, due to insufficient supply of
feedstock such as cassava and molasses. The closure means that the company has no operating
business unit in PT Pums Medco Petroleum, a high speed diesel trading and distribution unit, so PT
Medco Downstream Indonesia and its subsidiaries no longer have downstream operations.

PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG) (JSX: MEDC)
net income by 907.7% to US$214.227 million and gross profit by 68.5% to US$244.549 million.
The company secured a new US$203 million syndicated five-year loan facility arranged by Bank of
AmericaMerrill Lynch, Bank of India and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA on December 11, 2013, with a current

Page136of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.annual interest rate of Libor +6%. The money will be used to settle most of the outstanding loan facility,
allowing ENRG to reduce interest costs up to US$26 million in 2014.

Market Outlook

Indonesia should experience strong economic growth in the next six months leading to an increase in
energy consumption. The Energy and Mineral Resources Minister estimates that state revenue from the
oil and gas sector totaled Rp350 trillion (US$28 billion) in 2013, and that coal miners and oil and gas
producers generated Rp450 trillion (US$36 billion) in state revenue. The ministry allocated Rp18.8 trillion
(US$1.5 billion), an 18.9% increase from 2012, to expand and improve energy infrastructure in 2013, as
the country wants to boost the state budget.

Japan

Sector Overview

Restoration and reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake pushed the Japanese economy to
modest recovery over the past six months. The economy started to pick up in the first half of 2013, driven
by the US recovery, a rebound in domestic stock prices and a weakening yen, optimism over the
Government's economic policy and monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. Japan was the world's biggest
importer of LNG even before the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, and now consumes a third of global
output, but ensuring reliable supplies and reasonable prices has became difficult.

Japan began producing natural gas from offshore methane hydrates in March 2013, a major breakthrough
with potentially explosive consequences for both energy markets and efforts to deal with climate change.
It is considered the world's first major breakthrough in tapping a potentially massive alternative source of
natural gas and could meet Japan's needs for 100 years. The Government plans to develop technology to
enable commercial use by 2018.
Oil Sector
Japan's crude oil proved reserves in 2013 were the same as in 2012, 0.044 billion barrels. Production
levels dropped by 0.6% from 2011 to 135.5 thousand bbl/d in 2012, while consumption rose by 5.4% to
4,714.8 thousand bbl/d, and there were no exports.

Japan has long seen a declining trend in domestic demand for petroleum products, and this continued
over the past six months due to more use of fuel-efficient vehicles and the progress of industrial
energy-saving measures. Nevertheless, the demand for petroleum products was at a similar level to that
of a year earlier because of increased demand for fuel oils for electric power stations resulting from the
suspension of nuclear power operations after Fukushima.

Natural Gas Sector

Japan's 2013 proved reserves of natural gas were the same as in 2012, 0.738 Tcf. Consumption rose in
2012 by 0.6% from a year earlier to 4,388 Bcf, imports by 4.8% to 4,314 Bcf, and there were no exports.

The nuclear plant shutdown after the Fukushima disaster forced Japan to import more LNG for power
utilities, causing short-term prices to shoot up on the spot market. Japan paid a record for LNG in April
2013 as a government pledge to boost monetary stimulus weakened the nation's currency and increased
the price of fuel imports. Japan paid Y82,477 (US$800.03) a metric tonne for the fuel in April, higher than
the previous record of Y81,089 (US$786.56) in September 2008.

Leading Companies

JX Holdings (TSE: 5020)
The company's net income rose by 234.2% to Y89,706 million (US$870.148 million) in the first half
ended September 30, 2013; net sales rose by 11.3% to Y5,777,689 million (US$56,043.583 million),
operating income by 272.8% to Y139,429 million (US$1,352.461 million), and ordinary income by
121.2% to Y176,115 million (US$1,708.316 million). Subsidiary JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration
(Offshore Malaysia) signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with Malaysia's Petronas for the 4,200
km? Deepwater Block 3F with a depth of between 150 and 1,300 meters off the northwest of Sarawak and
prospects for oil discovery. The company holds a 40% interest in the project.

Idemitsu Kosan (TSE: 5019)
The company's net income totaled Y38,814 million (US$376.496 million) in the first half year ended
September 30, 2013, compared with Y2,448 million (US$23.746 million) a year earlier due to increased
extraordinary income assisted by insurance proceeds. Its net sales rose by 14.4% to Y2,346,968 million

Page137of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.(US$22,765.59 million), ordinary income by 98.3% to Y47,398 million (US$459.761 million), and
operating income by 84.1% to Y51,439 million (US$498.958 million), due to valuation gains on
inventories resulting from increased Japanese yen-dominated crude oil prices.

Market Outlook
Japan's oil consumption is likely to remain static in the next six months. The Government is increasingly
cautious about the impact of high fuel costs on the economy, especially since the Fukushima disaster
forced utilities to return to thermal power generation. Japan is now trying to obtain shale gas from the US,
and hoping to negotiate a price cut from other resource-rich countries such as Russia, which is facing a
declining share of the European market.

South Korea

Sector Overview
South Korea is a major energy importer, mainly of oil, natural gas and coal. It is the world's fifth largest
crude oil importer and second largest LNG buyer. The Energy Ministry announced a new energy
development scheme focused on improving the financial status of state-owned companies and boosting
exploration capacity by refraining from costly M&As. It is reviewing its overseas investments in oil and gas
because of poor profitability, especially those made by Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC), Korea Gas Corp
(KOGAS) (KSE: 036460) and Korea Resources Corp (KORES) in the past five years that could lead to
asset sales to offset losses. The three state firms invested US$23.21 billion from 2008 to 2012, causing
debt-to-equity ratios to jump in 2012 compared with those in 2007. The Energy Minister said that the
country is now focusing more on the quality of its overseas resource investment rather than quantity.
Oil Sector
South Korea does not have its own oil reserves and imported 2,371.966 thousand bbl/d in 2010. Oil
demand is likely to continue to drop up to 2019, due to more stringent energy efficiency standards and a
declining population. Oil companies have upgraded refining facilities and increased upstream investment,
and have begun investing in alternative energy projects. KNOC will increase its oil inventories to 141
million barrels by 2013, with an additional 101 million barrels to be held by the Government as
international cooperative stocks.

Natural Gas Sector

South Korea's proved reserves of natural gas dropped by 0.1% from 2012 to 504.408 Tcf in 2013.
Consumption rose by 8.6% from 2011 to 1,753 Bcf in 2012, imports by 1% to 1,671 Bcf, and there were
no exports. The city gas network, which serves residential, commercial and industrial consumers,
accounts for the majority of natural gas sales, about 54% in 2011, while power generation companies
make up most of the remainder.

Leading Companies
SK Energy (KSE: 96770)
SK Energy, the largest Korean oil refiner and marketer, explores for and produces LNG domestically and
internationally. Its third quarter 2013 revenue totaled KRW11.481 trillion (US$10.33 billion), while
operating income decreased by 97% from a year earlier to KRW13.3 billion (US$11.97 million), due to
the decline caused by the worsening petrochemical market. The refining margin is likely to improve due to
increased demand in the winter season, but improvement will be limited due to the supply increase from
China and the Middle East. SK Energy is planning to secure its reputation as South Korea's leading
export company through the reinforcement of its export product portfolio and the verification of export
markets.
S-Oil Corp (KSE: 10950)
S-Oil is in the fuel, petrochemical and lubricants businesses and is one of the most competitive

Market Outlook

Page138of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.As South Korea plans to boost production at its overseas fields to 35% of imports by 2020, to strengthen
energy security, the Government is introducing comprehensive measures to reduce oil consumption,
which greatly affects economic growth. The measures include boosting production of more fuel-efficient
cars, tax exemptions for buyers of hybrid cars and small vehicles, and increasing tax deductions by KRW1
million (US$9,000) for public transport users who make payments through credit or transportation cards.
The Government hopes that the measures will reduce oil consumption by 26 million barrels up to 2015,
and cut dependence on oil to 33% of all energy consumption in 2015, from the estimated 37.5% in 2012.
At the same time, South Korea has made the development of shale gas and electricity storage systems
the new economic growth engines, and is looking to tap overseas shale gas. The Ministry of Knowledge
Economy wants to expand imports of the new fossil fuel to 20% of all natural gas imports by 2020, hoping
that the development will reduce the price of liquefied natural gas and the money spent on gas imports.
