QANTAS faces a fresh round of market turbulence after revealing foreign investment in the airline is
almost at its upper limit, denying the company a key source of financial support.

The flag carrier has announced foreigners now hold 47.8 per cent of its shares, closing in on the 49
per cent cap imposed by the QantasSale Act.

That compares with 44.7 per cent in September and less than 44 per cent a month earlier, with US
investor Franklin Resources now accounting for 17.56 per cent.

Foreign investors will be blocked from buying into the airline once the offshore ownership level hits
the 49 per cent threshold.
It comes at a tough time for Qantas, which in August posted a record $2.8 billion full-year loss,
weighed down by its ailing international arm and the high Australian dollar.

Analysts said the Australian stockmarket relied on healthy support from overseas – something
Qantas and its boss Alan Joyce (pictured) could no longer lean on.

“Qantas won’t get the support it could normally expect from overseas,” CMC Markets strategist
Michael McCarthy said.
He said the recent drop in global oil prices had bolstered Virgin’s shares, which are up 7 per cent in
the past week. But Qantas had shed 4.3 per cent during the same period.

Qantas shares closed 3.7 per cent lower yesterday at $1.30 – the lowest level in more than six
weeks – while Virgin fell 0.5¢, or 1.3 per cent, to 38¢.The broader ASX 200 fell 32.8 points to 5155.5
points, despite better-than-expected trade data out of China boosting mining stocks.
