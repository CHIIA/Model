Shares in Perth-based oil and gas company Range Resources gained nearly 20 per cent on the
ASX after it announced it had attracted the backing of Hong Kong-based institutional investment
group Abraham.
Range said Abraham would subscribe for $US12 million worth of the company's shares, at £0.01
per share, representing a premium of approximately 49 per cent to the mid-market share price.

Abraham will be issued about 712 million Range shares, equating to a stake of around 15 per cent
of the company once the transaction is settled.
The funds will be used to repay existing debt of about US$10.5 million and remaining proceeds to
be used for general working capital of the company.
"The $US12 million subscription will allow us to refinance the expensive and dilutionary corporate
debt and provide working capital as we move forward with Range's operational and long term
financing objectives," Range chief executive Rory Scott Russell said.
The subscription will occur in two equal tranches, both worth US$6 million.
Range will also issue about 237 million options to Abraham, half of which will be at the exercise
price of £0.01 and half at £0.02.
The company's shares rose as high as 1.5 cents following the announcement, before slipping back
to 1.3 cents at 10:45AM, WST.
Range Resources' flagship project is three oil and gas exploration licences in Trinidad, while it also
holds assets in Guatemala, Georgia, Texas and Colombia.
