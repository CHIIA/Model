*China's official CPI rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics reported,
the same pace as in December. The PPI fell 1.6%. China's economic data are distorted in January and
February by the week long Lunar New Year holiday.

*Our market is responding positively to our profit reports and dividend lifts, both of which are higher almost
across the board on the previous reports. Also encouraging is the US market's shrugging off the on the
whole their weak eco reports today.
China's official CPI contained no (negative) revisions.

"Resistance at 5330, support at 5305, for the day I will call us up 30 points"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500 had quite a large range last night of nearly
20 points, closing on its highs. It has crossed back above the 20, 0 and 100 day moving averages, as I
pointed out yesterday. It ran into resistance at 1830. A close around here on the week could see the
previous highs tested in the next week or two with 1850 the next target.
"Gold had another decent night last night and is testing $1302 currently. It is short term bullish after the
breakout of the downtrend. If it can close above $1300 for the week it will be pretty bullish. The next level
of resistance is 1320 followed by 1360.
"Copper is short term neutral - pulled back from $3.40 a pound in late December, testing the $3.20 level
which is good support and is sitting at $3.25, still trading short term neutral. $3.20/lb needs to hold other
wise a break would see it back to 43.15 or $3.10. The next level of resistance is $3.30/lb.
"The Chinese market tried to go on with it yesterday but failed and closed below 2100. If it fails to close
above 2100 it will go back and test 2050 which should prove good support. (China's CPI report is also due
out today).

"The ASX looked like a strong day yesterday but saw a late sell off. Resistance is at 5330.

Page211of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."If we can close around or above 5335 it would be bullish. There is major resistance at 3350 followed by
5400. Short term it is still bullish. The momentum indicators are also quite strong still.

"For the day resistance is at 5330, support at 5305. There is further resistance at 5350.

"For the day I will call us up 30 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 2 points to 5308.1 last evening.

Market conditions and outlook

Page215of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The company said in its largest scrap sourcing market the US economic activity is slowly improving, but
despite positive leading indicators US scrap metal generation remains weak.

Ferrous and non ferrous markets ended stronger than they started in first half 2014. "Entering the second
half of fiscal 2014 ferrous market trading conditions are challenging. Severe winter weather conditions in
North America have restricted industry ability to collect and process at normal levels .. also the steep
deterioration in the currency of many emerging market economies impacted negatively on export demand
early in the second half of fiscal 2014, most notably in Turkey". A focus on business practices is expected
to drive further cost efficiencies.

While economic activity appears to be improving across the majority of the regions where SGM operates,
the benefits are yet to be seen in any meaningfdul way in the metals recycling industry.

Analysts expectations: U'lyig profit $A30 mln, no div/$54 mln, no div/$32.3 mln 13.5c div.
*A leading broker on February 12 retained a "buy" on Sims Metal with a $12 price target. The broker said
it is reducing its 2014/15 estimated profits by 4/5% to incorporate a more cahllenging trading environment
for North American scrap exports as margins and end markets, esoecialy Trkey that usually accounts for
20/25% of North American exports, remains weak, partly offset by improved trading conditions in Australia
and realisation of restructuring benefits in Europe.
*On January 14 a leading broker with a "buy" on Sims Group and a price target of $12.84 said key
ownside risks include continued pressure on scrap prices and margins, unexpected scrap price declines,
further appreciation of the $A/$US and slower than expected growth in e-recycling.

*TPI: Interim NPAT up 297.9%, no div, debt reduction priority, outlook positive
Transpacific Industries Group for the half year ended December 31 2013 announced a net profit from
continuing and discontinued operations after tax up 297.9% to $167.1 million on revenue down 5.1% to
$726.9 million. No interim dividend has been proposed.

NTA backing per security is 60.6c vs 9.2c for the June half.
During the year, on August 30 2013, the group sold its Commercial Vehicles Group booking a loss on
the sale of $122.2 million.
Cleanaway underlying EBITDA rose 2% to $98.6 million on revenue up 0.6%to $467.7 million.
Industrials revenue fell 8.9% to $246.9 million, underlying EBITDA fell 24.3% to $44.8 million.
Total New Zealand revenues rose 4.9% to $NZ226 million.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 10.6% to $NZ46.1 million.
Operating cash flow fell 25.3% to $89.7 million vs a gain of 20.8% to $120 million for the previous
corresponding half.
Consolidated group net debt reduced to $753.9 million from $977.5 million in the prior period. Debt
reduction remains a key priority.

Outlook

Recently appointed CEO Robet Boucher said in the report based on current assessments, the Australian
and NZ trading conditions are expected to remain consistent with those experienced in the first half. In
addition the company will achieve its $20 mln cost savings target and $35 mln interest cost savings in full
year 2014.

Analysts expectations: $32 mln, no div/$36.9 mln no div. .
*UGL: UGL Group reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: (full yr)$108.5 mln.

*On January 30 a leading broker said after a decade long bull run for the engineering and construction
sector, "We see risk that management teams are still too optimistic on a 2nd half 2014 plus market
recovery.

The broker said the greatest risks are for Monadelphous, Leighton, Transfield and UGL, which along with
Downer are all rated "underweight" by the broker, with WorleyParsons the only overweight.

Page216of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The broker's order of preference remains Worley No. 1, target price $17.93 up from $17.34, Downer No.
2. Target price $4.10 up from $3.68, Transfield Services No. 3, target price 78c down from 80c, UGL No.
4, target price $5.73 up from $5.60, Monadelphous No. 5 price target $12.50 down from $13.29 and
Leighton No. 6, price target steady at $13.03.

*Another leading broker on January 28 retained a "sell" on UGL with a target price of $6.30. The broker
said while it is attracted to UGL's exposure to recurring/maintenance work, it does not believe the
demerger adds value, given the significant one off costs, higher recurring corporate costs and the fact that
current multiples are not underestimating value.

LARGE CAP RESOURCES

*MML: Fatality underground
Medusa Mining Ltd regretfully advised of a fatality underground at the Co-O underground mine rock when
a dislodged large rock hit a contractor's assistant. All aid was given first in the company's hospital and
then transported to the Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.
All government departments have been notified and the company is providing a full range of support
services to his family. (Feb 13)
*NCM: Newcrest Mining Ltd for the first half to December 31 2013 announced a statutory profit of $40
million vs $323 million for the previous corresponding period (pcp).
Underlying profit was $A207 million vs $323 mln for the pcp. On sales revenue up 12% to $2.016 billion.
A 26% increase in gold sales offset a 13% reduction in the average realised gold price.

No interim dividend was announced.
Cash flow was $228 million, free cash flow was negative $229 million.
A $47 million after tax impairment was taken for the West African exploration assets.

EBITDA margin was 36%, EBIT margin was 20%. Gearing was 30.5% as of December 31 2013.
Cash and undrawn debt facilities as at December 31 was $A1.250 billion. Average debt maturity profile is
7 years.
Gold production increased 27% to 1,2 million ozs, copper production increased 10% to 42Kt, all in
sustaining costs (AISC) were $A1,003/oz, average realised gold price was $A1,405 per oz - a $A400 per
oz margin to the AISC.

Guidance: CEO Greg Robinson said in the report overall the focus remains on optimising its current
operations, maintaining its growth options and maximising free cash flow to reduce gearings and return
to paying dividends.
2014 gold production is expected to be around the top end of guidance range at around 2.3 million ozs.
Gold resources fell 7% to 161M ozs, copper resources fell 1% to 21 million tonnes.
Gold reserves fell 1% to 78 million ozs and copper reserves fell 3% to 12 Million tonnes.

Analysts expectations: $210 mln, no div/$172.1 mln, no div.

*On January 30 a leading broker lifted its price target for Newcrest from $11.60 to $12 while maintaining
an "overweight". The broker said debt refinance is needed and assumed in its forecast, production trends
are positive, all assets are contributing - "gold price is the ongoing risk" the broker said in the report.

*On January 20 a leading broker lifted its rating on Newcrest from "sell" to "Neutral" and the price target
from $6.90 to $11.20 and then reduced the price target to 410.80 on January 24.
The rise from "sell" to "neutral" was after the broker lifted its long term gold and copper price forecasts, to
$US1,300/oz of gold and copper to $US2.95/lb from $US2.55 per lb.

The later cut in price target was that while Newcrest in its December quarter production report mintained
production guidance, end of December debt was likely to be higher.
*PRU: Perseus Group reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $4.8 mln no div/ (full yr) neg $16 mln.

Page217of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*A leading broker had an "add" on Perseus on January 30.

*On January 28 a leading broker raised its target price to 35c from 26c for Perseus after the pre release of
the December quarterly, and retained a "neutral" recommendation. The broker said Perseus was
improving operationally but further cost outs were required.
*Also on January 28 a leading broker retained a "buy" on Perseus, lifting its p[rice target to $1.10 from $1.
The broker said it maintains its buy call based on valuation. While there is value in the company's assets
given the large resource base, recent share price volatility and gold price uncertainty is likely to keep
investors on the sidelines. In our view, the downside appears limited, but delivery could take another year.

*PDN: Net loss for half year higher as expected, 2014 prod guidance reduced
Paladin Energy Ltd for the half year ended December 31 2013 announced a net loss of $US255 million
vs a loss for the previous corresponding period (pcp) of $US193.5 million on revenue down 12% to

the cost of production down 8% at Langer Heinrich to $US27.5/lb.

Kayelekera C1 cost of production fell 4% to $US33.1/lb in the December quarter (Kayelekera has now

were completed, further measures are to be implemented. The Queensland exploration assets have been
impaired by $US226.5 million after tax.

Revised 2014 production guidance

Revised 2014 production guidance is 7.8/8Mlb Ue3O8 down from 8.3/8.7Mlb U3O8 earlier.
In January 2014 the sale of a 25% stake in Langer Heinrich Mine was completed, for $US190 million, the
proceeds will be used to repay debt. (Feb 13)

Analysts expectations: Neg $US34.7 mln, no div.
*On February 10 following the placing of Kayelekera Mine on care and maintenance until uranium prices
recover, a leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Paladin with a 60c price target. The broker said
atspot prices and without further cost out, Kayelekera Mine (KM) would burn cash. "We assume KM
remains shut until 2nd half 2015. Our spot uranium price forecast rises to $US50/lb at that point, offering
a 20% C1 margin from the KM operation. Until then PDN expects to spend $US12 million per year in site
maintenance costs and incur a $US32 million impairment as a result of the KM suspension" the broker
said in the report.

The broker said PDN's moves to address balance sheet risk have been positive, but it needs to see a
sustained price recovery before becoming more positive on the stock.

continue.
The largest contributor to earnings was the iron ore group with underlying earnings of $US9.858 billion,
up 7% on the previous year, attributable to record sales volumes in the Pilbara, a weaker $A, marginally
higher prices and cost savings initiatives.

2014 production guidance
for iron ore: 295 million tonnes on a 100% basis vs 266 tonnes in 2013 when RIO's share was 209
million tonnes.
for mined and refined copper production is expected to be 570,000 tonnes mined and 260,000 tonnes
refined production respectively, down 10% on 2013 mainly to divestments while a planned smelter
maintenance shutdown at Kennecott Utah Copper will be partly offset by increased production at Oyy
Tolgoi
for hard coking coal, semi soft coking coal, thermal coal and uranium are expected to be 8.5Mt hard
coking, 3Mt semi soft coking and 16.5Mt thermal coal excluding Clermont.
Uranium production is expected to be lower as process plant operations are restored at ERA and
Rossing.

Rio expects to produce 1.5Mt of titanium dioxide feedstocks, 0.5Mt of boric oxide equivalent and 16M
carats of diamonds.
Analysts expectations: Following the result : *Rio's results were seen as boosted by a lower $A for its iron
ore and other Australia based exports while revenue was below analysts expectations, according to
media reports in London last night.
*Bank of America/Merrill Lynch downgraded Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) from Buy to Neutral following the
result.
Forecasts: $US7.033 billion, div for full yr 183.5c/$US9.865 bln..
*Nomura in its report on January 24 had a "buy" on Rio Tinto with a target price of $A 85. The broker said
while reiterating its "buy" for Rio Tinto it has removed it as top pick, with BHP now in that position.
"Macroeconomic risks for Rio .. remain pronounced as the miner is most exposed to iron ore and thus
any weakening in the Chinese macroeconomic outlook in our view. Additionally we expect the aluminium
market will likely remain weak".

*On January 22 a leading broker had an "equal weight" on RIO with a price target of $44, up from $41
earlier.
*Deutsche Bank on January 16 had a price target of $86 on RIO and a "buy" recommendation.
Deutsche Bank expected underlying earnings of $US9.87 billion against consensus of $US9.7 billion, a
10% rise in the full-year dividend to 183 cents per share against consensus of 181 cents and a decline in
net debt to $US19.4 billion against consensus of $21 billion.
"We believe the result will include negative one-offs totalling circa $4-5 billion ($2.5 billion occurred in
the first half), including further asset impairments (mostly aluminium), however all one-offs are non-cash
and as such will be largely ignored by the market," he adds, rating the stock a 'buy'.
