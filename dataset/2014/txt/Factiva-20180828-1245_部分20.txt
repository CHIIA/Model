19 August 2014 – BHP Billiton Plc (LON:BLT, ASX:BHP) has started negotiations with suitors for its
Nickel West business in Australia that could see the Anglo-Australian mining giant sell the entire unit or
portions of it, the company’s chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said as quoted by Reuters today.
The company is in talks with several interest parties for the unit, which it decided to offload following a
major structure overhaul.

According to analysts quoted by Reuters, among the potential buyers could be X2 Resources, an
investment vehicle set up by mining entrepreneur Mick Davis, China’s MMG Ltd (HKG:1208), Canada
Sherritt International Corp (TSE:S) and Dutch commodities trader Trafigura Beheer BV.

The world’s largest miner started examining options for the Nickel West division in May. The business
consists of the Mt Keith, Cliffs and Leinster mines and associated concentrators, the Kalgoorlie smelter,
Kambalda concentrator and the Kwinana refinery.
BHP Billion is currently spinning of its aluminum, coal, manganese and solver operations in Colombia
to roll them into a new company as part of a drive to simplify its portfolio.
