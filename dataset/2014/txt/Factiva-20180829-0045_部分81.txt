Australia's QGC, a subsidiary of UK-based BG Group, has started up the network of upstream gas
processing facilities that will feed its $20.4 billion Queensland Curtis LNG project off the eastern
Australian port city of Gladstone.

The new facilities will mainly process output from QGC's coalbed methane fields in Queensland's
onshore Surat and Bowen basins.

The seven new facilities comprise six field compression stations feeding gas drawn from hundreds of
CBM wells into the larger Ruby Jo Central processing plant, and thence to Curtis Island through a
540-km underground pipeline network.

"This milestone was achieved to schedule and keeps us firmly on track to be the world's first bespoke
project to produce LNG sourced from coal seams, with first LNG production due in the final quarter of
this year," said QGC boss Mitch Ingram.

The new processing facilities are the first to start operating under a contract QGC awarded to Australian
engineering, construction and mining services company Thiess last September to build 17 field
compression stations and four central processing plants at three hubs in the Surat Basin.
The 8.5 million mt/year Queensland Curtis liquefaction and export facility, being built on Curtis Island
off Gladstone, is targeting first LNG in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Under a $1.9 billion deal completed in November 2013 China's state owned China National Offshore
Oil Corporation agreed to increase its equity stake in QCLNG Train 1 to 50% from 10%, to raise its
equity interest in some of BG's Surat Basin reserves and resources from 5% to 25% and the option to
participate as a 25% partner in one of the potential expansion trains at QCLNG.
