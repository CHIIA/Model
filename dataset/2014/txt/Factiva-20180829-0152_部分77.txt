The S&P/ASX200 closed down 1 point to 316 on light volume worth $2.8 billion. There were 486 issues
higher and 447 down. The SPI Futures closed down 8 points to 287 on light volume of 13,634 contracts.
Aussie 10 year bond yields were steady at 4.31%. The $A is at 89.29US c, up about 10 points on last
evening.

*The banks contributed 1.9 negative points to the index, resources contributed 3.8 negative points,
property trusts contributed 0.5 positive points, retailers contributed 1.6 positive points and Telstra was
Neutral.

Our market lacks inspiration a few days into the New Year, with no dramatic moves anywhere and many
players still missing. Caution prevails, with the banks where p/es had risen too far being neglected, miners
down as China is slowing and growth in Europe and the US unlikely to have much impact on the sector -
and the outlook for emerging markets is troubled. Europe and US facing stocks were among the winners.

Short term rally, medium term weakness expected ..

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" (thankyou Daniel) said today, "Short term
outlook: While the evidence continues to favor a new rally high in due course .. the red flags are out
including ripe sentiment, low investor participation and bearish leadership on the asset, index and sector
fronts... I have 5500 by the middle of next week as a very tentative target for a top.

"Medium tem outlook: The psychological trend remains down definitively from a NeoWave viewpoint ..
expect a further increase in volatility going forward. I expect the ASX 200 will bottom in late 2016 near
4300 points ..

"Long term outlook: My tentative long term count suggests a multi decade advance with minimum relative
retracement is due to commence sometime this decade, potentially as early as 2016 or between
2018-2020".

"Support at 5315, resistance 5325 next at 5345, up 15 on the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500 is still in uptrend. Resistance now is at the
1840 mark and then the previous high which was 1850. It could test the previous high, however it is likely
to consolidate into the reporting season.

"The German Dax has quite a similar chart to the S&P500. There was a bit of profit taking last week, but it
is regaining its losses and is likely to re-test the highs. The European markets are looking firmly in tact.

"In Japan, the market is still in uptrend although they have had a couple of days of sell off. However it is
currently testing the 20 day moving average which has been good support, at 15,756 - worth keeping an
eye on 15,756- if that breaks it will be short term bearish for Japan.

Page211of276©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."With regard to gold. $1250 is resistance - it had the first negative night last night. It is still a bit of a dead
cat bounce. Last night could be the first move down. Support is at $1218. A break of $1218 could see it
test $1200 again.

"To our market, we had another weak performance yesterday, closing on the lows. The chart after
recovering December losses looks like it is trending down. The RSI also indicates that.

"I expect support at yesterday's low of 5315. Resistance now should be 5325, next at 5340. Underlying
weakness in our market continues compared to the global market. Resources are likely to remain weak,
household names and leaders probably will provide support.

"For the day I will call us up 15 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 7.9 points to 5317 last evening.

*OGC: Lowers prod from Macraes, full yr prod guidance down slightly
OceanaGold Corporation announced the board of directors has approved a new mine schedule for the
Macraes Goldfield located in the Otago region on the South Island of New Zealand. As a result of the
prolonged and sustained drop in the gold price, the company has re optimised the Macraes mine plan to
further reduce costs in order to sustain operations. The new mine plan includes a reduction in the total
material movement scheduled in the open pit, resulting in lower equipment usage and a reduction in
operating and support staff requirements over the next two years.

Managing director and CEO Mick Wikes said in the report, "The Macraes Goldfield has been operating
continuously for over 23 years, producing over 3.8 million ozs of gold. During its life, Macraes has been a
major employer and contributor to the Otago region and local economy. He said the lower gold price has
necessitated the need to make changes to the business to ensure a sustainable operation at Macraes
which will also unfortunately have an impact on some of the workforce and contractors whose contribution
he acknowledged and thanked them for.

In 2014 the company plans to produce 275,000/305,000 ozs of gold at cash costs of $US400/450 and
