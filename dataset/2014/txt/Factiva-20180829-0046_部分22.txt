Rich 200 2014
Roy Manassen's wealth is largely attributed to his grocery business, Manassen Foods, valued at
$530 million in 2011 when Chinese food giant Bright Foods acquired a 75 per cent stake. The firm was
started by his father Simon from the back of a van in 1952. Cadbury first bought Manassen Fine Foods in
1986 but Roy orchestrated an employee buyback two years later. In 2006 CHAMP Private Equity took a
stake. The Bright Foods deal leaves Manassen with 15 per cent share and CHAMP 10 per cent. Bright
Foods is hunting for acquisitions, especially in the sought-after dairy sector. Through Manassen Foods it
has bought WA cheese and yoghurt producer Mundella. The Manassen Group holds more than 70
brands including Sunbeam and Angas Park dried fruits,the Margaret River Dairy Company, and Ryvita
and McVities biscuits.
