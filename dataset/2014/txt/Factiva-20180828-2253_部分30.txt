0349 GMT [Dow Jones] The Reserve Bank of Australia was "never likely to be a scrooge and bump up
interest rates just before Christmas," says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. He notes that
Australia's economy remains fairly robust "but with tepid growth in Europe and China, as well as the
continuing geopolitical tensions around the world, there are enough threats out there for the bank to keep
the pause button pressed." While the country's mining sector continues to weaken, non-mining
conditions are improving steadily, while the housing market remains strong. "Exactly when the RBA will
decide to hike interest rates is difficult to predict, but the middle of next year, potentially at a similar time
to the U.S. Federal Reserve, might not be too wide of the mark," he says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com;

0340 GMT [Dow Jones] Stocks in Japan are on a tear but its own investors are selling at a record pace,
a sign of lack of domestic support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic revival program. Japanese
retail investors sold $24 billion of stocks over the past five weeks--the highest since as far back as
1993--even as foreign investors continued to invest for the fifth straight week, according to data by JP
Morgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Foreign investors have bought $33 billion in Japanese stocks
in that period, according to Japan's Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei Stock Average has leapt 12% since
the Bank of Japan announced fresh stimulus for the economy at the end of October.

0337 GMT [Dow Jones] The market is closely watching today's auction of 10-year Japanese government
bonds to measure whether the move Monday by Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Japan's credit
rating has cooled bullish sentiment toward JGBs. The finance ministry will announce the result at 0345
GMT. The lowest accepted price for 10-year debt, totalling around Y2.4 trillion, will likely come to around
100.26, traders say. With coupons and yields at low levels, "it is hard to predict how investors will
respond," says Tokai Tokyo Securities chief bond strategist Kazuhiko Sano, adding that the result of the
auction "will likely influence the direction of prices over the short-term." The latest issue carries a coupon
of 0.5%, unchanged from the previous tender in November. Lead December JGB futures are down 0.15
at 146.75. (takashi.nakamichi@wsj.com)

0328 GMT [Dow Jones] NZD/USD benefited from an overnight slide in the U.S. dollar and there "is
clearly a lot of demand out there for the New Zealand dollar," says Sam Tuck, ANZ senior currency
manager. The pair is at 0.7866 and Tuck says it remains relatively rangebound between 0.7700 and
0.8000 so "anywhere up around 0.7900 people start to find importer offers and anywhere below 0.7800
you'd probably start to find exporter bids." He notes the ANZ commodity price index declined 1.6% but

justify why the New Zealand hasn't been really punished on the commodities story like the Aussie dollar
in the last few days." He says investors will now be focused on the overnight GlobalDairyTrade auction.

0327 GMT [Dow Jones] After swinging back to a small surplus of $0.02 billion in October, Indonesia's
monthly trade balance may continue to improve to between $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion in coming
months due to the drop in price for oil, says Citi. "Since November, oil prices continued sliding while
non-oil commodity prices e.g. coal and palm oil stabilized," it adds. Indonesia is a net oil importer and
major exporter of thermal coal and palm oil. (I-made.sentana@wsj.com)

0321 GMT [Dow Jones] India's rupee could keep weakening versus the U.S. dollar in the near term, the
daily USD/INR chart suggests. USD/INR is likely to keep rising if it holds on to the 61.94 support level
that is the base of the daily Bollinger uptrend channel. The uptrend channel may lead USD/INR to the
monthly Bollinger uptrend channel at 62.93. The Reserve Bank of India's interest rate decision due at
0530 GMT could be key to the rupee's next move. The central bank is likely to keep its base lending rate
unchanged after a strong manufacturing PMI released Monday. USD/INR may spike to the 9-month high
of 62.24 reached on Friday if the typically-hawkish central bank surprises the market with an interest rate
cut. USD/INR closed Monday at 61.95. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0322 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are lower, weighed by profit-taking after recent
gains, says a local trader. But the recent bullish trend of bonds has not yet ended after the yields of local
bonds fell below key support levels on technical charts, the trader says. "The low interest rate
environment will likely last longer than we had expected, that will keep pushing bond prices higher," he
adds. Some funds are also shifting to local bonds from stocks after the ruling Kuomintang party suffered
a larger-than-expected defeat in local elections Saturday. The most-traded 10-year bond yield rises to
1.5815% from 1.5780% late Monday; the five-year bond yield is at 1.0895% versus 1.0690%. The Taiex
is 1.0% lower. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0319 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia's rupiah falls for a seventh consecutive day, reaching a low last seen
in January. The rupiah has been slipping on a deterioration of general investor sentiment associated with
falling oil prices and weak China manufacturing purchasing managers' indexes released yesterday.
USD/IDR is now inside the daily Bollinger uptrend channel--a signal suggesting the rupiah is likely to fall
further against the U.S. dollar in the near term. A strong inflation number released Monday has raised
expectations that Bank Indonesia might have to hike interest rates again to stem price increases. The
central bank on November 18 raised its benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to counter the
inflationary effects of the government's fuel subsidy cut. USD/IDR is now 12,275 from its Monday close
of 12,270. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0311 GMT [Dow Jones] Total wages of an average Japanese employee--consisting of base pay,
overtime and bonuses--increased 0.5% in October, extending the streak of year-on-year gains to the
eighth month, the longest stretch since 1997, labor ministry data showed Tuesday. The gain slowed from
the previous month's 0.7% rise, but the positive trend isn't expected to change anytime soon amid
growing pressure on employees to keep up wages in line with inflation. With import prices pushed up by
a weaker yen, the month's total wages still represent a decline of 2.8% on an inflation-adjusted basis, the
data showed. (mitsuru.obe@wsj.com)

0300 GMT [Dow Jones] The yuan rises slightly after the central bank guides the currency stronger via a
daily reference rate. The yuan is at 6.1507 versus 6.1520 at Monday's close. The central parity is set at
6.1325 versus 6.1369 Monday on the dollar's weakness overseas. "But you can see lots of yuan selling
in the market, indicating investors are bearish about the currency despite the PBOC's efforts," says a
Shanghai-based trader at a foreign bank. Offshore, one-year USD/CNY non-deliverable forwards are
down at 6.2590/6.2620 from 6.2605/6.2625 late Monday. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0257 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/TWD is slightly higher, lifted by foreign investor buying, but exporter
sales are still capping gains near 31.050, says a local trader. "The local currency is also dampened by
weaker local shares, which are extending losses after elections," the trader adds. Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang party suffered a larger-than-expected defeat in local elections Saturday; foreign investors
turned net sellers of local stocks Monday after being net buyers for nine straight sessions. The
USD/TWD is at 31.040, slightly higher than 31.030 traded before the local central bank's suspected
intervention Monday, which lifted it to 31.139--its highest onshore closing in 50 months, traders say. The
Taiex is down 1.0%. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0238 GMT [Dow Jones] Despite concerns over the impact of short-term global uncertainties and volatile
oil prices on the oil and gas industry, the long-term outlook remains positive, Singapore's trade minister
S. Iswaran says at an energy conference. He said Asia Pacific alone accounts for one-quarter of global
exploration spending, expected to hit $723 billion in 2014. The sector had a total output of S$21 billion
in Singapore alone last year, Mr. Iswaran says. (Eric.Yep@wsj.com)
