Hotels: Hotelier Jerry Schwartz has finalised the sale of the 250-room Holiday Inn at Sydney Airport,
which has been purchased by Hong Kong interests for $53 million.
Dr Schwartz listed the property after securing the rights to buy one of Australia’s largest hotels for
$360 million from Lend Lease as part of Darling Habour’s $2.5 billion redevelopment.

The country’s largest private hotel investor, Dr Schwartz will bankroll a five-star, 35-floor hotel to be
run by French hotelier Accor as a Sofitel.
The 616-room property is expected to open in late 2016.
The sale of the Holiday Inn, brokered by JLL’s Mark Durran, allowed for the redirection of funds into
that project.
The Sydney airport hotel market has continued to record high levels of occupancy, despite the
opening of a Rydges Hotel last year. Year to date occupancy rates above 80 per cent have been
sustained.
The sale of the Holiday Inn Sydney Airport comes as Canberra rich-lister Nick Georgalis completed
the sale of his Abode Hotel property in Woden.
Mr Georgalis’s GEOCON will continue to manage the hotel, known as Juliana House, which was
sold for $28.8m to a Melbourne-based group with a number of international interests. This is that
group’s first Canberra acquisition.
GEOCON purchased the property in 2012 and opened the 151-room apartment-style hotel late in
2013 after a lengthy refurbishment.
The sale was also brokered by Mark Durran, with fellow JLL agent Greg Lyons and CBRE.
Mr Georgalis, GEOCON’s managing director, said the decision to sell and lease back the hotel would
help the business grow.
“We have a number of exciting residential projects and new Abode hotels coming to market next
year and this will definitely allow us to progress our vision to build in Canberra,” he said.
Elsewhere, the 844-room Rydges Hotel in Melbourne’s Bell City precinct will be rebranded as a
Mantra and BreakFree from late December following its acquisition by Elanor Investors Group.The
Bell City site consists of two towers, a 383-room 4.5 star hotel which will carry the Mantra brand, and
a larger 461-room tower which will become a 3.5 star BreakFree hotel.
