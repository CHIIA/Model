A SECOND mystery bidder has approached Roc Oil for takeover talks, complicating any plans to merge
with Horizon Oil.
ROC Oil confirmed late Thursday it had received a second takeover offer, separate to an approach made
by an unnamed party late in June.

"Roc advises it has received a second confidential, unsolicited, indicative and incomplete proposal in
relation to the acquisition of all the issued share capital of Roc, independent of the indicative and
non-binding approach announced on 25 June 2014," the company said in its statement.
The takeover offer complicates any plans for an $800 million merger between Roc and fellow energy
company Horizon Oil.
Horizon and Roc Oil have proposed a merger that would create a company with assets across China,
Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand.

Roc on Thursday said it had notified Horizon of the latest approach.
The company would not publicly reveal who was behind the takeover bids, but said a media report that
the latest approach was from Cliq Energy was wrong.

Roc is due on Friday to hold an extraordinary general meeting over the Horizon merger proposal.

Roc's shares on Thursday closed, prior to its latest announcement, 2.5 cents lower at 56.5 cents.
