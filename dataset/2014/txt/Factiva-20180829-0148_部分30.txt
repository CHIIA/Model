The S&P/ASX 200 as at 2:06pm: down 30.8 to 5300.7

ASX is in latter stages of 8th wave down, should peak shortly ..

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" (thankyou Daniel) said today, "according to
my current interpretation the ASX200 is in the latter stages of an 8th wave down which should peak
shortly. In terms of the price pattern itself, it may conclude at a lower high in early ti mid 2014. This warns
us to expect a further increase in volatility going forward.

"I expect the ASX200 will bottom in late 2016 near 4300 points ..

"My long term count suggests a secular bull market (a multi decade advance with minimum relative
retracement throughout its duration) is due to commence sometime this decade, potentially as early as
2016 or between 2018-2020".

GUD remains a "hold"/a "neutral" ..

A leading broker retained a "hold" on GUD following its interim result with a price target of $6.15, down
from $6.76 earlier. The broker said while GUD is a potential turnaround story, "While we believe the
issues in Dexion will be addressed via the relocation of manufacturing capacity, Sunbeam is a more
difficult task (especially in an environment of a potentially softer $A)".

earlier. The broker said the first half result was slightly better than GUD's guidance for a 30% fall. While
consumer products were in line with the broker's bearish estimates, all other divisions under performed.

The broker said the turnaround of Sunbeam and Dexion appear hard to achieve while automotive
products were the key positive, with the market share increased due to the exit of a major competitor.

The broker added it was unsure of GUD's strategy to achieve margin expansion .. given the relative
newness of the management team".

GUD up 8c to $5.82.

Diggers & Drillers

Paladin lifted to "equal weight" from "underweight" ..

A leading broker lifted its rating for Paladin to "equal weight" from "underweight" with the price target lifted
to 60c from 48c.
The broker said although the deal value for 25% of Langer Heinrich sale to China National Nuclear Corp
fell short of its expectations by 19%, it is 7% above a 2013/29019 spot price scenario.

However the balance sheet relief is still substantial the broker says with full year 2015 gearing reduced
from 43% to 32%. The cash injection also allows pdn to meet its November 2015 CB maturity ($US300
million) through and cash flow, on the broker's estimates.

PDN down .3c to 55.7c.

Saracen a "hold" but longer term .. "we will look to upgrade our view" ..
A leading broker following Saracen's acquisition of the Thunderbox and Bannockburn gold mines from
Norilsk for $23 million, increasing SAR's mineral resources to 6Mozs and group reserves to 1.6M ozs of
gold said it was a good deal for SAR, equating to $11/oz acquisition cost but the real value doesn't
come onto SAR's balance sheet until mid 2016, which limits immediate cashflow upside.

"We're positive on the deal but we maintain our Hold on the stock as we see limited value upside in the
short term, but longer term and with easing macro headwinds we will look to upgrade our view" the broker
said in the report.

SAR up 3c to 25.5c.
