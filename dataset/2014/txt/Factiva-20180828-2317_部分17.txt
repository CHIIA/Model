2114 GMT [Dow Jones ] Bell Potter cuts its price target for BC Iron (BCI.AU) by 38% to A$1.80/share,
saying investors need a healthy appetite for risk following a dreadful quarter featuring disruptions at its
Western Australian mines. "With a market capitalization and enterprise value of A$196 million and
A$118 million, respectively, BC Iron is trading at a similar value to other iron ore explorers/developers
listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ," the broker says. "At these levels, BC Iron represents
cheap iron ore leverage, with a 10% change in our price estimates, leading to a 40-50% change to our
valuation." As BC Iron ramps up annual production back to 6 million tons, the miner should generate
positive operating cash flow, Bell Potter says. Still, the broker says risks to its buy call include persistently
weak iron-ore prices and widening of pricing discounts. BCI last traded at A$1.075.

2204 GMT [Dow Jones ] Regis Resources 's (RRL.AU) strong start to FY15 is a big step toward
rebuilding confidence shaken by problems including flooding at its Western Australian mines and a hefty
writedown against projects including its McPhillamys gold deposit in New South Wales state. Still, J.P.
Morgan says it prefers the risk-reward balance offered by rivals Alacer Gold (AQG.AU) and OceanaGold
(OGC.AU). The broker retains a neutral call with A$1.80/share price target. Regis produced 89,000
ounces of gold in the three months through September, up 35% on the previous quarter, to beat J.P.
Morgan 's forecast for 81,000 oz. "Nonetheless, we remain concerned about the history of operational
issues at Garden Well and Rosemont that have challenged our confidence in the company's assets,"
J.P. Morgan says. RRL last traded at A$1.38. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
2139 GMT [Dow Jones ] Forsyth Barr lauds Ebos Group's (EBO.NZ) strategic acquisition of BlackHawk
Premium Pet Care -- which provides a direct investment into the growing premium pet food category in
Australia. It also grows Ebos' exposure to the animal care sector, characterized by above GDP growth
and attractive margins, it says. Forsyth Barr expects the acquisition to be EPS accretive from FY15.
However, with Ebos trading at a small PE discount to the market, it retains a neutral rating and a
12-month target price of NZ$10.40. The share is +0.3% at NZ$9.60 early in New Zealand.

2136 GMT [Dow Jones ] The NZD/JPY remains well supported after the BOJ stunned markets by
announcing an increase in the pace of its assets purchases, says BNZ FX Strategist Raiko Shareef. The
pair is at 87.6475 and Shareef says BNZ is currently forecasting it will be at 0.85 by the end of the year,
however, given that BNZ will have to adjust its USD/JPY forecast as a result of Friday's news, NZD/JPY
will also be marked higher. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter : @FarroHoward)

2134 GMT [Dow Jones ] OceanaGold (OGC.AU) is in a solid position to beat its FY14 production target,
says J.P. Morgan , which also finds a lot to like in the company's revised mining plan for its Didipio
copper-gold deposit in the Philippines. OceanaGold 's strong 3Q output means it only needs to produce
24,000 troy ounces of gold in the final quarter of its fiscal year to meet the top end of its full-year
guidance of 85,000-95,000 oz. The broker also says the revised plan for Didipio means underground
mining will now start in 2017, meaning it can access ore with better grades of gold earlier. "With the
stock price well below our discounted cashflow-based valuation, and given the potential for the
development of Blackwater (which is not in our valuation), strong balance sheet and leverage to copper
prices, we remain overweight," J.P. Morgan says. OGC last traded at A$2.00, offering 53% upside to the
broker's revised A$3.05/share price target. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

price target by 10% to A$4.21/share, after the Australian homewares and electricals retailer beats its
forecast for 1Q sales. Harvey Norman reported same-store sales growth of 3.4% across its operations
from Australia to the Republic of Ireland in the three months through September, above J.P. Morgan 's
expectations for a 2.3% increase. A 23.5% rise in quarterly pre-tax profits was also ahead of the broker's
expectations. J.P. Morgan says its overweight call is underpinned by the prospect of increased sales on
the back of a robust housing market, opportunity for franchisee margin expansion and the potential for
capital management. HVN last traded at A$3.80. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
1945 GMT [Dow Jones ] Recent good U.S. news and not-so-good China news likely to weigh on
NZD/USD and "we expect to see it heading lower towards 0.7709 during the next few days," says
Westpac Bank Senior Strategist Imre Speizer. He says the October rebound appears complete at
0.8034. A break below the key 0.7709 below then targets the mid-0.70's. "The U.S. dollar remains strong
as data remains strong and Fed tightening looms. In contrast, the RBNZ will remain on hold during the
year ahead while inflation remains weak," says Speizer. The pair is at 0.7760 early in New Zealand.
