Aussie 10 year bond yields are steady at $3.909%. The $A is at 88.95US c, down about 35 from this
morning but up 15 points from last evening.

*The banks have contributed 5.9 negative points to the index, resources have contributed 0.7 negative
points, property trusts are Neutral, retailers have contributed 1 negative point and Telstra has contributed
0.9 negative points.

*The Nikkei Dow futures is up 280 points to 14,200 points, Shanghai CSI physical is closed on holiday,

The market is wavering either side of yesterday's number, with little in the way of news to push it either
way and with the high $A bringing little joy to any sector except importers. Reuters adds, "The $A was the
major currency mover after the RBA yesterday ..."shut the door on further rate cuts, citing a pick up in
housing and consumption and higher than expected inflation".

"The New Zealand dollar got its own boost when jobs data showed strong employment growth for the
fourth quarter of last year, adding to the already considerable case for a hike in interest rates...

"Currencies in emerging markets also bounced from recent lows with the Turkish lira, Brazilian real and
South African rand all gaining".

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open slightly
higher with the local futures contract up 4 points.

"There is sufficient evidence to suggest that global equities may have potentially found a few days of
respite from the selling that has taken place over the past few weeks.

"While yesterday's low will be tested at some point going forward, the weight of evidence still points to a
challenge of October's highs.

"The decline here in Oz simply remains too lethargic at present to be sinister in nature.

"But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5130. The floor will be 5090. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5112, up 14.9 points.

The S&P/ASX200 plunged 90.8 points to 5097.1 last evening.

*ACR: FDA continuing to evaluate/Axiron already carries several warnings

Acrux Ltd announced while the two recent publications published on November 5 2013 have resulted in
considerable media interest and coverage in the last 24 hours, the FDA, that has issued a Drug Safety
Communication, has been and continues to monitor this risk and will publish its recommendations once
evaluation is completed.

Lilly provides several warnings and precautions related to cardiovascular risk in product labels for Axiron.

*ANZ/IMF: Late fees constitute penalty at law, to be claimed by class action

Bentham IMF Ltd and ANZ announced Justice Gordon has delivered judgement today in the matter of
Paciocco vs ANZ Banking Group Ltd in the Victorian Registry of the Federal Court ruling that late
payment fees constitute a penalty at law and equity. Certain inter account exception fees were charged in
breach of contract and other fees paid including honour fees and dishonour fees on bank accounts, and
over limit fees on credit cards were not penalties and did not breach other statutory provisions.

IMF believes late payment fees represent approximately 25% in value of all claims brought by class action
members of ANZ. The same percentage is likely to apply to all the other major banks except for Citibank
where late fees are expected to represent over half the claim.

IMF will seek to expedite recoveries in respect of late fees from ANZ and all the other banks.
