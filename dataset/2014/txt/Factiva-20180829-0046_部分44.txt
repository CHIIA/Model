integrated more into our lives, it affects our daily actions and the way we communicate. In a rapidly
changing technological field, it is timely to consider these new relationships- to the world, technology
and each other. What does this connectedness now offer us? Experimenta Speak to Me is a dynamic
showcase of emerging and experimental artworks by leading media artists from Australia and around
the world. Visitors to Experimenta Speak to Me can expect to see a range of artworks from thoughtful
and contemplative screen-based works, to charming and elaborate installations, projections and
robots as well as a number of new Experimenta Commissions.

WANGARATTA ART GALLERY

PETITE: MINIATURE TEXTILES

UNTIL JULY 27

PETITE: Miniature Textiles is a biennial exhibition held by the Wangaratta Art Gallery that is growing
in stature and prestige. From over 200 entries, 116 works by 97 artists from across the country have
been selected for this fourth PETITE exhibition, which showcases the diversity of approach in textile
artistry. Tapestry weaving, lace, sculpture, applique, assemblage, embroidery, felting, basketry and
dyeing. These techniques are used to create works that are not only decorative but often tackle deep
and meaningful themes and concepts. The only stipulation for entrants is size which is limited to a
maximum 30cm in any direction. The beauty of the landscape and the fragile nature of our
environment provide inspiration for many of the artists such as June Brown with her textile book Why
I Love Eucalypt Trees, Deborah McArdle's sculptural work Marking Winter and Julie Paul's woven
tapestry Costal Weavings Series. The fragility of human life and remembrance has been explored in a
very poignant work by John Parkes: Sample (dead two years now) a work using cotton cloth from his
late father's shirt and shorts. An Art Lovers Talk to complement the exhibition will be presented at
10am on Wednesday, July 16 at 10am. Bookings essential " phone (03) 5722 0761.

BENALLA ART GALLERY

NEW ORDER

UNTIL AUGUST 24

Louise Paramor is one of Australia's most well recgonised and celebrated sculptors and is widely
known for her creative vision for residual and ephemeral materials. She was recipient of the
prestigious McClelland Sculpture and Survey Award in 2010 and in 2012 her monumental sculpture
"Panorama Station" was commissioned for the Peninsula Link Freeway. Paramor works with found
objects and plastics that are especially tactile and often striking in colour " characteristics that, not
surprisingly, evoke an irresistible sense of whimsy and play. This exhibition showcases a selection of
consumer-based plastic sculptural works, collage and abstract paintings on glass that challenge
traditional readings of contemporary detritus in a fun and lurid way. There is also a serious side to
Paramor's practice and the significance and indeed resonance of her artwork can be found within
religion, architecture, modern day urban life and today's heavily consumerist culture. "I really enjoy
experimenting with colour and abstraction ... and inspired by the very substance of paint itself " I have
become more interested in the principles of modernist abstract sculpture and painting, and the cliches
thereof, which in turn, informs my approach to the genre," Paramore says.

art prize. The exhibition will be a selection of short-listed works, from which the winning work will be
