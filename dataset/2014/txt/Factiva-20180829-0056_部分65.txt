The S&P/ASX200 closed up 12.9 points to 5492.8 on reasonable volume worth $3.65 billion. there were
520 issues higher and 437 down. The SPI Futures was up 23 points to 5511 on lightish volume of 16,925
contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields were up 15 points to 3.85. The $A is at 92.41 US c, down about 20
points from last evening.

*The banks contributed 10.5 positive points to the index, insurers were Neutral, resources contributed 2.1
negative points, property trusts contributed 0.4 positive points, retailers contributed 0.8 positive points,
Telstra contributed 0.9 positive points.

*Over the week our market rose 13.8 points or 0.3% to 5492.8.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was up 180 points to 14,490 points, Shanghai CSI physical had
gained 5.51 points to 2026.80, Hang Seng futures was up 26 points to 22,941 points, S&P futures was up

Spot gold was up $1 to $1295. Crude futures were up 7c to $103.81.

The Ukraine election and EU zone elections on the weekend are probably helping to establish "risk off"
trading, but why our bonds have been dumped after rising 6 points last evening is more puzzling.

Meanwhile although our market is trading 74.6% above its March 6 2009 low and only 19.6% below the all
time high of 6828.7 hit on November 1 2007, it is not a healthy bull market. "Real" bull markets are a tide
that lifts all ships. But who is to say things will not continue as they are, so long as interest rates remain
too low to attract the super fund owners, and punters run scared - while our high yield stocks remain
highly attractive to countries with decimal point returns (if that)?

"I think we will finish the week higher... up 15 on the day"
"Maree" said, "Overnight markets were not exactly buoyant, but with positive China manufacturing data
yesterday I think we will finish the week higher. I will call the market up 15 on the day".

NEWS OF THE DAY

Canaccord Genuity (Australia) Ltd chairman Warwick Grigor's "Weekly Charts & Commentary" posted
separately.
Deutsche Bank will not fund expansion of coal port near the Great Barrier Reef

Reuters reports Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, has declared it will not finance a
controversial coal port expansion in Australia near the Great Barrier Reef, responding to calls from green
groups and tourism operators.
Deutsche Bank's stand marks a win for those opposed to $26 billion worth of coal projects that plan to
use the Abbot Point port, already facing delays due to weak coal prices. But Indian firm GVK Hancock
spokesman Josh Euler said it did not impact its proposed projects in any way.

Green groups and marine operators fighting to protect the World Heritage-listed reef took their campaign
to Europe this week, urging Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and HSBC not to back the Queensland
coal projects.
They want to stop a government-approved expansion of Abbot Point that would involve dumping 3 million
cubic metres of dredged soil about 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the Great Barrier Reef, an issue that is
also of concern for UNESCO's World Heritage committee.

Campaigners against the Abbot Point expansion failed to win support from Societe Generale on Tuesday,
according to their web site, but were successful at Deutsche Bank's annual meeting on Thursday. HSBC's
annual meeting is on Friday

Lycopodium Ltd advised following its previous forecast for a reduction in demand due to the headwinds in
its sector, over the past few months reduction in demand has been more rapid and more pronounced than
expected.

previous forecast of $9.5 million, reflecting a second half loss of $2.3 million (and vs $22.5 mln last
year).

business to better align the available workload.

*MEQ: Lifts u/lying profit guidance to $NZ43/46mln vs $NZ34/38 earlier

Metlifecare Ltd advised its underlying profit guidance for the year ending June 30 is increased to a range
of $43/46 million from its previous guidance of $34/38 million.

The lift in underlying profit guidance results from stronger settlements activity at The Poynton Stage 3 and
higher capital gains and deferred membership fee income from resale activity.

Underlying profit guidance is based on Metlifecare's trading performance to April 30 and assumes a
continuation of recent trading trends for the next two months.

Development is underway at three villages on Auckland's North Shore. Stages 1 and 2 at The Orchards in
Glenfield, collectively 54 apartments and 36 hospital beds are now under construction, with considerable
interest shown in both stages.

With 14 out of a total of 25 villages in the Auckland area, Metlifecare is well positioned for growing
retirement village demand in the region.

Webster Ltd in an update at the end of harvest 2014 for both walnuts and onions said Tasmanian
orchards met targeted walnut yields.

Riverina orchards whilst ahead of the prior year did not meet internal forecasts with crop yields per
hectare below target profiles for trees in the 8th leaf whilst trees in the 5th and 7th leaf yielded above the
target profile.

Early analysis suggests this to be a temporary matter.

The commissioning of the new state of the art walnut cracking and value add facility has progressed on
time and within budgeted parameters. In-shell packing and distribution commenced in mid March, with first
orders despatched to domestic retail customers in April. Trading terms to a major Australian retailer have
been finalised, replacing imported products with Australian grown. Supply commences in June, with
volumes expected to be approximately 10% of the imported walnut volume into Australia.

Macro industry fundamentals remain strong.

Onions did not meet yield targets along with some stress on crop quality due to Northern Tasmania being
wetter and cooler than normal in the spring and beginning of summer.

Webster Ltd expects an improved profit before tax for 2014.
