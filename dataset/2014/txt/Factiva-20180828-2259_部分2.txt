The lure of Asia's growing appetite for protein and processed fare continues to deliver deals for
Australian food producers.
On Friday, the world's biggest processed meat maker, JBS SA, of Brazil, agreed to pay A$1.45 billion
($1.26 billion) for private equity-owned P&M Quality Smallgoods Pty Ltd., or Primo Smallgoods,
securing a foothold in the Asia Pacific region from which it hopes to drive exports.

Sao Paulo-based JBS will pay about 9.7 times Primo's forecast A$150 million Ebitda for the current
year. That valuation will fall to about 8 times Ebitda by 2015, according to JBS, which said it expected to
quickly boost earnings at the Australian business by about A$30 million.
Honk Kong-based Affinity Equity Partners Ltd. owns 70.1% of Primo, Australia's largest maker of ham
and bacon. It acquired the stake in 2011 in a deal that valued the operation at A$740 million. Primo's
founders, the Lederer family, own the remaining 29.9% stake and have also agreed to sell to JBS.

"This acquisition is strongly aligned with our global strategy to expand our presence in the value-added
product category and well-known brands," JBS CEO Wesley Batista said in a statement. The deal
"represents an outstanding opportunity to expand our business in Australia [and] increase exports of
convenient products."

The acquisition continues a spate of cross-border deals for Australian food and drink companies, which
are attracting interest from foreign buyers seeking production assets closer to Asia, and, in particular,
China.
Earlier this week, China's Freedom Foods Group Ltd. and Greenland Holding Group Co. announced
plans to spend hundreds of millions on Australian dairy, beef and wine companies to secure supplies
for China. In July, Wilmar International Ltd., of Singapore, and First Pacific Co., of Hong Kong, agreed
to make a A$1.32 billion bid for Australian bread and margarine maker Goodman Fielder Ltd.
Chinese imports of beef are likely to grow about 985% between 2009 and 2050, milk product imports
will climb 165%, and sheep and goat meat imports may climb over 1,800%, according to a March study
produced by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences.
The attraction of Australia as an export base for Asia increased this week after China signed off on an
agreement to remove import tariffs of as much as 20% on Australian dairy and meat from next year.

Primo, which was founded in 1985, operates a portfolio of brands, including Primo Smallgoods, Hans,
Beehive and Hunter Valley Quality Meats. It employs about 4,000 people in Australian and New
Zealand.

JBS took financial advice on the Primo acquisition from Rothschild.
