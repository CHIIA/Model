"Support is at 5390, resistance at 5475. I will call us down 25 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "With regard to the S&P 500 uptrend that began in June
2012, if you draw that trend line, it is still in tact, just.

"1800 is probably the base of that trend line. Just keep an eye on that.

"What we have seen over the last month is a bit of consolidation on the S&P. We did see a new high, but
that could not hold - the head and shoulders broke from the high of 1980 last week, which is technically
short term bearish.

"The consolidation range over the last couple of months has also broken. The 20 day moving average is
starting to trend down as well.

"The long term uptrend does remain in tact, but keep an eye on 1800.

"Nasdaq has a different set up to the S&P 500. The top was formed at the start of March. It has pretty
much been in downtrend since March 21. The confirmed downtrend has gathered a lot of acceleration with
the 20 day moving average having crossed below the 50 day moving average last week.

"The level to watch is 4,000 where it basically closed on Friday. A break would probably see it head down
to the next level of support at 3900.
"With regard to the Chinese market, a key level of support at 2000 has continued to hold. It is good to see
the Chinese market last week break 2100. It has gathered quite a bit of momentum since that break. That

Page254of259©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.market looks quite bullish with the 20 day moving average having crossed back over and above the 50 day
moving average. "2160 is resistance, support is at 2080. It is short term bullish there.
"On gold, there has been a short term break of the long term downtrend for gold, to around the $1390
level.
"Gold is in no man's land at present. It is short term neutral. There were some good movements last week
- a test of $1280 on three different days confirmed the support level there. Resistance now will be around
$1345 for gold. It is short term neutral, could go in either direction from here.

"The 20 day moving average is still in downtrend, we need to see $1325 broken .

*The XJO was interesting last week and over the last couple of weeks, de-coupling a bit from the US. after
the sell off in March there is good support at 5300. It has been in a short term uptrend from March 24. The
20 day moving average is still trending upwards along with the 50 day and will be close to testing the
uptrend, probably today.

"Support is at 5390, resistance at 5475.

"For the week keep an eye on the 5395 level where the 20 day is sitting at this moment and where we had
good support last week.

"Intra day levels are 5415 and then 5395. Resistance is probably 5435 for the day.

"Given the price action in the US and the US futures opening down 60 points this morning, I will call us
down 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 52.2 points to 5428.6 on Friday.
