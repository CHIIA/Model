Perth, Apr 28
Australian iron ore miner BC Iron has brought in a contractor to deal with an increasing overburden
problem at its Nullagine operations, a 75-25 joint venture with major Fortescue Metals Group 140km
north of Newman in the East Pilbara region.

BC Iron said the appointment of mining services companyViento Group to carry out discrete
overburden removal comes as the JV moves for the first time into deposits with increased overburden.
Commencing in the current quarter, Viento will remove about 250,000cu m of overburden from
Outcamp 3.
The company said the use of a dozer plus ripper will remove material faster and significantly more
cheaply, allowing the project’s surface miners to focus on active deposits.

The same technique or drill and blast methods are likely to be used in future years when the JV faces
the need to deal with larger overburden loads at Bonnie East and Coongan in future years.
The Nullagine JV shipped 1.22Mwmt of iron ore during the March quarter (Q3 FY14), higher than its
wet season guidance of 1.13Mwmt despite exceptionally high rainfall in January that affected load and
haul activities and in turn impacted on the short-term mine schedule.
The total mined came in below forecast at 0.95wmt, and ore from ROM stockpiles was used to
supplement mined ore as crusher feed during the worst of the weather in January.
BC Iron’s share of Q3 total shipments was 0.76Mwmt, equivalent to 62% of the total. The company
said its share would vary from quarter to quarter due to logistics planning and off-take commitments,
but would reflect its 75% JV share on an annual basis.

Sales guidance for the full year to the end of June has been retained at 5.8-6.2Mwmt.

The weather impact on production and higher waste ratios pushed FOB C1 cash costs to $A54/wmt
shipped, prompting the company to expect FY14 costs for the Nullagine JV to come in at the upper
end of its $46-50/wmt guidance. BC Iron’s cash costs guidance is lower at $40-44/wmt, due to the
prepayments of rail and port charges to Fortescue.
The average CFR price received for BC Iron’s share of the JV’s Bonnie Fines product during the
quarter fell to $US106/dmt, which translated to $102 after pricing adjustments from December quarter
shipments, and was down from the first half average of $119/dmt.
As well as the widely anticipated decline in the Platts 62% Fe North China price to $120, the achieved
sale price reflected the agreed discount offered by BC Iron for its off-take agreement with Hong
Kong-based trading company Henghou Industries plus a further small discount for two uncommitted
shipments in March.

The additional end-of-quarter discounts could be an indicator of the future, reflecting the softness in the
iron ore market despite BC Iron’s belief in continued strong demand for its Bonnie Fines.
