MARKET CLIMBS TO NEW 6 YEAR HIGH ON GOOD VOLUME

Aussie bond yields were up 1 point to 3.47%. The $A is at 93.82US c, down about 15 points on last
evening.

may cut rates next Tuesday as suggested by some leading brokers - as investors sought to pre-empt a
possible rush into shares. Banks led the way higher, but there were gains across the board.
