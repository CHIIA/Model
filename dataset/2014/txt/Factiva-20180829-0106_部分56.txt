Oil and gas players Horizon Oil and Roc Oil have struck an $800 million deal to merge their Asian
assets and make up to 20,000 barrels of oil per day. The merged company is anticipated to have assets
across Papua New Guinea, China, Myanmar, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia with a market worth
of about $800 million. Alan Linn, Roc Oil chief executive said the deal would allow Roc to operate in
attractive regions such as Malaysia and PNG following the departure of bigger companies which were
focusing on US shale assets. Linn told analysts on 29 April 2014,"There are things which need to happen
in the future in terms of finalising developments and confirming commerciality on various projects but you
have a business that has the potential to be delivering somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of
oil a day or equivalent through until about 2030. He said the goal was to make a regional operator "with
scale" as gaps in the market emerged.

Under the plan investors will trade their Horizon shares for shares in Roc Oil. Horizon stockholders will
own around 58% of the merged company, and Roc Oil stockholders the remaining 42%. Some analysts
say the deal appears to be in skewed in favour of Horizon as Roc enters in a cash position. However, Roc
chairman Mike Harding dismissed the commentary, saying the combined assets offered a good spread for
the short, long and medium term. Harding said, "If we were on our own we would continually have to look
for the next asset - we can't invest heavily in exploration.
