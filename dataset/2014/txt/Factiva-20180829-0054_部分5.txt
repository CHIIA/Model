The S&P/ASX200 closed down 27 points to 5492.5 on volume worth $6.84 billion at 4.29 pm (including
$1.5 billion assignments against options close off), rose to $6.96 billion at 4.34pm and then to $7.15
billion at 4.45 pm as a huge number of MSCI additions and deletions in their small and micro Australian
indexes (there was only one addition, one deletion in the Australia index) was a major factor (details
reported in our Morning Alert of May 15, and again in yesterday's morning alert).

There were 482 issues higher and 523 down.

*The miners led the way down, contributing 9.7 negative points to the index followed by the banks, that
contributed 6.9 negative points. Insurers contributed 0.1 positive points, property trusts contributed 1.2
negative points, retailers contributed 0.7 negative points and Telstra contributed 1.9 negative points.

Our market rose 0.2% over the week to 5492.5 and was up 0.1% over the month but still at the best
monthly close since 2009.

*At 4pm AEST the NikkeiDow futures was down 40 points to 14,650 points, Shanghai CSI physical was up
2.93 points to 2043.53, Hang Seng futures was up 88 points to 22,988 points, S&P futures was down 2.6
point to 1915.30 points, Nasdaq futures was down 3.75 points to 3731.75, Dow futures fell 15 points to
16,666 points.
Spot gold was up $2 to $1258. Crude futures were down 15c to $103.43.

*Japan's core consumer price index, which excludes fresh foods, rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier in
April to the highest level since 1991, the government said Friday, while household spending plunged as
expected following a sales tax hike.

A lack of positive news in our market - and plenty of the other kind - is weighing on investor confidence.
Iron ore prices are not expected to rebound while coal continues to fall out of favor - two cornerstones of
Australia's export earnings - mainly to China.

Over the month the Shanghai SE Comp Index also only mildly higher, up from 2,027.36 points on May 6
(was on holiday the first few days) to 2,043.53 currently.

Meanwhile the Dow rose 140 point over the month, the NikkeiDow rose just under 200 points while
European markets also rose strongly.

"I'll call it up 11 .. with the miners recovering a little bit today"

"Bernborough" said, "It is the last day of the month, but will it make a difference? Volume is very thin - of
yesterday's $3.1 billion one just doesn't know how much is due to the arbitrageurs. The miners may
stabilise or pick up some of their lost value. I'll call it up 11 on very light volume with the miners recovering
a little bit today".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 7.7 points to 5519.5 last evening.
