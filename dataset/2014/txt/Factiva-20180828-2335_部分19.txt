DEALS THE competition watchdog has cleared the way for an Asian consortium to buy Australia’s
biggest foodmaker, Goodman Fielder.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says it will not oppose the $1.3 billion
takeover by Singapore-based agribusiness Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment group
First Pacific.

The ACCC had said it was concerned the takeover could push up the price of vegetable oils in
Australia.

Goodman owns brands including Crisco and Gold’N Canola, while Wilmar supplies imported
packaged oils that supermarkets sell under their private labels.

But ACCC chairman Rod Sims said yesterday that Wilmar and Goodman Fielder would continue to
face competition from rival oil suppliers if the takeover went ahead.

“Packaged vegetable oil can be readily imported from international suppliers,” he said. “Wilmar
currently supplies oil from its offshore facilities and there are other international suppliers capable of
supplying the Australian market.” Goodman also owns brands including Helga’s bread, Praise
mayonnaise and MeadowLea margarine.
The bidders are still waiting for regulatory approval from China. A meeting of Goodman Fielder
shareholders to approve the takeover had been expected to be held in late November.But the
meeting has been pushed back to early next year as it is taking longer than expected to secure
regulatory approval from China.
