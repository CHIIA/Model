Strong overseas interest in Canberra COMMERCIAL Words by RACHEL PACKHAM

"It's not a one-hit wonder. They will be here for some time." Paul Powderly

H igh returns on capital and low interest rates are attracting large international investors to the Canberra
market. Paul Powderly, ACT chief executive of Colliers, said the company is dealing with a range of
investors, particularly from Asian countries. ï¿½China, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea are putting
an enormous amount of money into safe, balanced government locations where they get a good
return.ï¿½ He said a 3 to 3.5 per cent yield was typical for commercial investments in Asian cities,
whereas long-term government leases in Australia tend to return about 6 to 7

per cent annually. ï¿½The critical thing is that we in Australia see our market as being expensive. One of
the things that has clearly been demonstrated to me is that [international investors] believe our market is
under-priced and it's extremely attractive. Compared to Asian cities, it's well priced and attractive.ï¿½
Quality buildings coupled with reliable government tenants offered plenty of growth potential and that
was what made Canberra so appealing, he said. A number of substantial transactions were made with
international investors during the

past few years. Most recently, the Manning Clarke Offices at 186 Reid Street in Greenway, which are
leased to the Commonwealth government, were sold for $25.8 million to South African investors in May.
Previous sales include 50 Marcus Clarke Street, which sold to Singaporean investors in March, 2012 for
$225.9 million, and 10 Binara Street, which sold for $151.7 million to Middle Eastern investors in August
last year.
Mr Powderly said international interest in the commercial market in Canberra and other Australian cities
was expected to continue for a number of years and the greatest challenge will be available, quality
stock. ï¿½It's not a one-hit wonder. They will be here for some time, they will be here in strength for the
next five years buying property.ï¿½ JLL ACT's head of sales and investment, Greg Lyons, said there
are plenty of quality office buildings in Canberra but agreed that there may not be enough available to
keep up with international enquiries. ï¿½There are a lot of good quality

assets in Canberra because 40 per cent of our office stock is less than 10 years old, so there are
definitely a lot of newer buildings in Canberra but they are tightly held by current owners.ï¿½ Mr Lyons
said international investors, particularly from China, were also looking at the city's residential market.
Significant residential sites in Campbell, Lawson and Amaroo had been sold on behalf of Chinese
developers and investors in the past 12 months. ï¿½Canberra is a pretty safe market and once investors
get to understand it they feel comfortable investing in this particular market,ï¿½ he said.
