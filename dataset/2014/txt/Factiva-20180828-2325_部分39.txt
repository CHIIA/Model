2343 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Bank says Orica (ORI.AU) remains its preferred pick in the Australian
chemicals sector, despite lowering its target price after revising its foreign exchange assumptions.
Deutsche cuts Orica's price target to A$26.80/share from A$27.60, estimating a 1% move in the
Australian dollar against a basket of currencies comprising the USD, EUR, GBP and NZD could lift
pre-tax earnings by as much as A$14 million or lower it by A$10 million, depending on the direction of
exchange rates. For Orica, key risks to Deustche's buy call include mining services demand. Also in the
chemicals sector, the broker rates Nufarm (NUF.AU) as a buy with a A$4.85 price target, and Incitec
Pivot (IPL.AU) at hold with a A$3.30 price target. ORI last traded at A$18.46. (david.winning@wsj.com;

2342 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate near term after hitting a nearly two-year low
of $83.59 on Friday but settling up five cents at $85.82/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The
daily continuation chart is mixed as the five- and 15-day moving averages are declining and the MACD
indicator is bearish, but the slow stochastic measure is turning bullish in oversold territory. Resistance is
at $86.29 (Friday's high); a breach would be near-term positive, exposing the upside to $87.95
(Thursday's high), then to $88.63 (Wednesday's high), $90.57 (Tuesday's high), $90.74 (Oct. 6 high,
near the middle 20-day Bollinger Band), $91.79 (Oct. 3 high) and $92.96 (Oct. 1 high). But a drop below
the $83.59 support would reinstate the negative near-term outlook, exposing the downside to $82.10
(July 2, 2012, low), then to the psychological $80.00 line and $77.28 (June 28, 2012, swing low).
November crude is down 91 cents at $84.91/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2338 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Bank is leaning against the recent sell-off in Australian equities,
trimming positions in shares that are outperforming and adding to underperformers. "With earnings
momentum reasonable, we expect the market to rise heading into year-end." The most notable trimming,
the bank says, has been to offshore industrials where relative valuations are quite high at an about 35%
price-earnings premium to the market. It has added to its financials and energy overweight positions, but
has a small underweight position on the miners. The S&P/ASX 200 currently is down 1% at 5137.8.

2317 GMT [Dow Jones] The nickel market appears set to move into deficit in 2015, should expectations
of 4% demand growth be accurate and Indonesia's mineral ore ban remain in place, says David
Southam, executive director of Australian nickel miner Western Areas Ltd. (WSA.AU). He says the nickel
market is expected to face a deficit of 100,000 tons or so next year and for an annual shortfall to continue
for the foreseeable future. In 2013, the market was oversupplied by around 200,000 tons and is expected
to also record a surplus this year. "Stainless steel demand remains strong in China and European
stainless steel demand appears to be improving," Southam says. Meanwhile, there is a "very strong
message from the Indonesian government that the ban is permanent," he adds.

2258 GMT [Dow Jones] A 0.8% fall in New Zealand food prices in September is in line with expectations
as food prices have remained largely flat over the last year, says ASB economist Christina Leung; "The
result adds to other inflation indicators pointing to a contained inflation environment." Leung adds that the
3Q CPI release due next Thursday will show annual inflation at around 1.2%; "With little urgency for the
RBNZ to resume its tightening cycle, we continue to expect the RBNZ will keep the OCR (official cash
rate) on hold at 3.5% until March 2015." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

house sales due to election-related uncertainty, says Westpac Bank. Recent data from REINZ have been
weak, "hinting at a renewed slowdown in housing" but "it is not clear whether this was signal or noise,"
says Westpac. House sales fell 19% between September and April, and rose 4% between April and
August. While they may be weaker in September, Westpac says a rebound in October is possible. The
data are due early this week. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)
2244 GMT [Dow Jones] Base metals companyRed River Resources (RVR.AU) will likely need around
A$15 million to restart production at the Thalanga mine in Australia's Queensland state by the end of
2015, and a further A$10 million for exploration, says Foster Stockbroking. The broker rates Red River a
speculative buy, with a A$0.58/share price target. Red River says the West 45 area, which management
acquired from Kagara Mining after it became insolvent, is the logical place to resume output. Foster,
which visited the Thalanga site recently, said Red River has several advantages over other junior
miners. These include nearby infrastructure including roads, port, refinery, and grid power; workforce
access at Charters Towers and Townsville; an existing mill; and an advanced developed ore body close
by. RVR last traded at A$0.245. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
2241 GMT - Bell Potter remains positive about Australia's big general insurers. It defends buy
recommendations for Insurance Australia Group (IAG.AU), QBE Insurance (QBE.AU) and Suncorp
(SUN.AU) based on the defensive nature of the industry and operating scale of the three companies,
which are working to cut costs. It also says SUN has a large and likely growing capital surplus, while the
upside is likely greatest for QBE given its investments are shorter in duration and its claims liabilities
longer in duration. It has a target of A$6.75/share on IAG, A$13.10/share on QBE and A$15/share on
SUN. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
2233 GMT [Dow Jones] AME Group thinks the Chinese nickel pig iron, or NPI, industry will contract
over the next six months as nickel ore supplies finally start to tighten following Indonesia's raw mineral
export ban. AME nickel industry manager Dirk Treasure says he expects "significant declines in Chinese
NPI output," forecasting production to fall to 330,000 tons from 430,000 tons in 2014, and decline again
in 2015. "We are starting to see these facilities closing down," he says, although points out closures are
largely among the industry's smaller producers. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

2223 GMT - Highfield Resources (HFR.AU), which is developing a potash project in northern Spain,
offers 53% upside for investors betting that emerging economies such as Brazil and China will need
more fertilizer to sustain their food production, says Bell Potter. The broker has a buy call and A$0.90
price target on the stock. It says the ASX-listed company has enough cash to complete a feasibility
study into its Muga-Vipasca project around mid-2015, but will likely need to raise around A$110 million
thereafter to fund the equity component of its development. Bell Potter also adopts a more conservative
price outlook on long-term potash prices of US$300/ton, compared with Highfield's estimate of around
US$400/ton. HFR last traded at A$0.585. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2218 GMT - Australian shares are likely to continue last week's slide, with no sign worries over the pace
of global growth are letting up. U.S. stocks capped a volatile week with losses Friday, and the Dow
industrials shifted back into negative territory for the year. IG forecasts an opening fall of 1.1% for the
S&P/ASX 200 to about 5127. Trade balance data due Monday out of China will be watched closely given
concerns over a slowdown in Australia's biggest trading partner have been one of the triggers for the
sharp and sustained selling in Aussie shares, IG market strategist Evan Lucas says. BHP Billiton
(BHP.AU) shares may weaken after the U.S. ADRs fell 1.1%, although the spot iron-ore price rose 0.5%
on Friday to US$79.90/ton, IG figures show. The ASX 200 ended Friday down 2.1% at 5188.3.

2209 GMT - If investor lending in Australia loses more steam then it would relieve a key constraint to
easier monetary policy, says J.P. Morgan. "The fact that further macro-prudential measures are expected
to be announced by year-end adds to this prospect," J.P. Morgan economist Ben Jarman says. The
value of loans for investment housing in Australia fell 0.1% in August from a month earlier, slowing
sharply from a 5.6% on-month rise in July, data showed Friday. "Of course, it's still possible that foreign
investment activity keeps prices going up," Mr. Jarman says, noting that Sydney is a potential hotspot.
That would leave the Reserve Bank of Australia with the existential question of whether it should care
about rising asset prices if there is no marginal leverage associated with it. "We suspect officials would
view such a situation as outside the purview of monetary policy," Mr. Jarman says.
