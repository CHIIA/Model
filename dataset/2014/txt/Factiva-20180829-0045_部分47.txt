ICON Energy this week played host to its Chinese partners who visited to sign an extension of their
20-year gas supply deal.
Icon has agreed to supply Shantou SinoEnergy with 40 million tonnes of LNG over 20 years.

The extension of the gas sale agreement to June 30, 2015 comes just over a week after an
independent report found the Gold Coast-based explorer is sitting on a significant gas resource in the
Cooper Basin.

The report by US consultancy DeGolyer McNaughton found Icon’s ATP855 tenement in the Napamerri
Trough had a best-estimate resource of at least 28 trillion cubic feet and a high estimate of 37.74 Tcf.
Icon holds a 35.1 per cent stake in the tenement, with partners Beach Energy holding 46.9 per cent
and Chevron Australia 18 per cent.
Icon yesterday said its Chinese deal was contingent on it proving up P2 (proven and probable)
reserves of LNG by June 30, 2015 and on Shantou SinoEnergy obtaining an import licence from the
Chinese Government and building a receiving facility by the same date. Shareholders approved,
sending Icon shares up 3.85 per cent to close at 13.5¢ .
Icon’s contract with the Chinese Government-backed Shantou SinoEnergy, signed in 2011, is worth
up to $30 billion and calls for LNG delivery to start in late 2016.
At the time of signing, the company said it was confident of securing gas from its own reserves,
particularly ATP 855, which, it said, was “highly prospective’’.
Managing director Ray James said yesterday the independent report had confirmed the company was
sitting on a valuable asset.

He said with demand for LNG in the Asia Pacific region set to jump from 175Mtpa in 2013 to 325Mtpa
in 2025 Icon was well placed to meet some of this demand.

“To have a 28Tcf recoverable prospective resource booking with Icon’s interest being 10Tcf is a
significant step towards our primary objective of proving up 2Tcf of 2P reserves in ATP855,” he said.

Mr James said the joint venture had completed drilling the sixth and final well in its initial drilling
program.This will be followed by hydraulic stimulation and extended testing of four wells which is
expected to begin this month.
