The S&P/ASX200 is up 18.4 points to 5343.3 at midday on light volume worth $1.2 billion. There are 431
issues higher and 359 down. The SPI Futures is up 3 points to 5307 on light volume of 5946 contracts.

*The banks have contributed 10 positive points to the index, resources contributed 8.9 negative points,
property trusts contributed 0.7 positive points, retailers contributed 3.3 positive points and Telstra
contributed 0.5 positive points.

*The Nikkei Dow futures is down 90 points to 15,879, Shanghai CSI physical is down 12.22 points to
2033.49, Hang Seng futures is down 63 points to 22,615 points, S&P futures is up 1 point to 1822, Nasdaq

*Reuters reports the Indian government is mulling easing the import duty on gold, with a decision likely to
be taken this month.
India imposed the curbs last year when overseas gold purchases - the country's second most expensive
import after oil - pushed its current account deficit to a record and undermined the rupee currency.
With three duty hikes last year to a record 10 percent and onerous restrictions tying purchases to exports,
official arrivals shrank almost 90 percent in the six months to November, helping China displace India as
the world's top gold buyer.

Our market has regained much of yesterday's loss at midday with Asian markets generally higher, but
trade is quiet and there are few highlights so far.

"Near term support at 5300, resistance at 5335. I will call it down 5 points"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P 500 again had a slight pull back last night. The
uptrend remains in tact and it is still trading above the 20 day moving average but is coming close to
testing it, which now sits at 1817. A break of that level would be short term bearish. Support is likely at
1800. It's worth keeping an eye on 1817.

"The Shanghai market has failed again in its test of the resistance level of 2250 and broke down right back
to 2100, which was proving good support, as it did in Oct/Nov last year. That has now broken down also.
The chart there is short and medium term bearish. With 2050 broken yesterday it looks set to test support
at 2000 even. A break of 2000 even will test the lows of last year at 1950.
"Gold is in a short, medium and long term downtrend. It has had a bit of a short covering bounce as it did
a couple of times last year but the downtrend is still on track. The 20 day moving average is at $2019,
which will likely be short term support. Resistance is at $1250. There is no confirmation of a short term
break out ahead until we see a weekly close above $1260. It's a bit of a dead cat bounce for gold at
present.

Page258of276©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The XJO after consolidating lat week rolled over negatively yesterday. We broke the two levels of
support. There is still plenty of room to pull back to the 20 day moving average at 5225. The RSI looks as
if it is losing momentum as well.

"Support now is at 5300 even. A break of 5300 will probably see us head down to 5250 and 5225 over the
coming week.

"Intra day support is at 5300. The next level is 5285. Resistance now for the day is at 5335. The next level
of resistance is 5345.

"For the day, after quite a decent sell off yesterday, I will call the market down 5 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 25.2 points to 5324.9 last evening.

In addition the parties have agreed that GPT Funds Management will also have the opportunity to acquire
a further two CPA assets, a 100% interest in 655 Collins Street Melbourne and a 50% interest in 10
Shelley Street Sydney. The aggregate value ascribed to these CPA assets is 4679 million with GWOF
having the ability to acquire all or any of the assets. The CPA assets are offered for sale on an 'as is,
where is' basis.

The MOU will include a call option in favor of GWOF and a put option in favor of the Consortium over each
of the CPA assets. Terms of exercise were laid out.

GPT, GWOF enter into binding MOU with the Consortium
The GPT Group announced that GWOF and GWSCF have entered into binding memoranda of
understanding with the Consortium and with CPPIB in relation to the acquisition of the CPA assets

*BDR: Record gold production, cash and bullion for December qtr
Beadell Resources Ltd announced record gold production at the Tucano gold mine in Brazil of 60,823
ozs, up 10.4% on the September quarter, reflecting the continued contribution of high grade ore from
Duckhead. Gold recovered totalled 60,823 ozs and gold recovery was at 92%.
Gold recovered for the second half of 2013 was down 3.4% on guidance of 120,000 ozs to 116,000 ozs.
Total gold ore, waste and iron ore mined for the December quarter was4.7 million tonnes compared to a
forecast of 6.9 million tonnes (down 32%). This along with a slightly earlier onset of the wet season was
the main contributor to the lower than forecast gold production.

C1 cash costs excluding the 1% royalty are yet to be finalised, but are expected to be close to the upper
limit of the guidance range of $US435/485 per oz for the second half of 2013. Iron ore credits will
positively impact on these cash costs.
Cash and bullion as at Decemebr 31 totalled $25 million.
Gold sales for the quarter were a record 64,131 ozs vs 43,529 ozs in the September quarter following the
successful upgrade of the gold elution circuit completed in the previous quarter.
Managing director Peter Bowler said the company looks forward to continued contribution over coming
quarters from Duckhead.

Full details will be released on or about January 23.

pre-seeding of the LAMP was produced and returned by the end of the quarter.

Despite significant rainfall in early December causing flooding and restricted access in and around the
Kuantan city area, the Gebeng Industrial Estate in which the LAMP is situated was not directly affected by
flooding.
Also in December, a Lynas Malaysia employee suffered a fatal heart attack while on site. The company

Paradigm Metals Ltd announced the company has completed a six hole RC drill program at three
prospects for a total of 816m at its 100% owned Ladies project, 70 km west of Cloncurry.
At Lady Kate three holes were drilled with high grade copper mineralisation (up to 2m at 11% Cu and
1.85gpt Au as oxide) was intersected in two holes at down hole depths of 20 to 40 m.
At Lady Rose two holes were drilled to 180m. One hole intersected sulphide as chalcopyrite copper
mineralisation together with significant quantities of magnetite.

At Lady Amy one hole was drilled to 114m, no significant mineralisation was intersected.
In future work the company intends to more thoroughly evaluate the deeper magnetic zones away from
the superficial copper oxide mineralisation.

*RMX: Up to 45.9gpt Au in Lobo prospect, Batangas project, Philippines
Red Mountain Mining Ltd announced it has made another exceptionally high grade gold discovery on the
500m long South West Breccia Lode structure at its Lobo Prospect, Batangas Gold project in the
Philippines. The peak new intersection (Trench 13) of 2.6m at 28.6gpt Au including 1.5m at 45.9gpt Au is
located 100m along strike to the southwest of the previously announced high grade Trench 7 intersection
of 2m at 31.1gpt Au including 1m at 60.2gpt Au, announced on November 6 2013.

Recent sampling on the other northeast wall of Trench 7 produced an intersection of 3m at 22.2 gpt Au
including 1m at 41.5gpt Au.
Managing director Jon Dugdale said the company's cost effective surface trenching program will continue
to define lode continuity at surface before drilling is planned to define potential high grade gold mineral
resources.

He said in the report, "It is likely that a pinching and swelling epithermal lode is intermittently developed
over the entire strike length from South West Breccia through Japanese Tunnel, the Trench 7 ar4ea and to
the Trench 13 area with each "swell" representing a potential individual high grade gold shoot spaced
approximately 100m apart within the 500m long lode corridor mapped to date. The logical next stage of
exploration is to drill under the high grade trenches".
