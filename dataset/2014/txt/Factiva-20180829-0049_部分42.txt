The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close a touch higher today.

Markets were higher in Europe, the UK and US.

On the NYSE where 3231 issues traded there were 1,931 issues higher, 1,190 down and 110 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2762 issues traded there were 1,810 issues higher, 847 down and 105 unchanged.
Metals were higher, crude fell a touch, gold was down a touch. The $A is at 93.39US c, down about 15
points from last evening.

"May get back what it lost yesterday, up about 10"

"Maree" said, "With the RBA likely to keep rates low for a long time, there may be incentive for investors to
get back into stocks. I expect the market may get back what it lost yesterday, up about 10 points on the
day. But there is no real momentum driving the market either way.

"The $A came under a little bit of pressure after the RBA minutes on a bit of unwinding while investors
flocked into the kiwi instead - which has gained about 3c vs the $A over the last week.

"However so long as the yield differential between ourselves and the likes of the US, ECB and Japan
continues, we will continue to attract overseas funds until such time as our economy is perceived to have
weakened further".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 11.6 points to 5400.7 last evening.
