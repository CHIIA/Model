A million dollars doesn’t buy as much these days — now you need at least $2 million for that dream
house ONCE you could buy a prestige home on a million dollar budget. Now, two million is the new
one million, according to RP Data spokesman Robert Larocca.
“The luxury or prestige segment is better defined by sales over $2 million and the old measure of $1
million covered nine per cent of all sales,” Mr Larocca said.

Middle and bayside suburbs further from the city have started to see $2 million-plus sales, joining the
likes of Brighton and Toorak.
“All streets in a suburb are not equal and houses with water views or park frontages can command
prices way above a suburb’s median price,” Mr Larocca said. “There are choice streets in many
suburbs where buyers are prepared to pay a premium to live there.” RP Data figures show Brighton led
the way with 128 sales of homes for $2 million-plus in the 12 months to January. It was followed by
Toorak with 105 sales and Kew with 82. In all there were 1298 sales above the $2 million mark across
Melbourne.
JP Dixon director Jonathan Dixon said sales of $2 million-plus homes in Brighton took hold two years
ago and were now common.
Mr Dixon said it took about $10 million to make a real splash in Brighton these days, with his agency
handling four sales of $10 million homes over a recent six-week period.
“The buyers of $2 million properties are mainly professionals and from overseas and include locals
and outsiders and expats. The overseas buyers mainly come from China and also America, UK and
South Africa,” Mr Dixon said.
Further down the bay in Aspendale, sales of $2 million homes have created a buzz with five sales
over a year, including a $2.9 million purchase to a Chinese buyer.
And a beachfront mansion on the Nepean Highway is on the market with a $5 million-plus price tag.

Figures from RP Data also show a rise in prestige high-rise apartments sales in areas such as
Docklands, where 12 such sales were recorded in the year to January. The median unit value in the
area is just under $570,000.

“These apartments offer great views and the higher you go, the more you pay,” Mr Larocca said.
Prestige home sales of $2 million or more make up about 1.5 per cent of all sales in the Melbourne
market.

But the numbers have jumped around over the past few years. There were 1436 sales in the year to
November 2010. This fell to 1046 for the same period in 2012, then bounced up to 1161 in 2013.

They subdivided the corner block, sold one lot and built their dream home on the sloping site.

Close to a private school for their three kids, the large luxury home includes an indoor pool and spa,
five bedrooms, a wine cellar and a four-car garage.
While a $2 million price tag was unimaginable a decade ago, Ms Ellershaw said she noticed several
nearby homes selling in this range before listing their home with LJ Hooker.
They received three offers of $2 million-plus before selling for $2.15 million in March.

According to Ken Chen, from LJ Hooker in Glen Waverley, the secret to his success was hard work
and reaping the benefit of networking and connections though the company’s office in China.
