State Member for Murray Valley Tim McCurdy has been accused of forging the letterhead of a Cobram
real estate agent to claim hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales commissions.

As reported in the Herald Sun, the former real estate agent and current Nationals MP is being sued for
$375 741 from the sale of two farms to Chinese investors in 2009.

In a writ lodged with the County Court at Shepparton, PGW Agriservices (formerly PGG Wrightson real
estate) has accused Mr McCurdy of ‘‘engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct’’ and
unconscionable conduct contravening the Fair Trading Act.
The statement of claim seen by the Cobram Courier alleges a 581 ha dairy property on O’Dwyer Rd,
Boosey, was sold to overseas buyer Xing Long in July 2009.
The property, known as Malmo, was sold for about $7.8 million, including a commission of $245 850.
A second property in Katamatite, known as Pinegrove, sold for $3.9 million to the same buyer in
December that year with a $129 891 commission.
The writ claims Mr McCurdy was not entitled to complete either sale or claim the commission as he no
longer worked for the real estate company that had initially negotiated the deals.

The writ claims Mr McCurdy was paid $70 000 a year plus $900 a month vehicle allowance as part of
the employment agreement with the real estate company.

It also alleged he used documents from his former employer and broke an agreement not to carry on a
real estate business within 100 km of a Cobram business he had sold to the plaintiff.
Mr McCurdy worked for PGG Wrightson from June 2008 until February 2009, when the company sold
the Australian real estate side of its business to another Cobram agent Andrew Gilmour.
The company alleges that before Mr McCurdy left he told Mr Gilmour the sales of Malmo and
Pinegrove had ‘‘fallen over’’ and ‘‘were not proceeding due to the lack of finance’’.

In particular, the writ alleges Mr McCurdy created and used the letterheads ‘Gilmour & Co’ and
‘Andrew Gilmour Real Estate’ which included Mr McCurdy’s own name and personal mobile number.

The writ claims a letter in June 2009 was sent to Mr McCurdy saying ‘‘you are not, and never have
been, an employee of Gilmour & Co’’.

PGW Agriservices claims to be entitled to 3.3 per cent commission from the sales, or $375 741 in total,
plus interest for the five years since the properties’ sale.

Nationals spokesman Les White has denied any wrongdoing on Mr McCurdy’s behalf.

establish if the case proceeds,’’ Mr White said.
