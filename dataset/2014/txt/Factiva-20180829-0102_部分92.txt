THE Woree drive-in cinema site is on the market for $24 million, almost eight times what it sold for at
$3.3 million in 2011.

But the developers say the campaign is “a marketing tool” to attract an institutional investor or other
parties into a joint venture of a staged $175 million, 503-unit residential and commercial project.

Far Northern tourism heavyweight Ken Chapman, movie, entertainment and leisure figure Hans
Eberstaller (the managing director of AHL Strategic Investments) and Cairns man Premjit Singh are
directors of Sunset Driveinn Pty Ltd, which owns the Bruce Highway site and is behind the development.
The 5.5ha property has been listed by WCB Global Real Estate in Sydney with licensee Geoffrey Hill
telling The Cairns Post the owners were testing the market. “They are looking for a response, some
feedback,’’ he said.
Mr Hill said the company was considering options for the land which could include venture capital
investment.
He said the project was being marketed in Australia with China and Asia also being targeted.

Mr Hill said pending developments in Cairns had sparked the move. “It (the $8.15 billion Aquis mega
resort) has made the sale a lot stronger,’’ he said.

Mr Hill said the city was poised for development, particularly because of its proximity to Asia and there
was a need for new units in the city.
He said the property had just been placed on realestate.com.au and it was too early for any responses.
Developer Jason Guarerra said the site was not for sale but was being marketed in this way to try to
attract investors.
He said the project was still going ahead with site levelling, roads, and underground services completed.

Urban Development Institute of Australia Far Northern chairman Adam Gowlett said it appeared that the
sale was a marketing testing exercise.

He said considering what was proposed, the price of $24 million which was about $50,000 for each “raw”
unit site, was fair.
The property has council approval for the 503 units, which include 400 two-bedroom apartments, two
3500sq m commercial sites and 780 car spaces.

It will house more than 1000 people and be built in four stages of about 130 units each over four years.
The property was the largest in the Glenwood Homes/Glencorp property portfolio sold by receivers and
managers in December 2011.Former builder-developer Udo Jattke also had plans for a 520-unit
residential development on the site.
