Twiggy’s beef buy WESTERN Australia’s Harvey Beef processor was bought by mining billionaire
Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest last week. The $30 million sale by Singapore’s Harmony Group puts the
company, the only processor accredited to export to China, back into Australian hands.

Price rise THE Weekly Times’ cover price will rise to $2.20 next week.

Libs endorse lawyer LAWYER Aaron Lane has won the No. 2 spot on Liberal Party ticket for the
Western Victorian Region. Mr Lane, a research fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs, replaces David
Koch, who will retire after 12 years in Victorian Upper House. MP Simon Ramsay holds the No. 1 spot
on the ticket.
Fresh milk to ChinaTHE first commercial shipment of fresh Australian milk will hit Chinese stores soon
from northern NSW dairy co-operative, Norco. It follows 18 months of discussions between Norco,
lobby group Dairy Connect, Chinese officials and food exporter Peloris Global Sourcing. It now takes
just seven days to land fresh milk in China, rather than 14-21 days. Queensland Dairyfarmers’
Organisation president Brian Tessmann said this was a message for Australian supermarkets that they
could not take local fresh milk supply for granted.
