Metro Property Group has struck a deal to buy the wealthy Power family's Central Brunswick retail
property in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, for about $35 million.

The deal, which includes a long-dated settlement time, could see James Power, famed for
Personalised Plates Queensland, make a $15 million profit in just over two years.

The deal also reveals just how heated the appetite for development sites in Brisbane is at the
moment.
Mr Power purchased the property through Central Brunswick Holdings from former hairdresser
Anthony Barakat in 2012. The new deal with Metro, owned by David Devine, Ken Woodley and Luke
Hartman, comes after the company only just finalised its own sensational deal to sell a property to
a Chinese company for a $24 million profit.
Chinese-based R & F Group exchanged contracts to buy Metro's TAFE site in South Brisbane for
about $46 million. Metro purchased the property just a year ago for $22 million from the Newman
government.
Metro's purchase of Brunswick Central was brokered by Ray White Transact's Rick Bird, who
declined to comment. It is believed Metro would like to construct two towers of about 600 units and
up to 6000 square metres of retail.
Metro chief executive Luke Hartman would not comment on the deal but said the company's pipeline
had been building up, with 5000 apartments planned.
Metro paid about $25 million last week for a 1.56-hectare site at 66-98 Montpelier Road, Bowen
Hills, Queensland, where it plans to build 550 apartments in four or five eight-level towers.

Late last year it snapped up a portfolio of six sites from the Uniting Church Australia for about
$25 million.
