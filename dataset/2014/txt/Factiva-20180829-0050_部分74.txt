*Bloomberg reports The World Bank cut its global growth forecast amid weaker outlooks for the US,
Russia and China, while calling on emerging markets to strengthen their economies before the Federal
Reserve raises interest rates.

The World Bank predicts the world economy will expand 2.8% this year, compared with a January
projection of 3.2%. The US forecast was reduced to 2.1% from 2.8% while outlooks for Brazil, Russia,
India and China were also lowered. The setbacks may be temporary: the 2015 estimate for world
economic growth was unchanged at 3.4%.

Although Reuters reports a newly resurgent carry trade in Europe (buying the Euro at negligible cost to
seek higher returns in other currencies) Australia does not seem to be the main focus, given the
weakness in our bonds. The main focus in our market was on stock specific news, but turnover was light.

"Ceiling will be 5500. Floor will be 5431 ... close at 5462 points, down 7.7"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open relatively
flat with the local futures contract up 1 point.

"In terms of the bigger picture, I remain steadfast in my view that it is late in the ball game for investors.

"Index leadership is bearish both here and in the US. Sector leadership is largely bearish as well. And you
are now seeing Extreme Greed in the US as per CNN Moneys Fear and Greed index.

"Now I still have one more rally high pencilled in for our market in the short to medium term, I am just not
sure of the exact timing or level at present.

"But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5500. The floor will be 5431. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5462, down 7.7 points'.

ECO NEWS

*The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index gained 0.2% to 93.2, after falling 6.8% in
May.

Consumer sentiment is still down 8.8% over the past 12 months.

The doom and gloom surround the Coalition government's first federal budget is still weighing heavily on
consumers' minds, with sentiment surrounding family finances versus a year ago down 5.4% from last
month. However, households remain optimistic about the next 12 months with a 5% improvement in
sentiment surrounding finances in the next year.

''The index is still in firmly pessimistic territory however, down 6.6% from its pre-Budget level in April and
15.6% below its post-election high in November last year," Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan
said.

Following last year's budget, there was a similar plunge in the consumer sentiment index, which fell 7% in
May. But, this was followed by a 4.7% recovery in June.

*The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) has lowered its
forecast for 2014/15 wheat production by nearly 1 percent on Wednesday as dry weather curbs yields,
and warned output could fall further if an El Nino weather pattern forms. The world's third-largest wheat
exporter is expected to produce 24.59 million tonnes in the current season, down from a March estimate
of 24.80 million tonnes, the country's official agricultural forecaster said.
The crop would still be the seventh-largest on record following last year's bumper 27.01 million tonnes,
but) cautioned that dry weather could cut yields.

"Sufficient and timely rainfall over winter will be critical to the development of winter crops, particularly in
those areas where soil moisture levels are presently low," the bureau said.

"Yields are likely to be lower than currently assumed if sufficient and timely rainfall is not received."

The forecast decline in the wheat crop comes even as the acreage devoted to the grain is expected to rise
to a three-year high of 13.84 million hectares.

ABARES cautioned that the impact of an El Nino, seen by most global forecasters as increasingly likely to
arrive over the next few months, would be difficult to predict.

NEWS OF THE DAY

IEA ponders supply/demand for LNG
Reuters reported the International Energy Agency expects natural gas demand growth in the next five
years to be led by Asia, with the region consuming an additional 250 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2019.
This will be led by China, where demand is expected to double to 315 bcm.
While increased domestic output and pipeline from Russia and central Asia will bolster Chinese supplies,
the IEA still expects LNG to make a significant contribution.

About 100 bcm of additional LNG demand will come from Asia in the next five years, a gain equivalent to
about a third of the total LNG market of 322 bcm in 2013.

The 100 bcm of additional LNG required can be mostly met from the plants that are already under
construction.
Australia's seven LNG projects currently being built will deliver 61.8 million tonnes per annum, equivalent
to about 84 bcm, while Cheniere's Sabine Pass, the only U.S. project being built, will add 24.4 bcm.

Other new projects in Russia and Africa will ensure that the LNG market will at worst be balanced and
most likely will have a small surplus in the next five years.

However, the IEA points out in its report, LNG demand won't suddenly stop growing in 2020, and given
the lead time of at least five years, projects will have to get approval soon in order to start up from 2020
onwards.

Since the wave of approvals in Australia for current plants, there has been a dearth of new final
investment decisions, with the IEA pointing only to Yamal LNG in Russia.

Australian LNG producers have been arguing in recent months that the country will miss out on the next
round of approvals unless costs can be cut.

Even if labour and regulatory costs do come down, it's still questionable as to whether greenfield LNG
projects can get a green light, and not just in Australia.
The $400 billion deal between Russia and China to supply 38 bcm of natural gas a year has been widely
interpreted as setting a new benchmark for what the Asian market can pay for gas.
Although the price wasn't disclosed, sources have put it at around $10 per million British thermal units
(mmBtu), close to what Russia receives for supplies sent to Europe.

However, this is well below the LNG price in Asia, with spot currently at $13.10 per mmBtu, a level likely
close to the seasonal low. The peak so far in 2014 was $20.50 and an average of around $16-$17 for the
year seems likely.
If LNG buyers insist on prices more closely aligned to the Russia-China deal, or to U.S. Henry Hub, they
may well be successful in driving costs down as producers compete to sell spot cargoes.

However, any success in lowering LNG costs will merely ensure that new projects don't get built, as a
delivered to China price closer to $10 per mmBtu would likely render even the planned plants in the
United States uneconomic, despite the lower cost of their shale gas feedstock.

While all LNG buyers say they want lower prices, it may turn out that in the longer term the smart buyers
are those that are still prepared to pay more for secure multi-year contracts, especially for deliveries after
2020.

*DOW: BMA terminates Goonyella contract early/entitled to compensation

Downer EDI Ltd announced it was informed last night that its overburden removal contract at the
Goonyella Riverside mine in Queensland had been terminated by BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA)
with effect from September 9 2014. Downer currently employs 427 people at the operation in four pre strip
fleets.

Downer estimates that the early termination of the contract which was due to be completed in June 2016
will have an impact on work in hand of approximately $360 million ($160 million in the 2015 financial
year and $200 million in the 2016 financial year).

Under the terms of the contract Downer will be entitled to compensation for early termination.

*FLT: Expects record u/lying NPAT, but at the low end of previous forecast
Flight Centre Ltd announced the company expects to achieve a record underlying profit before tax in the
order of $370/380 million for the year to June 30 2014, a result at the low to mid point of current market
guidance. Managing director Graham Turner said the expected result represents 8/11% growth on
2012/13.
He said the group remains comfortable with its overall guidance - specifically it aims to deliver an
underlying PBT between $370/385 million.
He said the group's ability to hit the top of its targeted range has been adversely affected by disappointing
leisure travel results in Canada and a tougher trading environment for the large Australian leisure
business during the past eight weeks. While Australian leisure continues to grow and increase market
share, it is not achieving the high levels of growth during the 4th quarter as it recorded earlier in the year.

This slowdown in growth was most evident in May. While demand often rebounds quickly after a short
term downturn, conditions are uncertain, the MD said.

*TRY: Casposo rockfall, maint to reduce Jun qtr prod/Andorinhas extended
Troy Resources Ltd advised at the Casposo gold and silver mine in Argentina, a series of rockfalls have
occurred in one of the high grade stopes within the INCA 1 zone. There has been no injury to employees
or damage to equipment. The area impacted is directly above level 9 and 10, the highest grade levels
within the INCA 1 zone. A clay rich zone approximately 2m into the hanging wall seems to have caused
weakness that resulted in dilution of ore with waste, lowering the grade drawn from the stopes and
delaying mining of the very high grade level 9.

With the help of a specialist external rock mechanics expert, Troy is reviewing the mine plan to minimise
the risk of such an incident reoccurring in the very high grade zones. It is too early to determine whether
this will impact production guidance for full year 2015.

Separately an inspection of mill liners has resulted in a decision to bring forward into June a 6 day
maintenance shut that had been scheduled for early July. This will result in June quarter production being
lower than planned at around 27,000 ozs gold equivalent. At Andorinhas, the company has received the
Environmental Permit to mine the Coruja open pit deposit within the Mamao permit at the Andorinhas
mine in Para State Brazil.
This will ensure that sufficient high grade ore tonnes will now be delivered to the processing plant. Without
Coruja, Andorinhas would have closed early in the second half of calendar 2014. The approval means the
operation will continue through to end 2015 and is expected to produce 27,000/30,000 ozs in 2015.
