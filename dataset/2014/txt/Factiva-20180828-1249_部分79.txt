Chinese property group Aqualand Australia has paid Parramatta Council more than $120 million
for a 4.85-hectare development site, the highest price for residential land outside the CBD this
year.
The Shanghai-based developer beat local groups including Meriton for the site at 657-661 Victoria
Road and 4-6 Wharf Road Melrose Park, in Sydney's north-west.

While Aqualand has already bought three sites in Australia the Melrose Park buy is the biggest.
The site has been re-zoned allowing for mixed-use development and up to 97,000 square metres
of residential apartments, which could yield up to 1200 units.
Located 17 kilometres north-west of the Sydney CBD, Melrose Park is approximately 2 kilometres
west of the main shopping centre hub of West Ryde. It is also emerging as one of the
fastest-growing residential suburbs in the city.

It sits on the northern bank of the Parramatta River, offering waterfront views, as well as excellent
access to the greater Sydney community by road, rail or ferry.

Colliers agents Guillaume Volz and Harry Bui negotiated the deal but declined to comment.

Sydney suburbs have been a powerful lure for investors this year, as many CBD and fringe assets
are tightly held.

Buyers are looking further afield for opportunities.
Developer Crown Group and China-based Starryland have been early entrants to the Parramatta
market.
Most recently a syndicate led by Rebel Property Group and finance group Ashe Morgan
purchased an office tower with redevelopment potential in Burwood for $35.6 million,
