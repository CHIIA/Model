Goodman Group has sold a Kmart distribution centre in Melbourne's western fringe to global funds
giant Invesco Real Estate for a price in the mid-$90 million range, as the group continues to
expand its presence in Australia.
It is understood the sale reflected a yield in the 6 per cent range although Goodman Group
declined to comment on the transaction and Invesco could not be reached for comment.

Selling agents Tony Iuliano of Colliers International and Michael Fenton and Matt Lee of JLL also
declined to comment.
It is the third major sale for Goodman in the last month, with the industrial group selling more than
$580 million worth of assets.
Last week, China Poly Group bought the 8,314 square metre Cambridge Office Park in Sydney's
Epping for $110 million from Goodman, the state-owned group's first ever acquisition in Australia.
The site has potential for about 500 apartments and is vacant as of next year. JLL's Sam Brewer
and Ben Hunter brokered the deal.
Earlier in November, in one of the biggest residential single site deals in Australia's history, Hong
Kong's Golden Horse bought the Ashmore Estate in Sydney's Erskineville for $380 million.
The Kmart property in Truganina is understood to be one of Invesco's first high-end industrial
purchases.

The 76,938 square metre centre at 2-12 Banfield  Court is 100 per cent leased until 2026 with fixed
rental increases of 3 per cent.
The facility was built in 2011 and sits on a 14.6 hectare site close to the Princes Freeway.

Invesco, a global fund manager that acts for many international investors, has been busy bolstering
its property holdings this year, particularly prime office buildings.

In August, it bought a Melbourne office tower on Exhibition Street for $208 million from Cromwell
Property Group. Last year, it advised China's sovereign wealth fund, Chinese Investment
Corporation on its near $300 million purchase of the Centennial Plaza complex in Sydney.
