NSW Development site sale, Victoria Road and Wharf Road, Melrose Park, Sydney Chinese group
Aqualand has bought a major residential site in Sydney’s northwest for $130 million. The Lord Mayor
of Parramatta, John Chedid, said the 4.8ha property was the biggest development site sale in
western Sydney for the year.
“This is a great win for our community,” he said. “The site is a key eastern gateway to Parramatta
near excellent public transport links and the Parramatta riverfront with Sydney-wide views. For many
years, this site has been under-utilised and surplus to community needs. The sale provides a
financial windfall sought-after location.” The site could sustain more than 1000 apartments.
