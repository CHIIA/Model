(Chart)

Interpretation:

On July 26 2012 we said:

Yesterday's low was 63 cents and it traded up to 64c in the last hour. A trade at 66 will be a breakout from
yesterdays trading range (high of 65.5) and 72.5 is the top of the week’s range. AWC is very well bid and
we expect a short covering rally off the double bottom.

In the month of July 2007 AWC spiked to a high of $7.225 and the low of last week of 62.5 cents was the
lowest ever.

What Happened?

It more than doubled at best. August 13 2012 it hit a high of 80.5 cents, 18 trading days after our report.

What Now?

AWC has recently traded down off a double top at $1.34. It subsequently hit a low of $1.12 on March 12.
On March 13 it recorded a high of $1.235 (Darvas box high) and pulled back a little on the following 2
trading days. We expect it to breakout from the downtrend and retry the highs at $1.34.

Snapshot:
The origins of the Alcoa Worldwide Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC) partnership between Alcoa and
WMC Limited (now Alumina Limited) began in the early 1960’s following the exploration and discovery of
bauxite deposits and other resources by WMC Limited and two other Australian companies. The
Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) was invited to join the project to provide technology, aluminium
expertise and finance. The venture formed Alcoa of Australia Ltd (AofA), an integrated aluminium
company, in 1961 with WMC Limited holding a 20% interest and Alcoa a 51% interest.

Over the following years the venture grew to include refineries and smelter interests as the partners
sought to take opportunities to expand the business.

By 1990, WMC Limited’s interests in Alcoa of Australia had grown to 48.25% through acquiring the
minority interests of other participants, other than Alcoa.
In July 1994, WMC decided to expand this interest as a worldwide bauxite, alumina and alumina-based
chemicals enterprise.
WMC Limited and Alcoa combined their respective bauxite, alumina and alumina-based chemicals
businesses and investments and some selected smelting operations to create Alcoa World Alumina and
Chemicals (AWAC) in January 1995.

Following the demerger of WMC into WMR and AWC, both began trading on December 4 202, closing at
$3.80 on 2.3m shares and $4.72 on 3.5m shares respectively, together up 32c on the theoretical.

(WMR, first bid for by Xstrata whose offer lapsed in 2004, was acquired by BHP in 2005).
Alumina today
Alumina's only business activity is as the owner of a 40% share in a joint venture with Alcoa called Alcoa
World Alumina and Chemicals, abbreviated to AWAC. AWAC's business is the mining of bauxite, the
extraction of alumina (aluminium oxide) and the smelting of pure aluminium. It has about 17% of the
global alumina market. Alcoa owns the remaining 60% of the business and acts as day-to-day manager.

In Australia, AWAC trades as Alcoa of Australia (AoA), which owns two bauxite mines and three refineries
(to extract aluminium oxide from bauxite) in Western Australia and owns a smelter (to extract pure
aluminium metal) and has a controlling interest in another in Victoria.
AWAC also has operations or interests in Texas, Suriname, Jamaica, Brazil, Spain, Guinea, and owns
Alcoa Steamship.

AWAC is the largest bauxite miner, producing approximately 40 Mtpa with long life mines and leases.
AWAC is the largest seller to the third party alumina market.

It is a relatively low cost produce, reflecting its bauxite sources.

It has bauxite mines in Australia, Brazil, CBG Guinea, Jamaica and Suriname.
It has alumina refineries in Australia, Brazil, Jamaica, Spain, Suriname and the US.

Page17of289©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On Feb 18 2014: Alcoa and Alumina Ltd announced the Point Henry Aluminium smelter is being
permanently closed, Alumina Ltd reported. The Point Henry smelter is owned by AWAC, which is owned
60% and managed by Alcoa Inc and 40% owned by Alumina Ltd.

Total AWAC restructuring related charges associated with the Point Henry smelter are expected to be
approximately $250 million.

Alcoa said the smelter, where 500 workers are employed, would cease operation in August.

Additionally, a Geelong rolling mill along with a rolling mill and recycling centre at Yennora in Sydney
would close by the end of the year with the loss of a further 480 jobs.
The 50-year-old smelter had no prospect of becoming economically viable, the company said in a
statement.
Alcoa will actively seek a buyer or the AWAC Anglesea coal mine and power station, which supplies
approximately 40% of the power needs for the Point Henry smelter, which has the potential to operate as
a standalone facility after the smelter closes.

*Full year 2013 profit result
On February 20 2014 Alumina Ltd for the year ended December 31 2013 announced net profit after tax of
$US500,000 vs loss of $US55.6 million in 2012. Net profit after tax includes net charges for the Alba legal
matter of $US16.5 million. Net debt is down $US529 million to $US135 million and gearing was reduced
to 4.6%. No final dividend was announced.
EBITDA was up $US280 million to $US728 million before significant items.
Cash cost of alumina per tonne produced was down 5.5%.
Free cash flow $US0 million vs a deficit of $US3 million in 2012.

Outlook

In the outlook statement CEO Peter Wasow said market conditions remain challenging, approximately
65% of AWAC's 3rd party alumina shipments are on spot or index basis. The company will benefit in $A
terms with a stronger $US.
AWAC's sustaining and growth capex forecast to fall to approximately $US265 million. The Point Henry
smelter will close in the third quarter.
So far in 2014 Alumina has received $US34 million capital repayment from AWAC.

Analysts expectations: $33.9 mln, div 1c/$14.7 mln, div 1c.

From the presentation on February 26 by Andrew Wood to the Metal Bulletin Conference in Miami
Mr Wood said the AWAC j/v is the world's largest bauxite and alumina producer with 7+ bauxite mines
and 8 refineries, with 15.8 million tonnes of alumina produced in 2013.

2 smelters had j/v production of 354,000 tonnes of aluminium in 2013 (Point Henry is to shut in 2014).

Mine and refinery 1.8m tonne project in Saudi Arabia in j/v with Ma'aden (AWAC 25.1) is under
construction. He said there were some opportunities to move down the cost curve by switching to cheaper
energy sources like natural gas or coal. Bauxite and alumina industry is a price taker on caustic soda
and on freight. He did not expect major export of alumina from China, and was on the whole positive on
the industry - foreseeing significantly rising demand.

Broker recommendations:

Actively followed by brokers

Following AWC's February 20 profit result:

*A leading broker on February 20 lifted its price target from $1.04 to $1.12. The broker said there are signs
of recovery in the 2013 result. Cash flow from ops of $US68 million and net debt of $US135 million were
in line. Underlying earnings negative $US3 million was a modest loss and there was no dividend, as
expected.
At the AWAC j/v level underlying EBITDA of $US726 million was 40% up on the broker's expectations,
giving an EBITDA margin of 12% which wile still low has steadily improved from the 6% level in 2012.

The net impact from the planned closure of the Point Henry smelter is difficult to gauge as attributable
costs were never separated out. Back calculating from Alcoaalumina segment data and AWAC financials,
we estimate that the two smelters were running at breakeven, so we assume Point Henry was loss making
and Portland profitable. .. the closure costs are covered by debt at the AWC level, so there is no cash call
on Alumina Ltd.
"After incorporating alumina production guidance of 16Mt in 2014 (plus Maaden uplift in 2015), assuming
further cost out and removing point Henry volumes and costs we have eps upgrades of 10/13%. We
increase our price target by 7%, but we still lag the equity, which seems to capture more
alumina/aluminium price upside than we have forecast".
