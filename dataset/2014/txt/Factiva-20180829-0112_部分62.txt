TOKYO -- Kirin Holdings will start offering milk in China as early as June to capitalize on the country's
growing demand for high-quality dairy beverages.
The Japanese company will sell ultra-high-temperature processed milk, or long-life milk, which can
sit on store shelves for up to nine months -- the top-selling type at Chinese grocery stores now.

The product will be shipped from a factory of Australian subsidiary Lion and sold at several hundred
stores run by beverage retailer China Resources Enterprise, a local partner.
The milk will sell for around 25 yuan ($4.02) a liter, more than twice what milk from Chinese
companies costs. Kirin will market it as a high-quality alternative to locally produced milk to woo
middle- and upper-class consumers in Shanghai and other metropolitan areas.
Kirin has a nonalcoholic-drinks joint venture with China Resources Enterprise, which operates some
4,500 retail shops, including upscale supermarkets. The two firms will introduce the Australian milk to
more locations depending on how it sells.
Growing ranks of Chinese and Southeast Asians are consuming high-quality dairy beverages and
products. Demand is racing ahead at a particularly fast pace in China, where people traditionally did
not consume much milk. "Annual demand exceeds supply by 6 million kiloliters, which is more than
the size of the Japanese beer market," says a Kirin official.
Kirin also plans to launch sales of non-refrigerated milk and milk-based drinks in Vietnam and other
parts of Southeast Asia later this year. Vietnamese subsidiary Interfood is expected to obtain a license
as an importer.
Kirin seeks to develop milk and dairy products into a third core income source after beer and soft
drinks. Australian unit Lion boasts high brand recognition and is situated in an ideal location as an
export base for China and Southeast Asia.
