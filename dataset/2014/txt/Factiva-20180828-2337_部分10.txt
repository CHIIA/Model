Release date - 19092014
The Directors of IronClad Mining Ltd (IFE: ASX) are pleased to provide an update of the Wilcherry Hill
Iron Ore Project in the North of the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.

TD

The Project is an 80%: 20% Joint Venture with Trafford Resources Limited (TRF: ASX).

Highlights
Discussions with Arrium on Iron Ore Mine Gate Sales progressing.
Possible Mining Start up in November.

Desk Top Study of DMS Indicates Larger, Higher Grade Stage 1 Potential.

Strong Manganese Drill Results at Hercules.

Dry Magnetic Separation.
Stage One is defined as mining and sale of Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) and specification ore that can be
produced by a simple Dry Magnetic Separation (DMS) process.
Stage Two is defined as the mining, processing and sale of ore that is not DSO, nor amenable to
upgrade by DMS, but can be upgraded to specification by a relatively simple gravity separation process.

Arrium

Discussions are currently being held between the Wilcherry Hill Joint Venture (IFE 80% and TRF 20%)
and Arrium Limited (previously One Steel Limited) regarding the potential sale of the Joint Venture’s
direct shipping iron ore (DSO) from the Wilcherry Hill mining leases, approximately 40 kms North of the
town of Kimba in South Australia.

If agreement is reached with Arrium, it is the Joint Venture’s intention to mine an initial trial pit at the
Weednanna deposit. The trial pit will be designed to generate both high grade iron ore for direct sale to
Arrium and bulk samples for ongoing beneficiation test work.
All statutory mining approvals have been in place at Wilcherry Hill for some time. Mining of the proposed
pit could, therefore, commence as soon as commercial terms have been agreed with Arrium and mining
and transport contracts have been put in place. Subject to the above, mining could start in November
2014 with exports and revenues commencing in the first quarter of 2015.

Metallurgical Testwork

Previous Dry Magnetic Separation (DMS) production was designed around a 6.3 millimeter product size.
This process produced a product grade of approximately 58% Fe with a resource to reserve conversion
rate of approximately 20%.
The increased supply of Iron ore in world markets continues to depress prices, particularly for sub 62%
Fe. ore. In order to maintain margins and avoid the heavy discounting experienced for sub 62% Fe,

Page34of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Ironclad has recently completed a desktop study to determine the viability of creating a +62% Fe product
by enhanced DMS methodology.
On the basis of metallurgical test work completed to date and a study of similar operations in Mauritania,
the desktop study confirmed the feasibility of creating a high grade concentrate using DMS. Importantly
the study indicated that a resource to reserve conversion rate of between 60% and 70% could be
achieved. The optimum particle size for this process will be determined by ongoing test work.

The additional metallurgical work to confirm the details of this study is now planned. It will focus
particularly on crushing / grinding options. Methods under consideration include high pressure grinding
rollers (HPGRs) and conventional coarse grinding circuits.

If successful it will mean that, including the existing DSO material, Stage One could be expanded to
between 6 and 8 million tonnes of premium (+62% Fe), low contaminant product, depending on prices
and the USD / AUD exchange rate - or an approximate 4 to 5 year production period. The Company is
also evaluating a number of new innovative processes to beneficiate the lower grade ore.

Early test work has been encouraging.

Manganese

Highlights:

2,187 metres RC drilling completed at Hercules East and Hercules North.

Mineralization at Hercules East defined over a strike length 250m. Up-dip extensions to the east
confirmed.

Manganese intersected at Hercules North.

Overall results include:

8m @ 16.81% Mn (14HCRC014, 32m - 40m)

5m @ 28.22% Mn (14HCRC017, 11m -16m)

5m @ 19.46% Mn (14HCRC023, 33m - 38m)

5m @ 24.72% Mn (14HCRC031, 8m - 13m)
IronClad Mining Ltd’s Managing Director Robert Mencel said - ‘These drilling results continue to reinforce
the notion that IronClad Mining has discovered a substantial manganese system. Based upon the grades
and widths intersected, the Hercules East prospect is likely to be economically significant.’

At the Hercules East Manganese Prospect, the objective was to test for up dip and strike extensions to
the mineralization intersected during the January 2014, 7 hole drilling campaign. At the Hercules North
Manganese Prospect, the objective was reconnaissance exploration to assess the potential of the
anomaly identified in the surface geochemical survey and follow up drilling testing the extent of the
previous manganese intersection in hole 13HCRC001 (7m @ 20.2% Mn).

Encouraging intercepts of manganese mineralization were again recorded. Highlights include:

8m @ 16.8% Mn (14HCRC014, 32 - 40m)

5m @ 28.22% Mn (14HCRC017, 11-16m)

5m @ 19.46% Mn (14HCRC023, 33 - 38m)

5m @ 24.72% Mn (14HCRC031, 8 - 13m)

Hercules East Manganese Prospect.

Fifteen holes at nominal 50m x 50m spacing were completed. The results extended the mineralization
intersected in January 2014 to a total strike length of 250m. Mineralization was extended up dip to the
east by 35m.

Hercules North Manganese Prospect

Eleven drill holes were completed in this prospect area. Nine holes were aimed at testing a broad
geochemical anomaly and 2 were designed to follow up the previous manganese intersection in hole

Page35of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.13HCRC001 (7m @ 20.2%). Drillholes spacing were up to 200m x 50m Four of the reconnaissance holes
intersected anomalous manganese mineralization at greater that 10% Mn, the highlight being
14HCRC031 returning 5m @ 24.7% Mn from 8 - 13m down hole.

Drill hole spacing was up to 200m x 50m in this area. At this stage it is believed that the source of the
Manganese lag anomaly has not been fully tested. Follow up drilling of hole 13HCRC001 confirmed an up
dip extension to the mineralization with 14HCRC014 intersecting 8m @ 16.8% Mn from 32m - 40m.
Banded iron formation sequences similar to those intersected at Hercules East were logged in all 11
holes.

Pier Dam Prospect

First phase geological mapping complete.

8km strike length of enriched manganese mineralization identified.

Grades up to 44.2% Mn.

Prospectivity

Geological mapping and surface rock chip sampling was completed over the 50km2 area Pier Dam
Manganese prospect. The results verify the significant manganese mineralization noted at this prospect
since the late 1970’s by previous explorers.

Scattered outcrops and sub-crops of surface enriched manganese oxide occur throughout the prospect
area and define an 8km NW mineralized corridor

Processing Desktop Study

A preliminary desktop study into the processing of potential manganese ores from the Hercules and Pier
Dam prospects was completed.
Surface ore samples and drill chips have shown a declining iron content with increasing manganese
grade which may lead to production of at least two products - a manganese ore with low iron content and
a manganese/iron ore with higher iron content.
Preliminary test work on the manganese ore to date indicates that gravity concentration represents the
best processing option.

Trafford Manganese Joint Venture.

The ‘earn in’ period, during which IronClad has the right to earn up to an 80% interest in the manganese
rights on the joint venture tenements, has been extended by mutual agreement, by an additional 12
months.

Finance
Despite receiving all major approvals in October 2013, financing of the $23 Million capital required for
stage one commencement has proved difficult to achieve in the current low iron ore price climate.

With share prices at 2 and 3 year lows across most companies in the junior resource sector the directors
resolved to minimise share holder dilution by acquiring the startup capital via debt facilities at this time.
Several forms of debt providers were, therefore, pursued. These included Australian and overseas,
conventional retail and commodity banks as well as a range of end users in China, Japan, Korea and
India. In addition, several trading houses and other commercial loan providers were also approached
including some from the Middle East.

Generally speaking the conventional retail and commodity banks approached by IronClad found the debt
capital requirement of too small a scale to fit their lending criteria. The two to three year start up period
also proved to be of too short a duration to cover their internal risk profiles. End users, trading houses and
none bank loan providers were much more receptive to the project and a number of detailed discussions
were held.

Several negotiations were well advanced by the beginning of the year. However the rapid cyclical decline
in Chinese ore prices since the beginning of this year has caused most third parties to place these
discussions on hold.

Page36of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In light of the above, an approach was made to Arrium - with a view to IronClad negotiating a ‘mine gate’
sale of its ore to the exporter. A potential ‘mine gate’ sale to Arrium Limited provides IronClad with a low
capital start up option. Arrium have been receptive to the concept and discussions are ongoing.
