CHINESE company Landbridge Group has triumphed in its $178 million hostile cash offer for
coal-seam gas producer WestSide Corporation, with the group moving to majority ownership
yesterday.

Landbridge told the Australian Securities Exchange that it had increased its interest in WestSide to
50.28 per cent, building on the momentum gained through the acceptance of the bid by WestSide’s
major shareholder New Hope Corporation.

WestSide’s directors conceded last week that the sale of New Hope’s 17.7 per cent interest into the
Landbridge offer meant it was likely to take control of the company.

The board of WestSide cited Landbridge’s looming move to majority ownership as a key reason for
its decision last Friday to “reluctantly” begin recommending shareholders accept the bid.

“Landbridge’s effective control of WestSide means that it will be in a position to substantially
determine the composition of the WestSide board and senior management and the strategic direction
of the company, including the method and source of funding for the development of its assets,”
WestSide chairman Robert Neale said in a letter to shareholders.

Landbridge is offering 40c for each WestSide share.

New Hope previously had been touted as a potential counterbidder for WestSide, given the
significant shareholding and its $1.1 billion cash pile. There had also been speculation the company
could be of interest to the big CSG-fed liquefied natural gas projects being built near WestSide’s
assets in Queensland.

But WestSide acknowledged that its efforts to secure an alternative offer had fallen short despite
talks with several parties.

“We have all worked very hard to reposition WestSide for success, so it is disappointing … to see
effective control of the company pass at this price before any of the benefits from that success can
be reaped,” Mr Neale said.WestSide’s key asset is a 51 per cent interest in the Meridian CSG fields
160km west of Gladstone.
