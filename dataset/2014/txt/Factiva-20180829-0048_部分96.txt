0038 GMT [Dow Jones] Mineral Resources (MIN.AU) is likely to have lost more than just A$20 million
from its failed attempt to acquire Aquila Resources (AQA.AU). According to Macquarie, the Australian
company's reputation will have taken a beating, too. Mineral Resources ditched plans for an all-scrip
offer for Aquila worth A$3.75 a share--the same price it paid for a 13% stake. That cleared the field for
China's Baosteel and Aurizon Holdings to buy Aquila for A$3.40 a share. "In addition to the financial
loss, Mineral Resources has some fences to repair, both with key customers and government
stakeholders post this transaction," says Macquarie, which has cut the stock to neutral. Adding to Mineral
Resources's problems is a falling iron-ore price, which prompted Macquarie to cut its FY15 EPS forecast
by 29.3% and lower its price target by 29% to A$9.94. MIN is at A$9.42. (david.winning@wsj.com;
