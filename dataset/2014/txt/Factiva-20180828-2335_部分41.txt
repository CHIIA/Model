A patchy rally gave way under the weight of nervousness as enthusiasm waned. Early gains withered on
the vine after topping out at 5412 and closing at 5382 up 6 for the day as financials went nowhere with
Westpac Banking Corporation (A$32.21, -0.8%) hitting the skids. Other banks were relatively unchanged
as BHP Billiton Limited (A$34.79, +0.3%) and RIO Tinto Limited (A$61.50, +1.2%) bounced hard. Seems
the record production from the big three continues unabated as they sacrifice price for volume. Small ore
players were still under the kosh with their marginal production profitability with Mount Gibson Iron
Limited (A$0.61, -1.6%),BC Iron Limited (A$1.785, -3.5%),Atlas Iron Limited (A$0.49, -2.0%) sliding but
Arrium Limited (A$0.385, +1.3%) finding some support.

Gold stocks were on the nose again as the shiny stuff continues to look stuffed. You would have hoped
that with all the world's issues at the moment it would really help gold,oil etc. Nah, not to be it seems
.Newcrest Mining Limited (A$10.32, -0.7%),Silver Lake Resources Limited (A$0.41, -4.7%),St Barbara
Limited (A$0.15, -6.3%),Kingsgate Consolidated Limited (A$0.74, -3.9%) to name a few of the casualties.
Sirius Resources NL (A$3.32, +6.8%) perked up a bit after yesterday's rout as saner heads prevailed
.Sandfire Resources NL (A$5.80, unch) also did ok with Syrah Resources Limited (A$4.64,
+3.1%),Western Areas Limited (A$4.53, +2.3%) and Orocobre Limited (A$2.80, +8.5%) bringing up the
rear. Energy stocks continued to lose ground led by Woodside Petroleum Limited (A$41.01,
-1.2%),Karoon Gas Australia Limited (A$3.52, -3.0%),Oil Search Limited (A$9.11, -0.3%) and Santos
Limited (A$14.07, -0.4%).

? In the industrial disease today Tpg Telecom Limited (A$7.28, +3.1%) was a standout as it announced
plans to launch its own premium TV service with content from Foxtel. However other media stocks like
Seven West Media Limited (A$1.61, -1.2%),Southern Cross Media Group Limited (A$0.99, -2.9%) and
#NEC# fared less well. Fairfax Media Limited (A$0.805, +3.2%) bucked the trend as did #STW#.

(A$2.99, +2.4%),TAH# and Echo Entertainment Group Limited (A$3.30, +1.2%). Nothing shaking but the
trees in the big Ws with flip flopping around the order of the day for Woolworths Limited (A$34.98,
+0.5%),Wesfarmers Limited (A$42.99, +0.1%) and Westfield Group (A$10.84, unch).

+10.0%) and Orocobre Limited (A$2.80, +8.5%) in the smalls department. Losers were Iron Road Limited

-4.4%),Bradken Limited (A$4.23, -4.5%),Myer Holdings Limited (A$1.94, -3.5%),JB Hi-Fi Limited
