2341 GMT [Dow Jones] Regulatory approval in Australia for Starpharma Holdings Ltd.'s (SPL.AU)
VivaGel-coated condoms validates the technology and markets the company's transition to a
commercial entity from a research and development firm, says Morgans. The certification for the
condoms, which Starpharma says will support certain regulatory processes in other markets, is critical for
commercial success and revenue generation near and medium-term, Morgans says. Still, it adds that,
while the product differs from rivals, it may take time to build the brand awareness that will drive strong
demand. It has an add recommendation and A$1.40/share ($1.31) target. SPL last traded at A$0.70.

2339 GMT [Dow Jones]--The Nikkei is likely to rise as geopolitical concerns over Eastern Europe and the
Near East have eased somewhat. Nikkei 225 September futures ended Chicago trading at 15275
Monday, compared to Friday's Osaka close at 15210. Tokyo markets were off Monday for a national
holiday. "Both U.S. stocks and CME futures were up with Friday's and Monday's trading combined. We
are going to see relatively solid trading today," says Eiji Kinouchi, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
He says, though, Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co.'s (8750.TO) new shares that will become available for
trading on Thursday could worsen the market conditions if the share prices fall below the offering price of
Y1,401. Dai-ichi shares fell 0.9% to Y1,413 on Friday. The Nikkei dropped 1.0% to 15215.71 on Friday.

2327 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse cuts Australand Property Group (ALZ.AU) to Neutral from
Outperform as it doesn't expect a counterbid from Stockland Australia (SGP.AU), leaving Frasers
Centrepoint Ltd.'s (TQ5.SG) A$4.48 ($4.20) cash bid likely to succeed. "Frasers' $4.48 cash bid is above
our takeover net asset value of $4.40 and implies an FY16 PE ratio of 12 times on peak cycle earnings,"
the broker says. Target price is A$4.48. ALZ last A$4.49. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

2323 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse analyst Peter Wilson assumes coverage of APA Group (APA.AU),
lifting the price target to A$6.35 a share from A$6.25 after the company enters agreements with
AngloGold (AU) to transport gas to two mines. Mr. Wilson says the supply deal should offer a small
incremental bump-up in earnings, the order of A$5 million in Ebitda in fiscal 2016 and A$10 million in
FY17. Still, with the shares trading at a premium to the valuation, Credit Suisse retains its underperform
stance. APA last traded at A$7.15. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
2322 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan bumps up its price target on Australand Property Group (ALZ.AU)
to A$4.50/share ($4.22) from A$4.47 after the company's first-half operating profit came in 1.5% ahead
of the broker's forecast. It sticks with a neutral recommendation. J.P. Morgan notes ALZ's residential Ebit
was below its estimate, although earnings for the division appear to be skewed to the second half, while
industrial activity for the company remains subdued even though ALZ says enquiry levels from logistics
providers and large retailers has improved. ALZ last traded at A$4.49. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2317 GMT [Dow Jones] Tabcorp (TAH.AU) remains vulnerable to competition from corporate
bookmakers, says CIMB, which keeps a "reduce" recommendation on the Australian wagering company.
"We expect FY15 to be a difficult year for Tabcorp as it struggles to adapt to the market shifting away
from its strong position of retail and tote towards the online fixed-odds world, where it faces sophisticated

A$3.47. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2310 GMT [Dow Jones]--The USD/JPY will likely remain in a tight range in directionless Asia trade, says
Osao Iizuka, head of spot FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. The market "still lacks momentum,"
as depicted in the USD/JPY's inability to break below 101 despite risk aversion mode caused by
geopolitical tensions in eastern Ukraine and Gaza, says Mr. Iizuka, who tips the pair will likely trade in
101.10-101.70 range. The pair won't likely show a clear direction without a further worsening in
geopolitical instability, he says. The pair is at 101.40 against 101.39 in New York late Monday. The
EUR/USD is tipped in a 1.3500-1.3570 range. It is at 1.3525. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)
2247 GMT [Dow Jones] The a2 Milk Company Ltd. (ATM.NZ) jumped 9.8% to NZ$0.67 ($0.58) after the
company said it has been approved to resume shipments of its Platinum infant formula to China. As of
May 1, under new rules, makers of infant formula must be registered with Chinese regulators to be able
to export their products to the country. The rules also require any company exporting baby formula to
have control over the entire manufacturing process. A2 Milk says it is confident it has the systems in
place to fulfil the ongoing criteria of China's regulatory agencies relating to the production, importation
and distribution of the infant formula. "It's exciting stuff for them" and the market has taken it positively
with the stock opening up nearly 10%, says Macquarie Equities Investment Advisor Brad Gordon.

6:44 p.m. EDT -- Plans by BRICS countries to create a Contingent Reserve Arrangement, also dubbed a
"mini IMF," to provide mutual liquidity support in time of crisis "may have limited practical value," UBS
notes. The move is rather seen as "more symbolic by moving away from U.S./IMF influence in the new
world order." In contrast, plans to set up a new development bank to support infrastructure projects could
be potentially positive in the medium-term, as it expands the credit markets, UBS adds.

2241 GMT [Dow Jones] Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) has already answered two of the big
questions heading into its 2Q earnings call. The carrier said two weeks ago it added more than 1.4
million of the lucrative postpaid subscribers, more than doubling consensus estimates. Verizon CEO
Lowell McAdam also made clear he isn't interested in making a big acquisition, such as buying Dish
Network Corp. (DISH) or a content company. Less clear, however, is what exactly Verizon's video
strategy looks like. The carrier has said it is working on a service to deliver video over the Internet, but
little else. Analysts will be paying close attention Tuesday during Verizon's early-morning call for any sign
of an emerging strategy. The company releases results at 6:30 a.m. EDT and a call with analysts is
scheduled an hour later. (ryan.knutson@wsj.com; Twitter: @ryan_knutson)
2232 GMT -- Asian equity markets are likely to remain subdued because of ongoing geopolitical
tensions, a weak lead from the U.S. and ahead of the HSBC's China flash manufacturing PMI on
Thursday. The PMI data "will be the biggest news for the region" over the week, says Macquarie Equities
Investment Advisor Brad Gordon. "The trend for the PMI in China has been pretty positive for China
over the past three or four months," so any upside will be well received, he says. In New Zealand, the a2
Milk Co. (ATM.NZ) is up 9.8% at 67 New Zealand cents after the company say it has received approval
from regulatory agencies in China to resume shipments of its Platinum infant formula. Otherwise, Mr.
Gordon expects the market to remain subdued ahead of reporting season. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com;

2234 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan adds Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG.AU) and Asciano Ltd. (AIO.AU),
while removing Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AU) and Ramsay Health Care Ltd. (RHC.AU) to its
model Australian quantitative portfolio. JPM analyst Berowne Hlavaty says the recent value rally
continues while the large stable "expensive defensives" stocks suffer. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:
