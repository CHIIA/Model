Cinema chain Hoyts Group is planning an international roadshow to market a potential $900 million
initial public offering and is likely to appoint investment banks to join UBS in running the float.

It is understood the company is likely to embark on an investor roadshow to Asia, Europe and North
America in November with a view to listing the company in December.

Sources said one or two more investment banks would likely be appointed in coming weeks, with
Macquarie Group and Citigroup in the mix. Appointments may be held back until after reporting
season as ASX-listed companies wind down at the end of the month.
The decision to float Hoyts comes after private owner Pacific Equity Partners ruled out interest from
trade buyers. It is understood trade parties including Chinese company Dalian Wanda looked at
Hoyts.
PEP bought Hoyts Group in December 2007 in a deal valuing the company at $440 million.

Hoyts is the region's second-largest cinema operator with about 450 screens and 44 cinema
complexes, according to PEP's website. It also has a movies-to-home offering and owns the Val
Morgan cinema advertising brand.

Damian Keogh was promoted to chief executive of Hoyts in February after a successful tenure at the
helm of Val Morgan.
