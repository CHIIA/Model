The Anti-Dumping Commission is investigating a claim by Arrium subsidiary OneSteel that a raft of
steel exporters, including South Korea, Thailand and Turkey, is damaging the company by
"dumping" cheap product in Australia.
The investigation comes in the wake of Arrium's $754 million equity raising, undertaken to reduce
debt in the face of collapsing iron ore prices and sustained losses in the steel business.

OneSteel lodged an application on August 8 requesting that Bob Baldwin, parliamentary secretary to
Minister for Industry Ian Macfarlane, publish a dumping duty notice in respect of steel reinforcing bar
(rebar) exported to Australia from South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and
Turkey.

OneSteel alleges the Australian steel industry has "suffered material injury" in the form of lost sales
volumes, reduced market share, lower prices and reduced profits due to the export of rebar at prices
below actual product value.

OneSteel was spun out of BHP Billiton in 2000 and is Australia's only producer of rebar. It
manufactures rebar products at Whyalla, Laverton and Newcastle.
The size of the Australian rebar market was between 750,000 tonnes and 1 million tonnes in
2013-14.
Arrium's OneSteel business sold 2.07 million tonnes of steel in 2013-14 and generated a paltry
$51 million of earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) on $2.9 billion
of revenue.

The anti-dumping claim covers steel products that account for about 30 per cent of OneSteel's total
sales.

In 2013-14 imports from the countries accused of dumping increased by 20 per cent on the prior year,
compared with 2 per cent growth the year before.Canada case

OneSteel said that the size of the Australian rebar market contracted 2 per cent in 2013-14 and that
its owns sales declined by 5 per cent while exports of dumped rebar from the nominated countries
increased by 33 per cent.
As a softening Chinese property market and anaemic global economic growth dampen steel
demand, a lot of product is looking for a home.

The Canada Border Services Agency launched an investigation into alleged dumping of concrete
reinforcing bar from China, South Korea, and Turkey on June 13.

subsidiary of Arrium's mining consumables business. The Canadian authority found dumping had
occurred and imposed provisional duties (as a proportion of the export price) ranging from 14.8 per
cent to 58.1 per cent.
On September 3, Malaysia initiated an investigation into rebar products from South Korea and China
and on September 9 the US Department of Commerce found steel from Mexico had been dumped in
the US.

Anti-Dumping Commissioner Dale Seymour will investigate steel exports to Australia from July 1,
2013 to July 30, 2014 and examine the steel market from July 1, 2010.

"The commission is satisfied that . . . there appears to be reasonable grounds for concluding that rebar
has been exported to Australia from the nominated countries at dumped prices and the dumping
margins are not negligible," the commission said.

"The commission considers that injury to the Australian industry appears to have been caused by
allegedly dumped imports of rebar."

After the investigation Mr Baldwin will determine whether to reject OneSteel's claim or to impose
interim dumping duties.

A statement of essential facts will be published on February 4, 2015. The commissioner will make a
recommendation to Mr Baldwin on or before March 23 2015, unless the investigation is terminated.
