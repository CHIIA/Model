Corporate taxes: Overview
The federal government levies corporate income tax on company profits at a rate of 30%. Companies that
are wholly owned by the same parent company may file a single tax return and be taxed as a single
entity.

A company is considered a resident of Australia for tax purposes if it is incorporated or operates in
Australia and meets either of two criteria: its central management or shareholders controlling voting power
are in Australia, or its voting power is controlled by shareholders who are residents of Australia. Australia
resident companies must declare all profits earned in Australia and overseas. Offsets are available for
taxes paid on foreign-sourced income in countries with which Australia has a double-tax treaty. A
non-resident company that receives Australian-sourced income must file an Australian tax return and pay
tax on income earned in Australia, except for interest, unfranked dividends (paid from untaxed profits) or
royalties subject to withholding tax. The applicable tax rates for these forms of income are 10% for interest
and 30% for unfranked dividends and royalties. These tax rates are reduced if a double-tax treaty applies.
No Australian tax is payable on franked dividends since the local company already has paid the full
amount of Australian tax on its profit (see Taxes on interest and dividends).

Foreign-owned companies or joint ventures with international corporations are usually treated as public
companies for Australian tax purposes. Joint ventures can be either incorporated or unincorporated. Most
joint ventures are incorporated; hence, a separate company conducts the business of the joint venture,
and each joint-venture participant is a shareholder in that company. Because it is a separate company,
any profits of the joint venture are taxed at the company level. Similarly, any losses suffered by the joint
venture do not flow through to the shareholder participants but remain at the company level and may be
carried forward to offset future profits. Unincorporated joint ventures are more prevalent when the
business is not yet making profits (such as a biotech operation that focuses on research and
development). In an unincorporated joint venture, each participant files a separate tax return.

The federal government applies a 40% resource rent tax (Petroleum Resource Rent Tax-PRRT) on
taxable profits from the recovery of petroleum products from most offshore oil-and-gas fields. As from July
1st 2012 the PRRT extends to onshore petroleum projects, including coal-seam gas, oil-shale and
tight-gas projects. In addition, the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT), approved in March 2012 and
implemented on July 1st 2012, imposes a 30% tax on coal and iron-ore mining profits. The MRRT
scheme includes an extraction allowance of 25% that offsets the tax, in effect reducing it to 22.5%. The
MRRT applies only to yearly mining profits that exceed A$75m. A partial tax credit is available for miners
with profits of A$75m-125m. The current administration of Tony Abbott, the prime minister, announced in
October 2013 that it would repeal the MRRT with effect from July 1st 2014. As of August 2014 the repeal
bill was still being reconciled in Parliament.

Corporate taxes: Corporate tax rates
The corporate tax is a flat-rate tax levied at 30% on the taxable income of a company. Basic tax rates and
treatment are the same for all companies, including branches of foreign companies. There is no difference
in the tax treatment of retained profits and distributed profits, and there is no excess-profits tax or
alternative-minimum tax.

Page96of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The Labor government of Julia Gillard, the former prime minister, had tried to cut the corporate tax rate to
28% during her administration that ended in June 2013. Since then, the Liberal-National coalition has
pledged to cut the corporate tax rate to 28.5%, but legislation to this effect had yet to be proposed as of
August 2014.
Corporate taxes, 2014/15*
The following is an example of the variation in
tax burden for shareholders of a foreign-owned
company in Australia, depending
on whether dividends are franked (payable from taxed income) or unfranked
(payable from untaxed income), and whether a tax treaty exists. Unfranked
dividends are paid from income on which corporate tax has not been paid,
typically because of the carry-forward of a prior year’s losses. Taxable
income is reduced, but the income available for distribution as dividends
remains the same.
The table assumes that a company pays 50% of the
income available for distribution as a dividend. Columns A and B relate to the
payment of unfranked dividends. If the foreign shareholder resides in a
country
with which Australia does not have a tax treaty, withholding tax of 30%
applies
(Column A); if a tax treaty exists, this typically drops to 15% (Column B). If
the dividends paid have been franked, no further tax is payable by the foreign
shareholder (Column C).

Corporate taxes: Taxable income defined
To compute taxable income, a company calculates gross income (for a resident company, income from
worldwide sources; for a non-resident company, income from Australian sources) and deducts any
exempt income.
The company then subtracts allowable expenses and deductions (including royalties, management fees
and interest paid to non-residents if these expenses conform to commercial standards).
Thin-capitalisation rules apply to the Australian operations of foreign companies investing in Australia and
to Australian companies investing overseas. The rules aim to prevent the application of an excessive
amount of debt against income that is taxable in Australia. Generally, these rules disallow tax deductions
for interest payments on debt when a company's debt/equity ratio exceeds 3:1. When calculating their
taxable income, companies may deduct most indirect taxes paid-such as payroll tax and fringe-benefits
tax. Dividend payments are not deductible. Domestic losses generally may be carried forward indefinitely,
but they may not be carried back.

Wholly owned groups of companies and trusts may choose to be taxed as consolidated entities but should
note that this option is irrevocable. Consolidation reduces impediments to group restructuring, allows for
pooling of losses within the group and allows for tax-free movement of assets within a group without any
formal rollover requirements. This allows a group to buy back shares without triggering a capital gain or
loss and to liquidate a member entity without triggering deemed dividends or capital gains or losses. It also
eliminates double taxation, where gains are taxed when realised and then taxed again on the disposal of
equity. Grouping concessions are not available for wholly owned groups that choose not to consolidate,
and thus a group may not transfer losses of foreign tax credits or assets between entities without
triggering a capital gain.

The tax regime aims to prevent the use of various tax-avoidance techniques, such as loss cascading
(creating multiple tax losses where there is only one economic loss), value shifting (creating artificial
losses where there is no actual economic loss) and tax avoidance through intra-group dealings.

Page97of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Australia taxes foreign-sourced income earned by Australian residents under an accruals-based regime. A
comprehensive foreign-tax-credit system applies to directly earned foreign income; credits are generally
available for the lesser of the foreign taxes paid or the Australian tax payable. Foreign tax credits may be
carried forward for five years but may not be carried back.

Most foreign income and capital gains derived by Australian companies via a permanent establishment
overseas is exempt from Australian taxation. The exemption also applies to income earned overseas by
Australian companies from investments in partnerships or trusts. In addition, the disposal by an Australian
company of non-portfolio shares in a foreign company is exempt from capital-gains tax in Australia.
Similarly, Australian investors enjoy an exemption on income from overseas investment funds if their
holding amounts to 10% or less of the investment fund's capital.

Corporate taxes: Depreciation

A unified-capital-allowance system applies to the effective life depreciation of all capital investments,
including patents and buildings. Spending on items associated with project development (such as
feasibility studies, site preparation and environmental assessment) may be written off over the life of the
project, whereas costs relating to establishing a business and raising equity may be written off over five
years. Certain "black hole" expenditures that do not create or improve an asset are immediately
deductible; these include costs such as export-market development and the cost of closing mines.

Small businesses with aggregated turnover of less than A$2m have access to a range of concessions,
including simplified depreciation and trading stock rules, simplified goods and services tax (GST)
accounting, tax credit apportionment and payment rules, and favourable capital gains tax exemptions and
rollovers.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) continually reviews the effective lives of assets held by a large range
of industries to ensure that they match with the rates at which the assets can be written off for tax
purposes. Special depreciation rates apply for primary-producer assets, research-and-development
expenditure and investment in Australian films. Mining companies enjoy immediate deductibility for
expenses for removing mining overburden (that is, removing nonproducing earth before reaching the
actual ore) and may roll over short-term hedging instruments without a taxation penalty.

Corporate taxes: Capital taxes
The federal government does not levy taxes on land. State governments levy property taxes based on the
improved value of property holdings (buildings and land). These are used to fund local services, such as
parks, community facilities and activities, street lighting, rubbish collection and some roads.

Corporate taxes: Treatment of capital gains

Companies are liable for tax on the full amount of any increase in the capital value of their assets. Net
capital gains are calculated by deducting the purchase price of an asset (no inflation indexing is available
for assets purchased after September 1999) from proceeds of the sale of the asset. Capital losses can be
carried forward to offset future capital gains.

Capital-gains tax (CGT) is not levied in some limited circumstances: where a fixed trust transfers all of its
assets to a company and then ceases to exist; and where assets are transferred between a trust and a
company as part of the process of converting the entity's structure from a trust to a company. In the latter
case, owners must hold shares in the company in the same proportion as their interests in the trust.
Relief from CGT is available for de-mergers-that is, the restructuring of a corporate or trust group by
splitting it into two or more entities or groups, with the underlying owners holding one or more of those
entities or groups directly. The relief is available where underlying ownership is maintained and the
de-merging entity divests at least 80% of its ownership interests in the de-merged entity. This allows CGT
relief at both shareholder and entity levels and provides an exemption from the existing dividend rules,
subject to integrity rules.

Shareholders who receive notional capital gains in a scrip-for-scrip takeover (for example, during an
acquisition when new shares are issued to replace the shares of the company that was taken over) may
opt not to pay CGT until the ultimate disposal of the acquired company's assets. Special rules apply to
non-resident shareholders, and the relief is not available to a non-resident acquiring an interest in an entity
if it does not reside in Australia.
Holders of convertible notes pay CGT when the relevant shares are sold, not when the notes are
converted into shares, as long as the notes were issued after May 14th 2002.

Page98of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.If assets were acquired prior to September 1999, eligible superannuation (pension) funds may choose
between the discount-method capital-gains system introduced in September 1985 and the subsequent
indexation-method system introduced in September 1999. (Capital gains were tax exempt until September
1985 and assets acquired before then do not pay capital-gains tax.) The discount method calculates the
capital gain as the difference between the proceeds and the cost base; a discount of 33% for
superannuation funds applies for assets held more than one year. The indexation method calculates the
capital gain as the difference between proceeds and the indexed cost base, with indexation stopped at
consumer prices in September 1999. For assets acquired after September 1999, Australian
superannuation funds (which pay income tax at 15%) are taxed on two-thirds of the gain, yielding an
effective CGT rate of 10%.

Australian residents are liable for tax on worldwide capital gains (subject to double-tax relief).
Non-residents are taxed on capital gains from Australian assets, including land, assets used in Australian
business, shares or interests in Australian private companies and trusts, and holdings of 10% or more of
the issued capital of Australian public companies. Holdings of less than 10% in Australian public
companies are not counted as Australian assets and any capital gain realised on the holding is not
included when CGT is assessed.

Special, complex rules apply when a taxpayer changes residency. Where non-residents are residents of a
country with which Australia has a double-tax treaty, there may be limited scope for using treaty protection
to limit Australian CGT in certain circumstances.

Some non-resident pension funds are exempt from CGT on gains from venture-capital investments in
Australia.
The disposal by an Australian company of non-portfolio shares in a foreign company is exempt from CGT
in Australia.
Since July 2003 businesses with international operations can take advantage of optional
functional-currency provisions and alternative options for calculating foreign-currency gains and losses on
certain foreign-currency-denominated bank accounts. For example, one optional method removes the
need to calculate gains and losses from certain accounts with a total balance of not more than the
equivalent of A$250,000.

Corporate taxes: Taxes on interest and dividends
Interest paid from an Australian business to an Australian resident business is not subject to withholding
tax. However, interest paid from an Australian business to a non-resident business is generally subject to
a 10% domestic withholding tax (less if there is a double-tax treaty).

Dividends paid by Australia-resident companies that come out of profits already taxed at the corporate rate
carry imputation credits for the tax paid. Dividends are referred to as "fully franked", "partially franked" or
"unfranked" depending on whether they are paid from fully taxed, tax-preferred or untaxed profits. Given
the opportunities for reducing tax liability through accelerated depreciation, loss carry-forwards and the
like, dividends might not always be fully taxable. All unfranked distributions are taxable in the hands of the
recipient, unless the distribution is within a wholly owned group that has elected to consolidate its
accounts. Where the corporate tax rate exceeds the marginal tax rate of the shareholder, a tax refund is
payable to the shareholder. Hence, Australian superannuation (pension) funds, which pay income tax at
15%, receive refunds for imputation credits that exceed their tax liability.

Australia's double-tax treaties generally allow for a withholding tax of 15% on dividends paid to
non-resident shareholders, though a lower rate sometimes applies (for example, under a protocol to the
Australia-US treaty, implemented in mid-2003). Australia and New Zealand agreed in early 2003 to extend
their dividend-imputation systems to include companies residing in the other country. Otherwise, the
withholding tax is 30% if no double-tax treaty exists (see Double-tax treaties).

Corporate taxes: Taxes on royalties and fees

Royalties are subject to withholding tax of 30% on the gross royalty. This is generally reduced to 15% if
the recipient of the royalty resides in a country with which Australia has a double-tax treaty (see
Double-tax treaties).
Royalties are defined very broadly to include fees paid for the use or supply of certain property or rights.
Royalties paid by Australian businesses are generally allowable as deductions against taxable income.
The deductibility of royalties paid by an Australian business to a non-resident related party (such as a
foreign parent company) is subject to Australia's transfer-pricing rules. States levy royalty taxes on most
mineral and onshore oil production; these payments are deductible as expenses for income-tax purposes.

Page99of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Royalty withholding tax applies to rental payments to non-residents under arrangements in which
cross-border leases are structured as hire-purchase arrangements. Typically, these involve using tax
havens and round-robin financial transactions under which it is claimed that little or no interest is subject
to interest withholding tax.

Corporate taxes: Double-tax treaties

Australia has tax treaties in force with 43 countries, and it has separate airline-profits agreements with
China, France and Italy. Australia also has an airline-profits agreement with Greece, with which it has no
double-tax treaty. It signed tax treaties in 2010 with Chile (March) and Turkey (April). The agreement with
Chile went into force in February 2013, while the treaty with Turkey entered into force in June 2013.

The treaties generally reduce withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties paid to residents of
signatory countries. All observe the principles that the country where income originates has a prior right to
charge income tax and the recipient's country of residence should allow credit for taxes already paid.

New double-tax arrangements with New Zealand came into force in March 2010; these cut the dividend
withholding rate from 15% to zero on dividends where residents of either country have holdings of 80% or
more in a company and 5% where the inter-country holdings are least 10%. The new arrangements also
provide for lower withholding tax on interest (zero or 10%, down from a flat 10%) and royalties (5%, down
from 10%).

Applies to the
unfranked portion of dividends only. Treaty allows for a
15% withholding tax on interest, but Australia levies the tax at a rate of
10%.
Rate varies with category of royalty: 10% on rents and
royalties for the use of industrial, commercial and scientific equipment; 15%
on
royalties paid by the Australian government or a public-sector body; and 20%
for
other royalties and fees during the first five years of an agreement (15%
thereafter). Rate on dividends is 15% for companies and
25% for others; 15% may apply to preferred areas of activity (not specified),
25% for other activities. All limits apply to companies
only; the limit on dividends—15% for industrial undertakings, 20% for
others—applies only if the recipient company directly owns 25% or more of
a paying company; rate on interest is 10% where the recipient is a financial
institution, and 25% otherwise.

Corporate taxes: Intercompany charges
Business expenses paid by companies operating in Australia to foreign affiliates are tax deductible,
subject to transfer-pricing provisions in Australia's tax laws. Transfer-pricing rules authorise the Australian
Taxation Office (ATO) to examine international agreements in order to verify that transactions are
conducted at arm's length and apply equally to branches and subsidiaries. The ATO may order tax
adjustments if transactions do not meet these standards.

The ATO has adopted the OECD's Transfer-Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax
Administrations. It invites multinational companies with significant international related-party dealings to
enter into advance-pricing arrangements (APAs), which set out the transfer-pricing treatment of the
taxpayer's future international related-party dealings. An APA must illustrate the application of an
approved ATO methodology to support the company's contention that the prices charged are at arm's
length.

The ATO requires Australian taxpayers to provide information in their income tax returns on the nature and
extent of cross-border transactions involving affiliated parties, to help in audit selection. Penalties for tax
avoidance through profit shifting are usually 25% of outstanding tax, falling to 10% if the company had a
reasonably arguable position and there was no tax avoidance.

Corporate taxes: Turnover, sales and excise taxes

The federal government levies a multistage, 10% goods and services tax (GST) on the value-added
component of a broad range of goods and services, and it passes the revenue on to the states.
Consumers do not pay GST on certain items (such as exports and "basic foods"), and the final vendor
may claim a GST refund from the Australian Taxation Office. Other items, such as financial services and
residential rents, are "input taxed"-that is, the consumer is not charged GST, but the vendor may not
claim a credit for GST paid on inputs. Special equalisation taxes have been introduced to make up the
difference between the GST and the previous wholesale sales tax, on goods including beer, luxury cars,
spirits, tobacco and wine.

Excise duty applies on some goods manufactured in Australia, mainly, alcohol, petroleum products and
tobacco. These may be manufactured only under a government licence. Customs duty is also imposed on
imports of these goods to ensure that they are treated consistently with locally manufactured products.

Corporate taxes: Other taxes

Governments in the states and territories have limited taxing powers since the Australian constitution does
not permit them to levy taxes on income. They can impose a payroll tax (levied at up to 7% on wages and
salaries) and a land tax. These tax payments are deductible expenses for income-tax purposes.

A carbon tax, part of Australia's carbon-pricing programme approved in November 2011, came into force
on July 1st 2012, but was repealed as of July 1st 2014.
