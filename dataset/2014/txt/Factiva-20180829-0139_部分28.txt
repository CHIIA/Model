Markets rose in Europe, the UK and US.

On the NYSE where 3224 issues traded there were 2,346 issues higher, 778 down and 100 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2701 issues traded there were 1,694 issues higher, 900 down and 107 unchanged.
Metals were higher, crude rose, gold was down a touch. The $A is at 89.60US c, down a touch on last
evening.

"Ceiling will be 5195. Floor will be 5130. Close at 5162, up 30.6 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract up 37 points. While yesterday's rally was impressive in terms of price, a
number of key tells stand out.

"Index leadership was bearish with the mid to large cap stocks leading the charge higher.

"Micro caps were actually down on the day, albeit ever so slightly.

"Sector leadership was also bearish with the inflationary and defensive issues outperforming growth
issues. And volume was not great.

"Unless the market is able to correct on the fly (that is, heal itself in terms of time rather than price), we
can expect this rally to completely give back all of its gains in due course. The only question is how high
can it run first.

"The evidence still points to the likelihood of our market challenging its 28-October-2013 high of 5457
points so I am optimistic the market can sling shot higher before a larger downturn takes hold.

"Regardless of the outcome here, the writing is on the wall for a break of the December low in due course.

"But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5195. The floor will be 5130. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5162, up 30.6 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 61.1 points to 5131.4 last evening.

February 7. Good morning.

markets are improving.

While usually the second half has been considerably better than the first half, this year there is not
