ONE of Melbourne’s largest private developers, Central Equity, has lodged plans for a soaring tower
on the same wider block that will hold Aspial’s Tower 108 in Southbank.

Central Equity hopes to build the project at 54-68 Kavanagh Street, a street where it has completed
at least three major apartment towers in the past 10 years.

The company purchased the site in May for about $27 million. Central Equity plans to build a
50-level tower that includes a nine-level podium. The tower will hold 720 apartments and is expected
to be the next cab off the Central Equity rank if it is approved by the state government.
The apartment tower will also include ground floor retail and car spaces for 417 cars and 490 “bike
parks”.
The site, about 200m from Crown casino, currently holds a low-rise office tower. Founded by
German-born Eddie Kutner and two former schoolteachers, John Bourke and Dennis Wilson, Central
Equity is one of the city’s most prolific developers with more than 70 projects completed in the past
two decades.
Last year, the company, which also sells house-and-land packages on Melbourne’s fringe, posted a
net profit after tax of $65.9m, up from $19.52m the previous year, rendering Central Equity more
profitable than any of the pure-play listed residential developers.
Like Sydney’s apartment king Harry Triguboff, the secret to Central Equity’s success has been its
strong links to China’s investment market and appeal to offshore buyers.
The company builds more than 1000 apartments a year on modest estimates. Central Equity’s
MelbourneOne tower is under construction on Lonsdale Street; the 44-level building will hold 477
apartments.

Construction at Southbank Grand is also under way, while Central Equity also recently commenced
the sales program for its Australis project on Little Lonsdale Street in the CBD.Representatives from
Central Equity did not return calls.
