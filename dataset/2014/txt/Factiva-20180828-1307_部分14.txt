SALES: Sydney Water Corporation has listed its 2ha Central Workshops site in inner Sydney
Waterloo with the sale expected to reap $80 million.
The land is in an area that has been targeted by developers including Chinese-backed JQZ and the
listed Mirvac Group, and comes as more sites across Australia hit the market.

In Melbourne, a private group is looking to sell for more than $30m an Exhibition Street building that
can sustain a 54-level tower. CBRE’s city sales team, led by Mark Wizel, is handling the offer of the
building at No 168, which changed hands last year. The buyer had planned to move in quickly but is
now looking to capitalise on the surge of capital from Singapore, Malaysia and mainland China. A
development plan by PeddleThorp has also helped drive interest.
Also in Melbourne, a private group is looking to sell 420 Spencer Street, West Melbourne. The site,
being offered by Colliers International’s Matt Stagg and Daniel Wolman, comes with approved plans
and permits for a 38-storey residential tower.In Sydney, the Central Workshops site has the potential
for 439 apartments. Stonebridge Property Group director Lincoln Blackledge is handling the sale.
