(RTTNews) - Australian telecom giant Telstra Corp. Ltd. (TLS.AX, TLSYY) on Thursday reported a 14
percent increase in profit for fiscal 2014, reflecting higher revenues and a gain on sale of the company's
Hong Kong mobile unit. In addition, the company increased its final dividend by 7 percent and
announced a share buyback of A$1 billion.
For fiscal 2014, profit attributable to equity holders of Telstra increased to A$4.28 billion from restated
A$3.74 billion in the prior year. On a per share basis, earnings grew to 34.4 Australian cents from 30.1
Australian cents last year.

The latest year's results include a gain of A$561 million on the sale of the company's 76.4 percent stake
in its Hong Kong mobile unit CSL to HKL Ltd. During the year, the company also completed the sale of a
70 percent stake in its Sensis directories business.
Sales revenue for the year grew 3 percent to A$25.12 billion from restated $24.30 billion in the previous
year.
Revenue from Telstra's fixed business decreased by 0.8 per cent overall to A$7.25 billion. However,
fixed data revenue grew by 6.3 per cent to A$2.22 billion. But more customers moving onto bundled
plans led to a 7.5 percent decrease in revenues for the company's fixed voice business to A$4.03
billion.
Mobile revenue for the year grew 5 percent from last year to A$9.67 billion. The company added
937,000 domestic mobile customers in the year, bringing its total number of mobile customers to 16
million.

Looking ahead to financial year 2015, Telstra expects continued low single-digit income and EBITDA
growth to offset the absence of CSL 2014 operating revenue and EBITDA. As a result, and after excluding
the $561 million profit on the sale of CSL in 2014, Telstra expects its income and EBITDA guidance for
2015 to be "broadly flat".

Telstra also said it has increased the final dividend by 7.1 percent to 15 Australian cents. Including the
first-half interim dividend of 14.5 Australian cents, the fully-franked dividend payment for fiscal 2014 is
29.5 Australian cents. This represents an increase from the total dividend payment of 28 Australian cents
in 2013.

The record date for the final dividend will be August 29, 2014, with payment being made on September
26.
The company also announced an off-market share buy-back of up to about A$1 billion, or $930 million,
of its own shares. The buy-back will be managed through a tender process with final tenders closing on
October 3. The company expects to release detailed process information to shareholders on August 27.
The company said that the buyback will be funded by its accumulated cash surplus and will be made up
of a capital as well as a dividend component.

Telstra said that to help improve speed and capacity for customers on the 4G network, in September we
will invest A$1.3 billion in September to secure the largest available holding of the 700MHz and 2500
MHz spectrum. The company also expect to again invest around A$1 billion in the mobile network in
fiscal year 2015.

from August 15, 2014. He will stand for election by shareholders at Telstra's next annual general meeting
in Brisbane on October 14.
Hearl, aged 63, is a former chief operating officer of global consumer group Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) and
global president of Pizza Hut. He is also a non-executive director of Goodman Fielder and Treasury Wine
Estates in Australia.

Hearl is based in Sydney and brings more than 40 years of corporate experience across industry sectors
in North America, Europe and Asia.

In Thursday's regular trading session on the Australian Securities Exchange, TLS.AX is trading at A$5.57,
up A0.12 or 2.30 percent on a volume of 40.65 million shares.
