Moody's Investors Service says Leighton Holdings Limited's (Leighton) announcement to sell its wholly
owned subsidiary John Holland is mildly credit positive for Leighton but has no immediate impact on its
Baa3/stable rating.

Leighton today announced that it has entered in to a binding agreement to sell John Holland - to CCCC
International Holding Limited (CCCI; unrated) - a Chinese based construction company - for an
enterprise valuation of about A$1.15 billion subject to certain adjustments. John Holland provides
engineering and contracting services to the infrastructure, energy and transport services sectors.

"The sale of John Holland would be credit positive for Leighton because the company will use part of the
proceeds to reduce ongoing financial leverage at a time of soft operating environment", says Maurice
O'Connell, a Moody's Vice President - Senior Credit Officer.
We expect that the sale of John Holland will result in a reduction of around 7-10% in Leighton's EBITDA.
But the impact of reduced earnings is more than offset by the planned debt reduction.

"What is critical for Leighton's ongoing credit profile is the extent to which debt reduction from the
transaction represents a strategic long-term initiative rather than a temporary one", O'Connell says,
adding "We understand that a portion of the proceeds will also be used to finance Leighton's growth".
Moody's notes the company's stated commitment to reduce its gearing and strengthen the balance sheet
as part of ensuring its ongoing competitive positioning in the market.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals.

The principal methodology used in this rating was Construction Industry published in November 2014.
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
Leighton Holdings Limited based in Sydney, Australia, is the largest construction and mining contractor in
that country and has operations in Asia and the Gulf.

This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For any credit ratings referenced in this
