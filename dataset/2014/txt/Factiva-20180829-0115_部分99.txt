Australia-listed Roc Oil said Tuesday it has farmed into a production sharing contract which covers the
D35, D21 and J4 fields offshore Malaysia.

Under the deal Roc will take a 50% participating interest in the PSC, which is currently 100% owned and
operated by Petronas Carigali, the upstream arm of Malaysia's state-owned Petronas.
Roc said it will invest an initial $25 million for the stake plus a carry with a 50% participating interest of
$80 million spread over the project's first two phases.

The farm-in agreement includes amendments to the existing PSC effective January 1, 2014 through
December 2034 which foresee a program of field redevelopment and enhanced oil recovery at the fields,
Roc said.

Phase 1 aims to enhance the fields' production potential and has a minimum work commitment of $70
million gross and an estimated total capital investment of up to $250 million gross, Roc said.

Phase 2 is subject to a field development plan decision, following the completion of a series of studies. If
approved, the second phase will incur a minimum work commitment of $50 million gross, the company
said.

D35 is the largest of the three fields with the longest production history. Roc said it "represents a
significant brownfield redevelopment project" and has further exploration potential. Roc said one well is
already under consideration for drilling in 2015.

The J4 and D21 fields are satellite producing assets which Roc said have similar potential to D35.
The three fields, which lie in water depths of some 50 meters (165 feet) produce 10,000 b/d of oil and
17,000 Mcf/day of gas, Roc said.
As a result of the deal, Roc will book proven and probable (2P) reserves of 8.7 million barrels of oil
equivalent effective January 1 this year. The extra barrels represent a 71% increase from the company's
end-2013 2P reserves of 12.2 million boe.

"We expect the fields to become cornerstone development assets within our growing regional portfolio.
The fields, particularly D35, contain material in-place oil and gas volumes, and overall field recovery is
expected to benefit significantly from the introduction of secondary and tertiary recovery technologies,"
Roc CEO Alan Linn said.
Roc said its experience in the redevelopment of the Zhao Dong fields in China's Bohai Bay was a good
analogy for the redevelopment potential of the three Malaysian fields. Roc has doubled Zhao Dong's
recoverable reserves since 2006. Roc also has a stake in the Balai oil field offshore Sarawak in eastern
Malaysia through BC Petroleum, a partnership with Petronas Carigali and Dialog D&P. The field started
production late last year.
