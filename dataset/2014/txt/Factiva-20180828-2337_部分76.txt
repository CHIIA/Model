IRONCLAD Mining has been unable to raise finance for its iron ore export project on Eyre Peninsula
and will instead focus on selling ore to Arrium.
The company said despite receiving all of its major approvals last October, “financing of the $23
million capital required for stage one commencement has proved difficult to achieve in the current low
iron ore price climate.’’ IronClad tried to raise the money via debt rather than equity but despite some
interest from trading houses and non-bank lenders, this was not successful.

“The rapid cyclical decline in Chinese ore prices since the beginning of this year has caused most third
parties to place these discussions on hold,” chairman Ian Finch said in a statement.
“An approach was made to Arrium – with a view to IronClad negotiating a ‘mine gate’ sale of its ore to
the exporter. Arrium have been receptive to the concept and discussions are ongoing.’’ It was not
spelled out in the ASX release how much such an operation would cost and management was not
available to comment.IronClad shares closed steady on 7.5c.
