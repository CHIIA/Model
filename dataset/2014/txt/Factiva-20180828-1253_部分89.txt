The firm has offered A$3.4bn for Australia’s TreasuryWine as it recruits a Korea deal maker in Hong
Kong

TPG Capital has emerged as a competitor in the buyout of Australian wine businessTreasury Wine
Estates in a deal worth as much as A$3.4 billion ($3.15 billion; €2.35 billion), rivaling the bid from
global private equity firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts.
Treasury Wine confirmed the receipt of a proposal from a global private equity firm of A$5.20 in cash
per share – the same amount KKR and co-investor Rhône Capital bid earlier this month.
Although it did not name the bidder, media has widely reported TPG as the unnamed private equity
firm.
KKR and Rhône had previously offered A$3.1 billion for the business in April, although the proposal
was rejected on the grounds that the board felt it didn’t reflect the proper value of the company.

Satisfied with the raised bid last week, Treasury Wines said it would engage with KKR and Rhône on a
non-exclusive basis, allowing the firms to carry out due diligence.
Treasury Wine is now talking to both private equity bidders, stating there is no certainty that either
proposal will result in a formal offer.
“As previously stated, if an offer does result, the board will assess whether it delivers a value
proposition that is superior to the expected benefits from management’s renewed strategic plans,” a
Treasury Wine statement said.
Its plans include increasing consumer marketing investment in the company’s brands, continuing to
drive efficiencies and improve the cost base, and addressing structural opportunities by focusing on
commercial brands separately from its luxury portfolio in Australia.
TPG declined to comment on the matter, but it comes as the firm ramps up its activity in Asia Pacific
markets, having having closed its sixth Asia-focused vehicle on $3.3 billion in May this year after a
difficult two-year fundraising period.
The firm is also this month adding Seung-june Lee to its Hong Kong office as a principal to focus on
investments in South Korea, a source close to the matter confirmed to Private Equity International.
Lee joins from Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, where he also focused on Korea – a relatively quiet
market for TPG in recent years.  
Lee’s appointment is one of many recent team changes at TPG in Asia – the firm’s fundraising process
rapidly improving after it restructured its Asia Pacific team earlier this year.
In January, senior partner Tim Dattels relocated from the TPG San Francisco headquarters to Hong
Kong to become co-head of Asia. He joined Ben Gray as co-head, who is based in Singapore and also
serves as managing partner in Korea, Japan, Australia and Southeast Asia.

director at Khazanah Nasional Berhad, to its Southeast Asia investments team.
TPG has also strengthened its China ties this month, receiving a $250 million investment into its
management company from China Life Insurance, one of the world’s largest insurers, PEI reported last
week. The partnership will allow both parties to access each other’s networks in China and offshore,
creating opportunities both ways, one source said.
