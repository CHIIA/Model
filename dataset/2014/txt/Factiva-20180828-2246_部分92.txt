The sharemarket closed lower yesterday as mining stocks fell after the iron ore price reached a near
five-year low and on expectations the Abbott government will make downward revisions to its
Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, to be released on Monday.

At the close, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was down 11.4 points, or 0.22 per cent, at 5219.6
points, while the broader All Ordinaries index had slipped 10.5 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5196.9.

Both indices finished down 2.2 per cent for the week.

The dollar hit a new 4½-year low after the Reserve Bank governor said he wanted the currency to
continue to fall in the new year.

At the close, the unit was trading at US82.72c, down from US83.29c on Thursday. The dollar touched
a low of US82.15c early yesterday, its lowest point since June 2010, after Glenn Stevens said he
wanted it to go as low as US75c. The currency recovered as the day progressed, as the market also
digested his comments hosing down speculation of rate cuts in 2015, and an expectation of
improvements in the economy.
The benchmark iron ore for immediate delivery to the port of Tianjin in China was trading at
$US68.80 a tonne, down 0.1 per cent from its previous close of $US68.90 a tonne and scarcely above
the five-year low of $US68.

CMC Markets chief market analyst Ric Spooner said the day was relatively steady, although mixed
performances in the US market set a subdued tone for local investors.
Signs of bargain hunting had emerged in the energy sector, Mr Spooner said, affecting stocks such
as Woodside Petroleum and Origin Energy.

“Overall, the tone of the market remains relatively nervous, and the sources of that nervousness
include the quite significant declines we’re seeing in commodity prices, including oil in recent weeks,”
he said.
The price of oil fell below $US60 for the first time since July 2009. The energy sector lifted 1.58 per
cent. Santos was one of the strong performers, trading 2.29 per cent higher at $7.16. Woodside
Petroleum firmed 1.2 per cent to $34.60 and Origin Energy gained 3.31 per cent to $10.91.
A falling iron ore price continued to weigh on materials, which gave up 1.42 per cent as a sector.

BHP Billiton retreated 1.86 per cent to $28.46, while Rio Tinto lost 2.49 per cent to $53.67.

Financial stocks slipped slightly, with all banks in the red and the sector down 0.09 per cent.

ANZ lost 0.67 per cent to $31.00, while Commonwealth Bank inched 0.55 per cent lower to $81.74.

$32.05.

Consumer staples lost 0.33 per cent. Woolworths lost 0.43 per cent to $29.86, while Wesfarmers
dropped 0.43 per cent to $41.42.
Leighton Holdings gave up 0.65 per cent to $21.56 off the back of the sale of its John Holland
construction business to China Communication Construction for $1.15 billion.

Meanwhile, Telstra inched up 0.18 per cent to $5.70 and Qantas lost 1.64 per cent to $2.40.business
