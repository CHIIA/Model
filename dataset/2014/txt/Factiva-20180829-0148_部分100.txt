19 Jan 2014 18:09 EDT Paladin Sells 25% of Namibia Mine to Chinese Nuclear Giant

By David Winning

SYDNEY--Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN.AU) said it had agreed to sell a 25% stake in its Langer Heinrich
uranium mine in Namibia to a unit of state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. for US$190 million.

The deal gives Paladin a much-needed cash injection after a prolonged period of losses incurred
largely as a result of a sharp fall in uranium prices since an earthquake triggered an atomic crisis in
Japan in early 2011.
Paladin said the deal with the CNNC unit, known as China Uranium Corp. Ltd., still required approval
from Chinese regulators, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's
economic planner.
