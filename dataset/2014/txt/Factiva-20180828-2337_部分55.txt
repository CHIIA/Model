A NATIONAL Party MP has been accused of forging the letterhead of a real estate agent so he
could wrongly claim hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales commissions.

Former real estate agent and current member for Murray Valley, Tim McCurdy, is being sued for
$375,741 from the sale of two northern Victorian farms to Chinese interests in 2009.

In a writ lodged with the County Court, PGW Agriservices has accused Mr McCurdy of “engaging in
misleading and deceptive conduct” and unconscionable conduct in contravention of the Fair Trading
Act.

Victoria Police is also looking into the matter to determine whether any criminal offence has
occurred.
The statement of claim, seen by the Herald Sun, alleges a 581ha dairy property in Boosey, about
50km north of Shepparton, was sold to overseas buyer Xing Long in July 2009.
The property, known as Malmo, was sold for about $7.8 million, including a commission of
$245,850.
A second property in Katamatite, Pinegrove, sold for $3.9 million to the same buyer in December
that year with a $129,891 commission.
Mr McCurdy was not entitled to complete either sale or claim the commission as he no longer
worked for the real estate company who had initially negotiated the deals, the writ claimed.

It also alleged he stole documents from his former employer and broke an agreement not to carry on
a real estate business within 100km of a Cobram business he had sold to the plaintiff.
The Nationals MP worked for PGG Wrightson from June 2008 until February 2009. The company
alleges that before Mr McCurdy left, he told a manager the two sales had “fallen over” and “were not
proceeding due to the lack of finance”.

National Party spokesman Les White denied any wrongdoing by Mr McCurdy. “Mr McCurdy used
the letterhead with the knowledge and consent of its owner, and this is what he will establish if the
case proceeds,” Mr White said.michelle.ainsworth@news.com.au
