0858 GMT [Dow Jones] Palladium prices have come off highs this week amid hopes of an end to a
nearly five-month-long miners strike in South Africa, but the deal is far from concluded. "It does seem
that real progress has been made, but it is worth stressing no agreement has been signed yet and there
remain some potential stumbling blocks," says a report by Macquarie Research. Mining companies and
union officials in South Africa tentatively agreed on a proposal Thursday to end the strike that has
disrupted production of both palladium and platinum. Though broad consent has been reached, a wage
agreement with workers is not yet universal, adds Macquarie. Spot palladium prices are marginally up at
$822.75 an ounce. (biman.mukherji@wsj.com)

0852 GMT [Dow Jones] RBS recommends investors stay long SEK rates as the market is still some 20
basis points shy of discounting a policy rate of 0.25% later this year. Swedish inflation data this week
confirmed the disinflationary trend, where a 25 basis point rate cut in July is "now a done deal," says
RBS. However, RBS doesn't think that the Riksbank will stop there. "Rather, we see the policy rate being
cut all the way to 0.25% before the end of the year, and we do not exclude the possibility of a Swedish
QE after that." RBS adds it favors five-year Swedish bonds versus 5-year Euro and UK peers.

0846 GMT [Dow Jones] The U.S. bank's rate strategists expect a strong rise in U.S. yield's by year end,
which they say will lead to higher global funding costs and is a major risk to the current low-volatility
environment. A yield-driven rise in volatility will likely see portfolios being adjusted to reflect this changing
risk environment, which the bank says would suggest USD and JPY strength. Combine this scenario with
the disinflationary/deflationary theme developing in Europe (UK not included here) where central banks
will maintain extremely loose policy and the likes of SEK, EUR and CHF are looking extremely
vulnerable. To position for this the bank adds a basket of short SEK, EUR and CHF vs long USD and
JPY to its medium-term strategic portfolio. (gary.stride@wsj.com)

0846 GMT [Dow Jones]-- The Bank of England looks most likely to raise interest rates in November,
Derek Halpenny, European head of currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ says. "The
comment from Governor Carney last night that a rate increase "could happen sooner than markets
currently expect" was as direct as you can get, and, given that the markets were already mostly priced
for a first quarter of 2015 first rate increase, the likely consequence of this comment is that expectations
of a fourth quarter 2014 will now increase notably," he writes, adding that "a November rate hike now
seems the most plausible scenario". (josie.cox@wsj.com)

0843 GMT [Dow Jones]--Selling 5yr sterling versus 5yr euros looks more attractive after BOE Governor
Mark Carney said Thursday that UK rates might rise sooner than market expects. "He also said that rises
will be gradual, and data-dependent, but the qualifications won't matter to a market which prices a slow
pace of rises, starting next year," says Kit Juckes at Societe Generale. While GBP/USD is approaching
1.70, he things this will be the top level to be tested. "EUR/GBP has broken through 0.80 and looking at
how EUR/GBP and GBP/USD trade relative to rate differentials, EUR/GBP shorts are the more

Page30of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.appealing trade. And the contrast between ECB and MPC is incredibly striking," he adds.

0834 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are mostly steady after a new 10-year bond auction,
says a local trader. The cut-off yield of the NT$40 billion 10-year bond comes at 1.5530%, within market
expectations of between 1.5300% and 1.5700%. But the trader says total bids at the auction decrease
while local brokerages turn more conservative in bidding for the new bond, suggesting weaker investor
sentiment in the near term. Local bonds are expected to track U.S. Treasurys ahead of the FOMC
meeting next week, he adds. The most-traded 10-year bond yield is unchanged at 1.5520% from
Thursday; the trader tips the yield to consolidate between 1.5300% and 1.5700% on Monday.

0827 GMT [Dow Jones] As the markets slow during the World Cup season, analysts turn themselves into
football pundits making calls on who will win the tournament. Goldman Sachs said the host and top
favorite Brazil will be the champion for the sixth time while Deutsche Bank said underdog England will lift
the trophy again after winning it 48 years ago in its homeland. Macquarie chooses the middle road and
predicts three-time champion Germany as the winner, with reigning champion Spain as the runner-up;
"Macquarie Quant has a strong tradition of extending our quantitative skills into sport," it says. And their
choices aren't too far away from those of football experts - Germany and Spain are strongly endorsed by
the legendary footballer Pele. (jacky.wong@wsj.com; Twitter: @jackycwong)
0824 GMT [Dow Jones] HKT Trust (6823.HK), a subsidiary of Hong Kong fixed-line telecom
companyPCCW Ltd, closed down 4.3% at HK$8.25 after it announced plans to raise about HK$7.9
billion (US$1 billion) in a rights issue to pay down its own debt. Macquarie says it expects the net
proceeds will be applied to reduce the existing indebtedness of the company, post its recent
acquisition of CSL Ltd. HKT Trust bought out Hong Kong mobile phone operator CSL (CSL.AU) from
Australia's Telstra Corp in a $2.43 billion deal in May. "We believe the latest announced right issue
should remove the overhang related to financing of the CSL acquisition," says Macquarie. The house
estimates the maximum EPS dilution from the right issue exercise is around 15%. (yvonne.lee@wsj.com)
0823 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities touch their highest level all year as the soaring price of oil
boosts energy stocks and better-than-expected retail sales lift mall owners. The Hang Seng Index closes
up 0.6% at 23319.17 Friday, ending the week up 1.6% and just 20 points below the benchmark's
six-month high. Energy firms lead gains as violence in Iraq sends Brent crude futures to a nine-month
high of US$114.07 per barrel. China's retail sales data for May -- "with a positive surprise for a change"
in Nordea's view -- prompts a rally in Hong Kong-listed mall owners. Wharf Holdings rises 3.1% to
HK$57.55, the biggest intraday gain in a month. Enough traders crawl into the office to boost volumes to
HK$50.7 billion, the highest in three days - even after a 4 a.m. kick-off for those watching Brazil's 3-1
victory over Croatia. (gregor.hunter@wsj.com; Twitter: @gregorhunter)

0823 GMT [Dow Jones] The overnight surge higher in GBP/USD was lacking in volume says the UK
clearer, which for now is taking a cautiously bullish approach. The bank's immediate focus is on the
psychological 1.70 print, and then the 2009 peak of 1.7045, only a daily close above the latter on strong
volumes would suggest gains toward 1.73 will be seen. Now at 1.6980, Barclays pegs support at 1.6920.
(gary.stride@wsj.com)

0822 GMT [Dow Jones]--During a speech Thursday evening, BOE Governor Mark Carney said UK rates
could be hiked sooner than exepcted. But "how soon is 'sooner' remains to be seen," says Geoffrey Yu
at UBS. "At present markets are still expecting a move around Q2 next year, with exact timing also
originally somewhat complicated by the political calendar," he says. A rate hike 'sooner' than this
expectation would allow the BOE to steer well clear of the electoral cycle. On the macroeconomic front,
Mr. Yu adds, it is also possible that upcoming BOE reviews will herald a change in either the bank's view
on economic slack, or the speed at which it is being closed. (chiara.albanese@wsj.com

0820 GMT ("Dutch Retail Sales Signal Recovery -- Market Talk," at 0757 GMT, incorrectly said that April
retail sales rose for the 4th straight month. The correct version follows:) Dutch retail sales rose in April by
3.4%, marking the highest increase since November 2010, according to statistics bureau CBS. The
figures, fueled by strong Easter sales, suggest that Dutch households are slowly becoming more positive
after years of falling house prices and government austerity. (maarten.vantartwijk@wsj.com)
