Approximately USD500 million in debt securities affected

Moody's Investors Service has placed the Baa2 issuer rating of Leighton Holdings Limited ("Leighton")
and the senior unsecured rating of Leighton Finance (USA) Pty Ltd on review for downgrade.

TD

The action follows today's announcement by Leighton's majority shareholder, HOCHTIEF
Aktiengesellschaft ("Hochtief") that it intends to increase its stake in Leighton from 58.8% to a maximum
of 74.23% for a total cash consideration of approximately AUD1.15 billion. At the same time Hochtief
announced its intention to increase its representation on the Leighton Board to reflect its majority interest
in Leighton.

RATINGS RATIONALE

"The review reflects the uncertainty regarding the future financial and business profile of Leighton, should
the proposal proceed as announced", says Maurice O'Connell, a Moody's Vice President and Senior
Analyst, adding "The review also considers Moody's view that Hochtief and its majority owner Actividades
de Construccion Servicios SA's (ACS; unrated) have lower credit quality than Leighton".

"We have previously highlighted that Leighton's rating would be pressured if Hochtief seeks to appoint a
majority of the directors on Leighton's board", O'Connell adds.

The review will focus on 1) the business strategy and financial policy that Leighton will pursue if the
transaction proceeds as planned, including ongoing dividend policy, 2) Leighton's liquidity and funding
policy arising from this transaction, 3) impact on Leighton's current and ongoing contractual
arrangements.

The principal methodology used in these ratings was the Global Construction Methodology published in
November 2010. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

Headquartered in Sydney, Australia, Leighton Holdings Limited (Leighton) is the largest construction and
mining contractor in Australia, operating principally through three independent contracting subsidiaries:
John Holland, Thiess, and Leighton Contractors as well as Leighton Properties as a property developer.
The company also has significant activities in Asia, principally in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macau,
Mongolia and India and owns a 45% stake in major UAE based builder Habtoor Leighton Group.
