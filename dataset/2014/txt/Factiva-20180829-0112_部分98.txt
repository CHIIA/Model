MARKET PLUNGES IN AVRO, CLOSES ON ITS LOWS

*There were no gainers and only Telstra was steady (supported by bullish newspaper reports on how
much NBN owed it) among the Top 20.

Our market weakened sharply in the afternoon, closing down 69.7 points to 5358.9 on average volume
worth $3.9 billion - with volume also picking up sharply in the afternoon.

Best guess is with the market falling below the uptrend line, stop losses were triggered and technical
trading dominated. The $A is steady at 93.95US c.

Meanwhile, although not reflected in afternoon trading (a further possible indication that technical traders
were dominating the market) China's purchase of the Las Bambas copper mine in Peru for $6 billion -
the price GlencoreXstrata paid for Chinese approval of their merger - announced earlier today - plus an
agreement to supply a minimum amount of copper to China for 8 years is very likely to be a negative for
our copper miners.
However, copper miners closed higher - OZ Minerals rose 11c to $3.75 on 1.9m shares, CuDeco rose
8.5c to $1.91 on 400,000 shares.

*Western Areas is up 20c to $3.96 on 4m shares, Mincor rose 6c to 86c on 930,414 shares on a sharp
rise in the nickel price last Friday.
*Alumina rose 2c to $1.33 on 14.18m shares.

It was the banks that led the market lower, contributing 23.7 negative points to the index while resources
contributed 4.9 negative points although the $A was steady.

*QBE fell 46c to $11.98 on 4.9m shares after confirming it is having a strategic review of its US assets -
not viewed positively by analysts.
*Coca-Cola Amatil fell 68c to $9.06 on 15.1 m shares - on its latest downgrade and may not be regarded
as a 'safe sector stock" at least for awhile.
*Meanwhile coal is now so sharply seen as a negative in the fight against rising CO2 at some stage it is
likely to begin to affect coal valuations for Australian coal companies.
BHP and RIO have both copper and coal assets.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures is down 80 points to 13,980 points, Shanghai CSI physical is down
4.07 points to 2126.47, Hang Seng futures is up 52 points to 23,047 points. S&P futures is down 2.5
points to 1809.20, Nasdaq futures is down 3 points to 3441 points. Dow futures is down 22 points to5,959
after being down 120 points at midday, our time.
Gold futures are up $7.60 to 41326.60. Crude futures have gained 50c to $104.24.
