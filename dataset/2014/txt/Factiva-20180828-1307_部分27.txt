Our market seems to have risen off its early lows on bargain hunting ahead of the profit reporting season,
with no real news to push it either way.

"High will be 5520. Low will be 5470.. close at 5491, down 27.6 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract pointing down 31 points.

"While I inferred yesterday that the move higher in US equities was just a bounce, I was still surprised that
most of the US marquee indices were able to print lower lows so soon. Whether they are headed
immediately lower or whether we will first see some more digestion of the prior losses, I am not sure.

"It was interesting that the small cap Russell 2000 managed to hold its respective low. Just a blip or a sign
that demand is starting to pick up again - we will find out soon enough.

"I believe enough technical damage has been done to inflict further losses on equities in the very near
term. As to whether the final top is in or not, the jury is still out deliberating on that front.

"None of this matters for today. The high will be 5520. The low will be 5470. When the dust has settled,
the market will have closed at 5491, down 27.6 points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 22.3 points to 5518.6 last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY

Mineralogy ordered to pay Citic Pacific's indemnity costs

"The Australian" reports a West Australian Supreme Court judge has launched an unusually blunt attack
on Clive Palmer’s mining vehicle Mineralogy, describing its legal tactics as “unreasonable”, “absurd” and
“a moveable feast” as he made a rare order for the company to pay indemnity costs.

In a scathing decision published today, Justice James Edelman ordered Mineralogy to pay the “not
insignificant” costs of its estranged business partner, Chinese companyCitic Pacific, over a legal claim it
launched late last year but abandoned after just four months.

The so-called frustration claim was made as part of Mr Palmer’s wider legal battle with Citic Pacific over
the $10 billion Sino Iron project in the Pilbara.

Changes in substantials reported August 4 and 5 inc posted separately.

*LEP: Stat profit up 149.5%, final distrib 8.25c, rec date Jun 30/outlook positive
ALE Property Group for the year ended June 30 announced a statutory profit up 149.5% to $37.194
million on total revenue up 0.9% to $56.403 million.

Profit before income tax attributable to stapled security holders before net gain from fair value adjustments
of investment properties and derivatives, amortisation of borrowing costs and other non cash expenses
was down 1.5% to $31.232 million.

Net assets per security are $1.93 vs $1.90 last year.

Total revenue was up 0.9% as a result of lower interest income offset by higher rental income. Rent
received from properties was up 2.05%. Interest income decreased due to lower funds on deposit and
lower interest rates.
Other income increased by $24.8957 million to $40.68 million due mainly to increases in fair value
increments to properties in the current year.

The final distribution is 8.25c, record date was June 30. The full year distribution of 16.45c is expected to
be 96.43% tax deferred.
Chairman Peter Warne said in the report the pubs enjoyed a healthy increase in value and the group
locked in lower credit margins and base interest rates during the year.

2015 guidance

At least 16.45c plus CPI to be paid in distribution.
$335 million AMTN refinancing ensures capital position remains strong. Maturity dates are now
diversified over the next 3, 6 and 9 years. The lower base interest rates are fixed and hedging simplified
for 8.8 years.

Savings from all up interest rate of 4.35% p.a. is fixed until 2018.

Analysts expectations: $34 mln.
A leading broker on July 21 had a "lighten" on ALE Property Group with a price target of $2.71, up from
$2.51 earlier.
The broker said ALE Property Group has substantially improved its debt structure over the past couple of
months .. we still like ALE Property's long dated, trile net leases to Woolworths, its under-rented portfolio
and the strength of its management team, but we see better value elsewhere in the property sector.

regarding Woolworths pub portfolio, the broker said, "The AFR and The Australian have both reported that
ALE Property is in the running to buyWoolworths leased pubs. Based on prior statements of its
acquisition strategy, we think ALE Property would be interested in these assets, but only at the "right

Page54of417©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.price". Its cost of capital is competitive, but with real estate capital markets being dominated by asset
hungry pension and sovereign wealth funds, we think it is more likely that ALE Property will be unwilling
to pay the capitalisation rate needed to secure the assets'.

*ORI: To retain Mining Services, spin off/sell Chemicals business
Orica Ltd announced it has completed a strategic review of its Chemicals business. As a result the board
intends to pursue the separation of the chemicals businesses either by demerger or sale.
Orica's two businesses Mining Services and Chemicals are both market leaders in their respective
industries.
A separation of the businesses would allow Orica to focus on its core Mining Services activities and
capitalise on its global leadership positions in commercial explosives, ground support and sodium
cyanide.
Orica Chemicals is a leading supplier of chemical products to the mining, water treatment and other
industrial, food and cosmetics markets in Australia and New Zealand and with a growing presence in Asia
and Latin America. The annual revenue is approximately $1.2 billion. A demerger would create a
separate ASX listing for the Chemicals business.

Whilst demerger is currently the preferred approach, Orica will consider any alternatives that are in the
interests of shareholders. A further update will be provided at the full year results announcement on
November 19.

BluGlass Ltd advised the loss for the financial year is likely to be in the order of $2.8/3.1 million vs $1.67
million operating loss last year.

The increase in operating loss for the 2014 financial year is primarily a result of the recognition, as sundry
income, of one tax research and development rebate in the 2014 financial year as compared to the
recognition of two years of R&D tax rebates in the 2013 financial year.
The company has received advice that the potential R&D tax rebate for the 2014 financial year is likely to
be in the vicinity of $2/2.25 million vs $4.2 million recognised as tax rebates in the 2013 financial year.
The tax rebate for the 2014 financial year of between $2/2.25m is likely to be received as cash in
