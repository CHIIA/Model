This report aims to compare and contrast 21 listed graphite plays (13 ASX, seven TSX and one AIM) and
shed some light on important factors to consider when assessing graphite (and indeed other industrial
mineral) projects1. Andrew Scogings, IM Consultant, and Jason Chesters, Resource Analyst at Patersons
Securities, look into the listed companies using parameters set out by Patersons in August. The project list
is by no means exhaustive, and should be seen as a general perspective on the current state of play.

The graphite sector remains highly topical and the share prices of most of the listed stocks continue to
react positively, although they are well off the highs seen a few months ago. This is illustrated by the graph
in Figure 1, which compares the price performance of the ASX-listed graphite sector relative to the ASX300
Resources index over the past 12 months.

Speculation over the impact of Tesla Motors’ planned ‘Gigafactory’, announcements by Dongfeng on their
electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) expansion ambitions, production closures and export
taxes implemented in China, coupled with continued talk of M&A interest and the potential growth in
applications for graphene serves to maintain interest in the sector.

There exists a growing window of opportunity for new supply to enter the market. That said, the extent of
new discoveries and planned production globally is well in excess of this opportunity and it is looking
increasingly likely that many projects will fail to reach production.

Many graphite explorers seem to be fixated on ‘biggest is best’ and, although resource tonnes and graphitic
carbon content (grade) are key metrics in evaluating mining projects, the evaluation of graphite projects is
more complex. Out of the myriad considerations, key attributes (in addition to size of deposit and grade)
are flake size distribution, purity of the graphite and the extent to which the company has signed binding
sales agreements.

With regard to graphite flake size and purity, attention is drawn to JORC 2012 (Clause 49), which requires
that industrial mineral resources or reserves must be reported in terms of mineral specifications.
Furthermore, according to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum guide to Best
Practice (CIM 2003), “Market considerations incorporate not only the requirement for detailed market
analyses and/or contracts of sale, but also recognition that markets for many industrial minerals are
relatively small, may have a high degree of producer concentration, or may have very high technical
barriers to entry, thus imposing limits or constraints on achievable market volumes.”

Bearing the above in mind, we have compiled a quantitative matrix of six key factors that we consider
important in ranking graphite plays in the current market. These are i) deposit size, contained graphite and
enterprise value; ii) location (country risk); iii) flake size distribution; iv) product purity; v) product off take
agreements and vi) timeframe to production (Tables 1, 2 and 3).

4) product purity; 5) product off take agreements and 6) timeframe to production

Each factor receives a maximum score of 10 points and we equally weight each compiled factor. This
results in a maximum score for each listed stock under consideration out of 60. Naturally, earlier stage
explorers may be detrimentally impacted by some of the quantitative factors (e.g., resource not yet
estimated; no metallurgical results), however this partially compensates for some of the increased risk
associated with the stage of development and illustrates the dynamics of the graphite space.

At this juncture, it should be noted that the graphite market is dynamic and that project rankings could be
impacted in a number of ways, including:

• Changes in the political landscape of the region where the project is located;

• Fluctuating commodity prices, which could be exacerbated by foreign exchange variations;

• Non-availablity of funding for exploration and development, or funding at a premium;
• An economic deposit (ore reserve) may or may not be delineated, especially when flake size, purity and
processing characteristics are taken into account;

• The lab or pilot process test methods may or may not not scale up to successful production and meet
anticipated yields, flake size distribution or product purity.

Page143of244©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The three highest ranked ASX graphite projects based on updated quantitative analysis continue to be
those held by Syrah Resources (SYR), Valence Industries (VXL) and Kibaran Resources (KNL) as
previously reported in July 2014 (Tables 1 and 2). The three most interesting TSX graphite projects are
owned by Flinders (FDR) Focus Graphite (FMS) and Northern Graphite (NGC), while AIM-listed StratMin
Global Resources (STGR) looks equally attractive with its Loharano project (Table 3).

However, given the recent spate of exploration updates, results and resource upgrades released to the
markets since 20 July, e.g., Archer Exploration (AXE), Buxton Resources (BUX), Lamboo Resources
(LMB), Kibaran Resources (KNL), Triton Minerals (TON) and Uranex (UNX), now known as Magnis (MNS)
it is possible that the rankings will change as projects evolve.

Factor 1 - Deposit size and quality

The first factor scores the size (20%) and grade (30%) of the deposit as well as the Enterprise Value per
tonne (EV/t) of contained graphite (50%). This factor encompasses the traditional size and grade metrics of
a ‘normal’ (non-industrial mineral) deposit (where bigger and higher is better) and adds an element of
valuation to the mix with the EV/t metric. The size (tonnage) is given the lowest weighting of the three
parameters, as this is considered to be less important than grade and that a resource of >20m tonnes is
relatively academic given the present size of the global graphite market.

Syrah, Triton and Mason score the highest (10) on this factor, mainly as a result of significant size and/or
grade of resource and commensurately a low EV/t, while Sovereign and Energizer (9) and Kibaran (8), also
score well. The lowest scoring stocks are Lamboo and Magnis (2) (in the case of Magnis this is as a result
of not having scores for size or EV/t, although we have assigned a value based on exploration target
grades of 4-9%C at Nachu.). Figures 2-5 below show the results of this comparison. Figure 2 and 3 show
bubble charts comparing deposit grade, size of deposit (in contained graphite) and enterprise value. As a
result of the current size of the Syrah and Triton resources and the distortion that creates, we have
excluded these companies from Figure 3.

Triton

Triton

Factor 2 - Location
The second factor scores the risk of project location using the Fraser Institute Annual Survey of Mining
Companies 2013 (Policy Perception Index), supplemented with a subjective score for non-ranked
countries. Country risk is often underestimated until the risk is realised, often with significant consequences
for investors.

The top scoring stocks in this factor are Talga and Flinders (10), with deposits in Sweden (currently the top
ranked country in the world according to the survey), while Lamboo and Buxton (9) scored well with their
projects in Western Australia. Canadian and South Australian plays ranked fairly highly, well ahead of poor
performers

with projects in Africa, Madagascar and Sri Lanka.

Factor 3 - Flake size distribution

The third factor scores the flake distribution (relevant only in flake graphite deposits as opposed to
amorphous deposits) or suitability, of the graphite produced to be used in higher value applications. This is
one of the more debated project factors as some stress its importance, while others play it down (usually
those that do not have high proportions of larger flakes in their deposit).

However, a number of facts about flake size are true. Firstly, the larger the flake (in a given deposit) the
higher the purity of the graphite and the higher the price (all else being equal). In addition, as certain end
use applications require certain minimum specifications of graphite, the demand profile for different flake
sizes (among other factors) is a key driver in project decisions. For that reason, projects with particularly

Page144of244©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.large proportions of ultrafine flake graphite may not proceed into development as this is the segment of the
market most at risk of over supply.

Flake size is one of the more difficult factors to rank, given that not all explorers report comparable size
fractions and also that many explorers have not progressed to the stage of detailed metallurgical testwork.

Figure 6 shows the flake size distribution based on our interpretation of information currently available.
Magnis, Northern and StratMin score the highest on this factor (10), slightly ahead of Kibaran, Alabama
and Focus (8) owing to their greater proportions of larger flake sizes relative to ultrafine graphite. Although
Buxton reports coarse flake size based on petrographic evidence, this is insufficient to score this project.
The two Tanzanian projects (Kibaran and Magnis) score higher than the two Mozambique plays (Syrah and
Triton), suggesting an underlying difference in geological conditions. This may be related to original host
rock composition and/or metamorphic grade. Archer has two projects: Campoona (fine flake less than 75
micron) and Wilco (medium to large flake). The current Archer score is based on a weighted value for the
two projects; naturally this would change if based solely on Wilclo.

Talga has two projects, Nunasvaara and Raitajärvi, of which Nunasvaara has, to date, been the
company’s main project. However, Raitajärvi is predominantly medium-to extra-large flake, hence this
could change the Talga score as the projects progress.

It is also worth noting that Valence, which according to its market release dated 9 October 2014, has
reportedly discovered material containing some of the largest flake sizes ever discovered (flake graphite
exceeding 4 millimetres). The significance of this discovery to its Uley graphite project is still being
quantified and therefore is not included in this analysis.

Factor 4 - Product purity

The fourth factor scores the purity of the graphite after simple processing (ie., before acid or thermal
upgrading). As with flake size, product purity is difficult to ascertain from public reports and we also draw
attention to the potential dificulty of predicting the effect of scaling up from lab and trial testing to full-scale
plant production.

Graphite purity is particularly important for the higher value end uses like lithium-ion batteries and is a key
determinant in saleability of the product. It is also a key factor in the cost of production, as if further
processing is required to make the product saleable, this could dramatically increase the operating cost.
There is also an environmental consideration in whether acid leaching or thermal treatment is required in
the product beneficiation and whether this may impact the attractiveness of the product for certain end use
applications (eco-friendly applications may be particular about how the feedstock was produced).

Simple processing can be altered in certain cases by including further grinding and flotation to produce a
purer concentrate (to a point), however this does decrease the proportion of larger flake sizes in the final
concentrate and increase the cost of production. Some deposits such as Loharano (StratMin), Epanko
(Kibaran), Duwi Soveriegn and Coosa (Alabama) are deeply weathered; for example, Epanko, to 80 metres
depth. Weathering causes oxidation and hydration, which softens the rock and breaks down gangue
minerals such as entrained carbonates, sulphides and silicates; this may enhance flake liberation and
hence purity.

Figure 7 shows the purity of the product after simple processing. Zenyatta (10) scores highest on this
metric followed by Syrah, Triton, Alabama and Focus (8), while Lamboo, Talga and Flinders have the
lowest scores (2). The high purity seen at the Zenyatta Albany project is probably related to the
hydrothermal mineralisation style. Buxton could not be ranked as no metallurgical testwork has been done.

Although not included in Figure 7 the vein graphite projects in Sri Lanka (MRL Corp and Bora Bora) often
have such high %C grades to start with, that simple sorting and processing is all that is required to produce
a very high purity product.

Factor 5 - Product offtake

Given that an industrial mineral deposit without a market is merely a geological curiosity, the fifth factor
scores the company’s success in signing binding offtake agreements and memoranda of understanding
(MoU) for substantial portions of intended production.

Page145of244©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The graphite market is largely one of contracted sales agreements between buyers and sellers for product
meeting the buyer’s specific requirements. For this reason, a formal sales agreement with buyers for a
substantial portion of the intended production is of particular importance (there have been cases of
companies being forced to close because they could not sell a large enough portion of product produced).
We have given greater weight in our scoring to binding off take agreements as opposed to MoU and have
rewarded greater proportions of production covered by such agreements (although any agreement is better
than none at all).

On this factor StratMin (10) and Lamboo (8) score the highest, followed by Kibaran and Focus (6).
Figure 6: Flake size distribution

Figure 7: Purity of concentrate

Factor 6 - Timeframe to production

The sixth factor scores the expected time to commercial production.
The interest in securing ex-China sources of supply coupled with Chinese closures and the growth in
higher specification product demand has resulted in a window of opportunity to introduce new supply to the
market. The race to bring the right product to the market and secure those sought-after offtake agreements
means that those companies further advanced in their timeline to first commercial production have an
advantage over those further behind (on the assumption that they have the required product
specifications).

This factor scores Valence, Flinders and StratMin the highest (10) as they are either operational, or very
shortly expected to be in commercial production. It is worth noting that Valence and Flinders are brownfield
projects with a record of previous production, which is likely to shorten time to production. StratMin was
also previously mined on a small scale prior to 1947, while the Alabama Coosa project was mined until the
1950s, which should assist timeframe to production.

Conclusions

Aside from the factors discussed above, it is worth bearing in mind the evolution of the graphite sector and
the potential growth in the market for graphene applications, as many of the companies mentioned in this
report either personally conduct or financially support R&D into future commercial applications using
graphene. While the market is in its infancy (annual demand estimated at between 500-1,000 tonnes) the
potential for growth in demand for this product stream is considerable. In this regard it should be
highlighted that Talga (in its Vitangi scoping study) has highlighted its ability and intention to initially
produce 1,000 tonnes (scalable) of graphene as part of its overall 47,000 tpa production rate.

In summary, while the graphite sector is dynamic, analytical problems exist in comparing companies based
on publicly available information and the fact that new applications and product specifications are
continually evolving, we believe the factors and analysis contained in this study correctly encapsulate the
key drivers of a successful graphite project. While many of the projects discussed above may continue
through to successful development and expansion, we ultimately believe that more will be disappointed.
