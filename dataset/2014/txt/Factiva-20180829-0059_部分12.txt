China National Aviation Fuel Group Corp. (CNAF.YY), China's largest provider of jet fuel to airliners, is
seeking investments in Europe amid a push to expand globally and become less reliant on its home
carriers.
The company is ready to strike deals to gain access to a wider number of airports in Europe, Chairman
Sun Li said in London.

The company wants its China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corp. (G92.SG) unit, that oversees the
non-China activities, to boost its sales contribution to 40% by 2020 from 23% today, he said in
inaugurating the company's new European office.
China Aviation Oil has been betting that the growth of Chinese carriers abroad will drive expansion of
its own foreign presence. The company last year operated at 30 airports outside its domestic market, up
from only three in 2010. It supplies fuel at 180 airports in China.
"Investment is one of our core business goals," CAO Chief Executive Meng Fanqiu said. The company
is seeking to acquire trading operations while also investing in airport refueling assets overseas.
CAO also wants to build jet fuel supply and trading ties beyond Chinese airlines. The target for the new
European operation is to grow that customer base within a year.
The push overseas comes as Chinese aviation growth rates have moderated, although domestic
capacity growth in March still grew 9.7% year-over-year, with traffic up 5.2%, according to the
International Air Transport Association.
CAO, owned to 51% by China National Aviation Fuel Group, with BP PLC (BP, BP.LN) holding a 20%
stake and the rest traded in Singapore, is considering setting up an office in Australia next year. The
European operation also will serve as a hub to build ties into the Middle East, Mr. Meng said.
CAO, which also trades other oil products beyond jet fuel, saw first quarter sales this year rise 6.5% to
$4 billion. The company also is seeking to expand its non-jet fuel activities, with the gas oil activities
also poised to grow in Europe.

As airlines explore the potential to use of bio-jet fuel amid a global push to curb carbon dioxide
emissions, CAO said it would monitor how the market evolves and "seek market entry opportunities."
Europe has been leading a push to expand emissions trading to airlines.
