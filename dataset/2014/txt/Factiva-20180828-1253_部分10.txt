Our market is focussed on the profit reports that are beginning to come through in large numbers.
Japan has reported mixed eco numbers and China's numbers reported so far are below expectations
(below in news of the day) while IP and retail sales growth will be out shortly.

Our profit results reported today reflect strong and well managed companies with highly creditable results
and generally handsome dividend yields - although share price action is varied!

Offshore interest has also picked up at the start of our profit reporting season.

"Resistance at 5547, support at 5510 followed by 5500 .. down 5 points'
Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "Copper had a bit of a sell off last night, holding just
above critical support at $3.15/lb. A break of $3.15 will more than likely see it head back to $3 which would
be quite bearish for the short term uptrend it has been in since March.

"Crude is just above the key support level of $97 a barrel. A break of $97 more than likely will see it head
back down to $92/93 a barrel - the IEA commented that despite the tensions there has not been any
disruptions to supply.

"The Shanghai market ran into a bit of profit taking yesterday. It was sold down during the session but
closed back up near its support. There is a lot of buying momentum there. Resistance remains at 2227. It
certainly looks like a break to the upside is more than likely. Downside support is at 2105. It is a very
bullish picture on the Chinese market against other global indices.

"The German index has been grossly over sold over the last couple of weeks. I expect a bounce to 9600.
The key level of support remains 9000. It needs to hold for the week. The picture remains bearish there.

Page23of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."The S&P 500 was strong on the opening and then faded. There seems to be continued selling pressure
there. Momentum is still on the downside. Technically it is threatening to continue its downtrend. The key
level of support will remain at the 100 day moving average of 1917. A break of that will see it back down to
1850.

"I was expecting a bit more of a bounce from German and US markets this week. It is certainly interesting
at this point on whether they resume their downtrend.

"For our market, it was an extremely strong day yesterday. The next level for the bulls is the 20 day
moving average which is sitting at 5547. The bulls will want to see our market close above that for this
week.

"The short term picture looks a lot better than the DAX and S&P. Support is at 5500. If we break that then
we will test 5450, the lows of earlier this week.

"Our SPI was up against the rest of the markets - there seems to be more buying support in our market at
present. There is better value in the resources and some selected industrials. I have been reducing
exposure to the big four and lifting exposure to some diversified resources especially BHP. I expect
resources to outperform for the rest of this week if metal prices hold.

"For today resistance is at 5547. Support is at 5510 followed by 5500.

"I can't call us up again after yesterday's rise. I will call us down 5 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 rose 73.3 points to close at 5530.3 last evening.

the most margin upside among majors from wholesale funding spread improvement and term deposit

guaranteed facilities reaching maturity through full year 2014.

some of its key operating environments. "Taking all factors into account the company expects
Management EPS for full year 2015 to be around 5% higher than 2014".

Analysts expectations: $US330 mln/$US332.3, div 15c/$US336mln, div 16c/$US331.

*On August 8 a leading broker had a "neutral" on Computershare with a price target of $13.70. The broker
said the company has guided for $US $ management eps to be up 5/10% on pcp. However most
estimates re at the upper end of this range. The broker expects 2nd half 2014 margin income to come in at
around $US93 million, down from $US106 million in first half 2014 and expects the company to guide
for 5/10% growth since the company tends to take a fairly cautious view.

Page26of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The broker forecast US eps growth of 12% with consensus growth expectations roughly 11%.

*On August 6 a leading broker retained an "underweight" on Computershare while raising the price target
from $11 to $11.30.

The broker said ahead of the results, it raises five key points' a subdued outlook for the core registry
maintenance business that is about 40% of revenue, business services revenues expected to be broadly
flat year on year, its global service model should continue to provide savings, leverage to rising short end
rates is attractive given CPU's $US6 billion float, but there is risk interest rates do not rise fast enough to
meet consensus expectations next year. The broker forecast expanding EBITDA margins to 27.7%,
delivering eps growth of 8.2% vs guidance of 5/10%.

*On July 24 Nomura retained a "neutral" on Computershare with a $12.50 price target. The broker said
within the diversified financial sector, "Our preference is for CPU (Neutral) given its exposure to the
improving US economy.
Company guidance: On July 1 Computershare Ltd announced it expects to make net writedowns of
approximately $US40 million after tax as at end June 2014. The writedowns comes as the company
nears the end of its review of non core and non strategic assets. Outgoing CEO Stuart Crosby saId no
further writedowns are expected and more detail will be provided at the 2014 full year results release on

evolvingcar markets in the world.

He also outlined investments in Australia including in Tyresales.com.au and in Stratton Finance. He
concluded "Carsales.com continues to be very well positioned for the future".

Analysts expectations: $93.8 mln, div 17.2c/$94.2 mln, div 17.3c/$96.2 mln.

*On August 7 a leading broker reiterated its July 23 downgrade of Carsales to "Neutral" with a price target
of $10.95. The broker said it expects CRZ to provide an update on the auto manufacturers that had
withdrawn new car inventory as well as some advertising support late last year.. It forecast 13% growth in
dealer revenue driven by price rises in dealer enquiry fees ($5 per enquiry from Feb 1 2013), moderate
volume growth in leads reflecting some sensitivity to the subdued macro conditions and strong non auto
revenue gains.
Among other points, the broker also expects further detail on recent acquisitions - a 50.1% stake in
Stratton Finance and a 49.9% stake in SK Encar.

*On July 1 a leading broker had an "add" on Carsales with a $11.91 target price, up from $11.34. The

under geared balance sheet to add new earnings growth options. Vehicle finance now joins Brazil, South

Future prospects

developing differentiated plasma products, receiving royalty flows from the exploitation of the Human
Papillomavirus Vaccine by Merck & Co Inc and the commercialisation of the company's technology.

Analysts expectations: $US1.27 bln/$US1.299 bln/$US1.354 bln/$US1.357 bln, div 54.7c/$US1.354.7
bln/$US1.297 bln.

*On August 11 a leading broker with an "equal weight" on CSL had a price target of $60.35. The broker
said CSL's IG growth is facing tough competition as the mix-shift to higher priced product is nearly
complete, its lapping Octapharma-related share gains and the high growth in the pcp will be hard to meet.
The broker expects the same for 2014. CSL's specialty products are expected to continue robust double
digit growth, however the coagulation franchise is expected to show weakness even ahead of competitors
product launches. Full year 2015 growth could be more challenged, the broker added.

*On August 6 a leading broker retained a "buy" on CSL with a price target of $82.

The broker said IG revenue growth will be a major forecast. It expects investors to focus on the outlook for
CSL's subcutaneous IVIG product, Hizentra, given the recent favorable FDA committee vote for Baxter's
rival HyQvia product. It is also focused on global supply/demand dynamics for Ig, including recent new
entrants to the US market.

The broker forecast 11.6% EBIT growth for CSL Behring, limited medium term growth for CSL's FVIII
franchise and expects CSL will announce a buyback.

A leading broker on August 4 ahead of CSL's profit report on August 21 retains a "buy" on CSL with a
share price target of $80. The broker said despite a trifecta of events in the past 48 hours, it rates the net
impact as more negative for sentiment than forecasts. The broker expects CSL to meet or beat if 2014
guidance of 10% ccNPAT growth pre adjusted for legal settlement, with the capacity to guide to a further
1-/5 growth in 2015 plus a new buyback program.

The trifecta of events includes the FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee voting in favor of Baxter's
HyQvia product, supporting risk communication strategies but not restricted to labelling. Bayer 2nd quarter
2014 results highlight 17% Kogenate sales decline due to manufacturing restraints and Grifols Bioscience
division reported first half 2014 3.3% gain in CC, down 1% on the previous period, noting an increase in
sales of IVIG and albumin but moderate fall in intermediaries and pdf VIII sales with tender delays.

*A leading broker on the same date had an "accumulate" on CSL with a share price target of $74.48. The
broker said the underlying momentum of the company's plasma derived portfolio continues to be
supported by a range of factors. There is further upside potential in the specialty care portfolio and a
non-valent Gardasil release.

Decreased debt costs, the ongoing buyback, improving payout ratio, the announcement of a partnership
agreement and an insight into the treatment of Alzheimer's are all potential upside risks.

*The Financial Times reported as of Aug 01, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 20 polled investment
analysts covering CSL Limited advises that the company will outperform the market. This has been the
consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts improved on Oct 01, 2013. The previous
consensus forecast advised investors to hold their position in CSL Limited. There were 4 buys, 6
outperforms, 6 holds and 2 sells.

*CWN: Acquires balance 50% of Betfair Austalasia for $10 mln
Crown Resorts Ltd announced it has acquired Betfair Group plc's 50% equity interest in Betfair
Australasia Pty Ltd for $10 million. Betfair Australasia was formed in 2004 as a 50/50 j/v between Crown
and Betfair Group plc. Crown now owns 100% of Betfair Australasia.

*EGP: NPAT up 27.3%, 4c ff div, DRP at no disc/outlook positive

Echo Entertainment Group Ltd for the year ended June 30 announced a net profit after tax up 27.3% to
$106.3 million on revenue up 3.9% to $1.805.7 billion.

Page28of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.A 4c fully franked final dividend was announced. The DRP is available at no discount. Record date is
August 26.

NTA backing per share is $1.32 vs $1.23 last year.

Outlook

Managing director Matt Bekier said: “Echo had begun fiscal 2015 the same way the group concluded fiscal
2014, with good momentum in its major properties.

“The Star is our flagship property where we will continue to invest in product and with new management
coming on board, we expect to see continued improvement in fiscal 2015,” he said.

Analysts expectations: $151.8mn norm/$151.9 mln, div 4c/$151.8 MLN/consensus $152 mn, div 2c ff.

*On August 11 a leading broker had a "lighten" on Carsales with a price target of $2.64.

The broker said it expects Echo to report a 17% increase in management's normalised EBITDA to $432.2
million, a 5% increase in management's normalised net profit to $152.2 million and a 2c per share fully
franked final dividend.

The broker said Echo is currently outperforming in VIP relative to domestic and some international casinos
which are showing flat to negative growth and on the main floor, relative to pubs and clubs in NSW and
QLD.

"At the moment, we believe that Echo is benefitting from increased participation in the loyalty program,
greater non commission spend by customers along with a strong tailwind of slot spend in NSW and QLD.

The broker believes EGP is facing accelerating loss of market share in slots. There is also a worrying
negative mix associated with the decline in electronic gaming vs other lower margin products.

*On August 1 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on EGP with a price target of $3. The broker said with
EGP having provided a trading update and guidance for 2014 it is expecting few surprises in the headline
result. The broker added the big item for Echo is the development of its proposal for the Queen's Wharf
precinct in Brisbane with proposals due by the end of the year. However given the confidential nature of
the bidding process not much new news is expected.

*On July 24 one leading broker had a "buy" on Echo Entertainment with a $4.25 price target after the
announcement of the binding MOU with rival bidders Chow Tai Fook Enterprises and Far East Consortium
Pty Ltd to form a "Destination Brisbane Consortium" for an integrated casino resort proposal in Brisbane.

The broker said with signs of EGP earnings finally beginning to show some of the benefits from numerous
operational improvements and capex, the stock continues to trade at a discount to market.

*Another leading broker retained a $3.90 target price and said the announcement is not entirely
unexpected since the size and scope of the development would stretch echo's ability to finance the project
alone. The broker expects the final decision by the Queensland government in early full year 2015.
Company guidance: On June 16 Echo Entertainment Group Ltd advised in an update on trading and
guidance said based on the revenue momentum of the second half of the year to date, Echo expects to
report normalised 2014 EBITDA within the range of $430/435 million and normalised 2014 NPAT within
the range of $150/153 million. The expected result is above current median analyst forecasts and
reported Bloomberg consensus normalised EBITDA of $411 million on a like for like basis.

Actual EBITDA will be impacted by the win rate and turnover experienced in the VIP Rebate business for
the remainder of the financial year and therefore is subject to potential volatility.

A revenue update for the March quarter was provided on April 1. The underlying normalised revenue
trends experienced across the business in the March quarter continue to prevail.

Across the group normalised gross revenue grew 10.2% on the prior comparable period, of up 12.1% on
an actual basis.

For the domestic business excluding the VIP Rebate business revenue grew 9.3% on the prior
comparable period.
Echo now expects to deliver operating expenditure around $870 million for 2014.

*GFF: Net loss $405.1 mln, 1c ff div, DRP susp/update on Wilmar

Page29of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Goodman Fielder Ltd for the year ended June 30 announced net loss of $405.1 million vs a profit of
$102.5 million last year on revenue down 1.2% to $2.199.9 billion vs $2.227.2 billion last year.

the board subject to an independent expert opinion and a superior offer not being received, the company
said the independent expert's report is expected later this calendar year, when it will be included in a

Analysts expectations: $59.8 mln, 1c unfr final div/$59 mln.

*On August 8 a leading broker had a 'sell" on Goodman Fielder with a 68c price target.

The broker said the result is largely irrelevant as the market focuses on the deal timeline "given the
lengthy process of recent deals, there is a high probability that MOFCOM approval takes significantly
longer than expected, reducing the PV of the deal to well below the 67.5c Scheme price" the broker said in
the report.

*On August 8 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on Goodman Fielder with a 63c price target.

First Pacific Company to acquire all of the shares in GFF for 67.5c cash per share. The scheme allows
GFF to pay a final dividend of 1c per share for 2014. GFF expects to hold the Scheme meeting on
November 3.
Company report: On July 2 Goodman Fielder Ltd announced following completion of due diligence by
Wilmar and First Pacific and negotiations on the proposed scheme, GFF has entered into a Scheme
Implementation Deed with Wilmar and First Pacific whereby Wilmar and First Pacific will require all of the
remaining issued equity in GFF they do not already own for 67.5Ac cash per share (down from 70c
offered earlier) subject to all conditions being satisfied. The scheme also allows GFF to pay a final 1c per
share dividend for 2014.

As previously announced, GFF expects to record a non cash impairment charge for 2014 in the range of
$A300/400 million.

GFF chairman Steve Gregg said in the report the board continued to unanimously recommend to
shareholders that they approve the scheme in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to the

on the previous year.

Managing director Dr Edmund Bateman said in the report during the year Primary focused on a strategy of
backfilling existing medical centres with GP's and other allied health professional to utilise spare capacity,
this has resulted in strong EBITDA growth and margin improvements and will continue in 2015. Primary
also currently has eight new large scale medical centre sites earmarked for development, up more than
10% on the current 58. Performance was strong across Primary's medical centres, pathology and imaging
business.

Page30of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On August 11 a leading broker retained an "overweight" on Primary Health Care with a price target of
$5.760, both unchanged since July. The broker said PRY's performance has been recently clouded by the
government's proposed GP co-payment. We see the associated downside to PRY as minimal for now, we
retain our OW and thesis'.

*On August 6 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on Primary Health Care with a price target of $4.85.

The broker expects 2nd half 2104 EBITDA to be up 7% driven by 6.5% revenue growth from mostly higher
volumes and modest margin expansion as centres mature and are back-filled. It expects investor focus to
be on the cashflow requirements of the business (i.e. GP churn and new medical centre openings) and on
potential changes to the government's proposal to introduce co-payments for GP visits. It notes that
Medical Centre revenue growth has lagged growth in doctor numbers for at least the past two years.

In pathology it forecasts profit growth (EBITDA up 7.5%) driven by 5% revenue growth and margin
expansion from operating leverage. It expects investor focus on potential fee cuts in 2015 and also on
potential co payments for pathology.

*On August 1 a leading broker retained a "hold" on Primary Health Care Ltd and a price target of $4.91.
The broker said the company's ability to backfill GP's into its MC (medical centres) business remains a
key driver of top line growth given the recent hiatus in greenfields developments.

*On July 28 another leading broker had an "add" on Primary Health Care with a $5.68 price target.

The broker said it sees continued evidence of improvement in operational metrics for Australia's largest
private medical centre operator and a major pathology provider, with GP productivity gains helping to
alleviate concerns surrounding GP acquisition costs and churn rates.

discount.

NTA backing per security is 69NZ c vs 73.4NZ c last year.

Normalised eps is 21.3NZ c vs 23.2NZ c last year.
The company said the 2014 result has been adversely impacted by the significant currency appreciation
of the $NZ against the $A.
The company said in the report growth across the core businesses, underpinned by strong Auckland and
International Business performance with good and sustained momentum in the second half was masked
by the continued significant appreciation ofthe NZ dollar against the $A over the year, and disruption at the
existing Adelaide Casino on the extensive construction works as the property is transformed to take
advantage of reforms negotiated with the South Australian government.

Analysts expectations: $NZ121.9 mln

On July 8 a leading broker lowered its rating from "buy" to "neutral" on Sky City Entertainment with a
$NZ4.15 target price.

The broker said it lowered its investment rating to reflect lower medium term earnings growth due to
disruption and delays with Adelaide and Auckland casino expansion projects coupled with a higher $NZ.
This could limit valuation upside over the next 12 months and create downside risk to consensus earnings.

interest expense and higher D&A.
It expects net debt to increase to $149 million from $45 million last year and $133 million in the first half
with net debt/EBITDA at 1.5x. This reflects the impact of acquisitions (Broadsword Marine in July 2013

the company to provide an update on the cost reduction strategy including targets for 2015.
