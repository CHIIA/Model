Leoben (pts040/07.05.2014/18:11) - AT&S reported outstanding results in the
financial year 2013/14. Sales and profitability improved consistently.
AT&S Group's sales for the financial year 2013/14 reached EUR 590m, an
increase
of around 9% on the previous year's total (2012/13: approx. EUR 542m).
Earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amounted to
EUR
127m, an increase of around 24% on the 2012/13 total of around EUR 102m.
Consolidated net income for the financial year 2013/14 rose to EUR 38m. The
capital increase (gross proceeds of about EUR 100m) and the placement of a
bonded loan (gross proceeds of EUR 158m) led to an improvement in the
Group's
financing structure. The gearing ratio declined to 28% (2012/13: approx.
71%).
"I am delighted that we have been able to achieve consistent growth and
continuous improvements in our profitability in a challenging economic
environment over the past few years. Capacity utilisation in our core
business
is currently very high. I am optimistic that the strong positioning of our
core
business means that we are ideally positioned to benefit from the trends
that
require high-tech applications such as wearables, the increasing number of
automotive electronics and the 'Internet of Things'. And I am certain that
we
are well prepared for the next significant phase of growth with our
strategic
focus on the new IC substrates business at our plant in Chongqing,"
explained
CEO
Andreas Gerstenmayer.

Mobile Devices reaffirms position as high-tech supplier
Mobile Devices' sales for the financial year 2013/14 reached EUR 321m, an
improvement of around 8% on the previous year's total (2012/13: EUR 297m).
AT&S
strengthened its position as a high-tech supplier to leading smartphone and
tablet manufacturers. This resulted in various changes to the customer
portfolio, including additional business from existing customers and the
acquisition of new customers in areas such as the wearables segment. The
Shanghai plant reported high capacity utilisation throughout the financial
year.
IC substrate plant in Chongqing
The setup of the Chongqing plant with a strategic focus on the new
integrated
circuit (IC) substrates business is progressing according to plan. During
the
financial year 2013/14 the focus was on building infrastructure. The next
milestone is the installation and qualification of the production
machinery.
Industrial & Automotive reports significant growth in demand for high-value
printed circuit boards
Industrial and Automotive's sales for the financial year 2013/14 reached
EUR
265m, an increase of around 9% on the previous year's total (2012/13:
approx.
EUR 243m). Automotive reported a record year driven by sales of high-value
printed circuit boards for energy efficiency, safety, infotainment and
entertainment applications. Moderate but continuously growing demand for
industrial applications made a significant contribution to the segment's
positive performance. The company is also expecting 'Industry 4.0' to have
a
significant impact on growth over the medium term. AT&S's medical
technology
business also performed very positively, an area where the Group is
focusing on
therapy, diagnostics and patient monitoring.

AT&S is well positioned to benefit from the increasing trend towards
miniaturisation thanks to its patented ECP® embedding technology, and was
awarded a number of long-term projects over the course of the past
financial
year.
AT&S supports key electronics industry trends
The AT&S Group addresses key trends in all segments with its high-value
printed
circuit boards. In the automotive segment, demand for HDI printed circuit
boards
has grown sharply as vehicles become increasingly connected. AT&S
identified
this trend at an early stage and is now one of the first points of call for
the
leading suppliers to Europe's premium car manufacturers.
'Machine-to-Machine'
communication and process automation are the key drivers in the industrial
segment. In medical technology, therapeutic applications such as hearing
aids
call for high-value, reliable solutions that represent the state of the
art. In
Mobile Devices, management expects high growth rates for wearables such as
smartwatches. AT&S is well placed to supply all of these innovative
applications
thanks to its high-quality solutions such as HDI technology and embedding.
About AT&S

European
market leader and one of the world's leading producers of high-end printed
