T-Mobile US, Inc. Analyst Notes

On May 13, 2014, T-Mobile US, Inc. (T-Mobile) released the findings of a new survey of international
travelers, which revealed an intense disparity between carrier customers who turn off their phones to
avoid excesses and T-Mobile customers who travel with much more freedom and flexibility. According to
T-Mobile's own customer data, T-Mobile customers travelling abroad now make three times more calls,
text seven times more often, and use 28 times more data, while enjoying major savings as compared to
carrier customers. John Legere, President and CEO, T-Mobile, said, "It's completely outrageous that old
guard carriers are still raking in billions each year from these ridiculous roaming fees. That they continue
to gouge their customers to the tune of 90 percent margins every time they set foot outside the country is
shameful. Americans deserve better." The full analyst notes on T-Mobile are available to download free of

On May 8, 2014, First Solar, Inc. (First Solar) and IXL Group of Companies (IXL) jointly announced the
opening of IXL's new structure manufacturing plant in Adelaide. According to First Solar, the facility will
enable IXL to assemble and deliver the mounting structures for the former's 155 MW utility-scale solar
photovoltaic projects at Nyngan and Broken Hill in New South Wales. First Solar expects the plant to
create around 40 jobs as a part of its commitment to support Australian manufacturers. Jack Curtis, First
Solar's Vice President of Business Development for Asia Pacific, said, "As the solar industry continues to
grow in Australia, there will be an increasing need and demand for a reliable and efficient local supplier
base. Continued utilisation of local suppliers will not only reduce the cost of delivering solar power to
Australia, but it will also create local jobs, develop regional skills and support more sustainable
employment." The full analyst notes on First Solar are available to download free of charge at:
