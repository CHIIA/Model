The Japanese market had slipped shortly before its close today then steadied. Futures indexes for other
major markets were slightly higher.

Page258of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Was 5400 the target close off for the year, with a large enough 'sell" portfolio/portfolios to achieve it -
related to the SPI Futures that fell more sharply than the physical, on huge volume?

There seems little other explanation for the fall on the close.

Market expected to close barely higher

Gerald Stanley, a Fibonacci chartist said, "I expect the market to trade within the narrow range of
Thursday's high and Friday's low, closing mildly higher, i.e. up 9".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 19.2 points to 5445.1 last Friday.

New home sales down in May but up 3.8% in 3 months to May

Reuters reports sales of new homes in Australia fell in May for the first time in five months, possibly a sign
that the housing market may have peaked in this cycle, an industry survey showed on Monday.

The Housing Industry Association (HIA) said its survey of large builders showed sales of private sector
new homes fell 4.3 percent in May from April.

Still, sales grew by 3.8 percent over the three months to May to be up 21.0 percent compared with the
same period a year ago.

Multi-unit sales dropped 16.1 percent in May, while detached house sales slipped 2.2 percent.

Record-low interest rates have led to a marked pickup in home prices and clearance rates at auctions,
while approvals to build new homes are trending higher.

The SILEX Uranium Enrichment Technology is licensed to Global Laser Enrichment LLC (GLE) a
consortium of GE 51%, Hitachi 25% and Cameco 24% with worldwide exclusive rights for the comemrcial
exploitaiton of the technology. GLE has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to date and subject to
satisfactory economics, market conditions and regulatory requirements continues to fund the program
towards potential construction of the first commercial production plant. The SILEX Technology
represents the most significant future revenue potential with Silex to receive a perpetual royalty between
7% and 12% of GLE's revenues. The company is now accelerated strategic commercial partnerships or
transactions for subsidiary businesses Chronologic, Translucent and Solar Systems, with the aim of
completing the restructure by end of first half 2015.

The restructure should reduce cash burn of between 60% and 80% in full year 2015 vs 2014 with further
significant reductions in 2016 without factoring in any income that may result from potential transactions.

Talks regarding the establishment of the Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility continue to proceed
constructively, albeit slower than hoped. A positive outcome would potentially provide a clear path to
market for Silex's disruptive laser enrichment technology and set a strong commercial path for Silex.
However it should also be appreciated that both uranium and enrichment pricing is at decade lows.
