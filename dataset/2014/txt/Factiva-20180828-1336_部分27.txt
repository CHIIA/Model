OPERATIONS

Safety

Fortescue has taken decisive actions to reinforce that safety is the highest priority for everyone on a
Fortescue site. The drive towards world class performance in safety continued during the June 2014
quarter with the Safety Excellence project focusing on enhancing safety leadership. The project is
delivering results with improvements to safety outcomes among contracting partners and the sharing of
incident lessons.
The total recordable injury frequency rate per million hours worked was 6.0 in the June 2014 quarter, a
five per cent improvement over the previous quarter and 21 per cent lower than the prior comparable
period.

Aboriginal Engagement

Page77of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Fortescue's vision to create partnerships which deliver lasting benefits to Aboriginal Communities through
the provision of training, employment and economic development opportunities continued in FY14 with a
number of significant achievements.
In the June 2014 quarter, contracts and sub-contracts valued at A$40 million were awarded to Aboriginal
businesses and joint ventures, bringing the total awarded contracts value to A$497 million in FY14 and
the total value under the Billion Opportunities program to A$1.58 billion. There was also a significant
increase in the commitment of Fortescue's contracting partners to provide second tier contract
opportunities, with sub-contracts worth A$233 million awarded to Aboriginal businesses and joint
ventures in FY14.

In FY14, Fortescue's Vocational Training and Employment Centres (VTECs) trained and provided jobs for
122 people. Aboriginal people represent more than 12 per cent of Fortescue's direct workforce and over
1,100 Aboriginal people are employed through our operations.
Mining, Processing and Shipping
The June 2014 quarter delivered a seventh consecutive shipping record with 38.7mt of ore shipped, a 23
per cent increase over the previous quarter and a 55 per cent increase over the prior comparable period.
Shipments included 37.6 million Fortescue equity tonnes and 1.1 million third party tonnes.
During the June 2014 quarter, Fortescue mined 43.8mt of ore, 48 per cent higher than the previous
quarter. This increase was largely due to the combination of increased performance in operations
through efficiency initiatives as well as the continuity of work achieved through the dry season. Ore mined
in the June 2014 quarter was 28 per cent higher than the prior comparable period. Fortescue drew down
ROM iron ore stocks by six per cent in the June 2014 quarter and aims to continue reductions in the
September 2014 quarter.

Strip ratios at the Chichester Hub averaged 3.2 for the June 2014 quarter, slightly below the five year
mine plan of 3.5 due to the nature of the mining areas. The strip ratio across the Solomon Hub was 1.3
during the June 2014 quarter as mining moved closer to a steady state, following the ramp up of
operations at the Kings Valley project.
The operation of the Kings Valley Ore Processing Facility (OPF) through the June 2014 quarter lifted
Fortescue's production capacity beyond 155 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). Fortescue's total output
from all processing facilities increased to a record 41.1mt in the June 2014 quarter, 32 per cent higher
than the prior quarter and work continues allowing transition to our steady state product mix.
During the June 2014 quarter the Kings Valley OPF has been used to process detrital ore overlying the
main Kings CID ore. Kings CID has now commenced to form a core product and provide the planned
product mix grades.

Over the June 2014 quarter, Fortescue and Leighton

Contractors completed a successful transition of full operational responsibility for the two Solomon Hub
OPFs and the train load out facility to Fortescue. This strategic business decision now gives Fortescue
operational responsibility over all five of its OPFs, enabling shared learnings, synergies, economies of
scale and efficiency increases across the business.
Port and Rail operations continued to operate consistently at and above an annualised run rate of
155mtpa during the June 2014 quarter. Further optimisation work continues to deliver increased
productivity and efficiency.

Production Costs

C1 costs for the June 2014 quarter were US$34.03/wmt, a two per cent improvement over the prior
quarter and lower than guidance. The improved performance was due to lower strip ratios at the Solomon
and Chichester Hubs together with operational improvements at the OPFs. Full year C1 costs were
US$33.84/wmt, below guidance and 23 per cent lower than the previous financial year.
This improvement reflects the benefit of lower cost Solomon operations, improved processing capacity
lowering strip ratios at the Chichester Hub, operational efficiencies and a lower Australian dollar.
Fortescue continues to focus on costs in order to move down the global cost curve. In the June 2014
quarter, total delivered costs to customers were US$49/wmt inclusive of C1 costs and shipping, royalty
and administration costs, eight per cent lower than the prior quarter. Total delivered costs to customers
for the full year were US$52/wmt.

Page78of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The US to Australian dollar exchange rate averaged 0.93 for the June 2014 quarter (0.90 in the March
2014 quarter). Fortescue remains sensitive to movements in exchange rates with C1 costs impacted by
US$0.25/t to US$0.30/t for every one cent movement in the US to Australian dollar.

Forecast Production and Costs

Forecast shipping volumes for FY15 are 155-160mt at a C1 operating cost of US$31-32/wmt. This
guidance reflects a full year of operations from the Kings Valley project, operational cost efficiencies and
an average US to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.90.

MARKETING
The key iron ore pricing references applicable to major Australian producers are the 62% Platts and
MBIO 58% indices. These indices are essentially determined by reference to the spot market created by
the sales price achieved for Rio Tinto's Pilbara Blend, BHP's MAC and Newman Fines (62% Platts), and
BHP's Yandi (MBIO 58% + Premium).

Fortescue's suite of products is sold with reference to the 62% Platts index with a market price
comparable to other products which have similar value-in-use properties for steel production.

The graph below sets out price relativities between the 62% Platts index, Fortescue Blend, Fortescue
Super Special Fines, Metal Bulletin 58% Premium index and the Metal Bulletin 58% index. The graph
shows that while there have been variations in prices across the year, Fortescue's major products have
consistently priced in line with similar products relative to the 62% Platts index.
Over the June 2014 quarter iron ore prices have traded lower and at a wider spread which has
historically been the case in a low price environment. This reflects the significant increase in new
seabourne iron ore supply, tighter credit conditions in China and relatively high Chinese port stocks.
During the June 2014 quarter iron ore prices have been volatile resulting in a price realization of 80 per
cent comparted to the average 62% Platts index.

In FY14 Fortescue's average price realisation was 86 per cent compared to the average 62% Platts index.
Fortescue expects supply to re-balance in the short term as port inventories are drawn down, steel mills
re-stock and higher cost iron ore production leaves the market. As this occurs and Fortescue transitions
to a product suite dominated by the high quality Fortescue Blend and Kings CID products, realised prices
are expected to range between 85 and 90 per cent of the 62% Platts price index going forwards.

CORPORATE

Balance Sheet
Fortescue's net debt position at 30 June 2014 was US$7.2 billion, including finance leases of US$0.3
billion and cash on hand of US$2.4 billion. Fortescue's flexible debt profile facilitates additional
repayments and the ability to deliver on the strategy to further debt reduction and move towards an initial
targeted gearing level of 40 per cent.

As noted in the debt maturity profile below Fortescue's earliest debt maturity is in 2017. Further, a total of
US$5.8 billion, or in excess of 60 per cent, of the company's long term debt is available for voluntary
repayment in advance of maturity and at Fortescue's option.

Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure in FY14 was US$1.9 billion, slightly below guidance due to the deferral of
approximately US$100 million into FY15. As a result, FY15 expenditure is now estimated to be US$1.3
billion, excluding any capital expenditure associated with the Iron Bridge joint venture, which is fully
funded by the Formosa Plastics Group.
All T155 expansion projects have been completed and US$9.2 billion was capitalised during FY14.
Based on the current fixed asset base, Fortescue estimates its depreciation and amortisation expenditure
to be US$8.50/wmt shipped.

Ship Construction
Fortescue has entered into arrangements for the construction of four highly efficient very large ore
carriers (VLOCs) for a total investment value of US$275 million.

Construction is expected to commence in the second half of 2014 and delivery is scheduled for November
2016 through to May 2017 with the majority of payments due on delivery.

Page79of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In addition, advanced negotiations are underway to secure four additional VLOCs with another major
Chinese ship builder. These ships are expected to be delivered in late 2017 and early 2018 with the
majority of payments also due on delivery.

Fortescue's shipping strategy is to lock in construction of these VLOCs which are being designed to
complement the port infrastructure to improve load rates, efficiencies and reduce operating costs.
Flexibility has been built into the ownership structure of these VLOCs which will allow Fortescue to
explore alternative financing structures at a later date. The investment will initially be funded by existing
operating cash flows and due to the timing of cash payments, is not expected to impact Fortescue's debt
repayment strategy.

Fortescue expects the operating cost of these vessels to be well below the current forward market rates
for large capesize vessels. This, together with expected through put benefits and operational savings at
the port, support the investment in these vessels.

DEVELOPMENT

Fortescue River Gas Pipeline
Fortescue is executing a plan to lower energy costs and reduce its carbon footprint by transitioning its
Pilbara operations from diesel to natural gas. As a first step, the Fortescue River Gas Pipeline will deliver
gas from the Dampier to Perth Pipeline to the Solomon Power Station with completion scheduled in the
March 2015 quarter.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)

As an interim step in advance of completion of the natural gas pipeline, Fortescue will truck compressed
natural gas (CNG) from facilities in Port Hedland to gas receiving facilities installed at the Solomon Power
Station. Deliveries are scheduled to commence in August 2014 and will run until the Fortescue River
pipeline is fully commissioned.

AP5 Project

The project to build the fifth wharf at Anderson Point, AP5, remains on schedule and on budget for
completion in the March 2015 quarter. Dredging was completed in the June 2014 quarter and installation
of wharf piles has commenced. All major contracts have been awarded and fabrications of wharf modules
are under way in China and Western Australia.

Detrital Processing Plant

Construction of a 5mtpa detrital processing plant at Solomon was approved at the end of May 2014. This
facility will allow detrital ore to be processed, eliminating the need for an expensive wet plant addition to
the Firetail OPF and freeing the Kings Valley OPF to process Kings CID ore. Early contractor involvement
is underway and an award for the core processing facility is expected in July 2014. Project duration is
estimated at 55 weeks at a cost of approximately US$105 million.
Iron Bridge Project

Construction activities continue to achieve planned milestones. The main construction camp is complete,
access roads and earthworks at the Northstar OPF are nearing completion and pre-strip activities are
progressing. Concrete works at the OPF are well advanced with commencement of structural, mechanical
and piping works. The electrical and instrumentation package of works has been tendered and a contract
award is expected in July 2014. First production from the 1.5mtpa OPF is expected in the March 2015
quarter.

Incremental Train Control System (ITCS)

ITCS has been implemented across Fortescue's rail system and is now fully operational. The system is
delivering improvements in train scheduling, operations and optimisation of the network.

EXPLORATION AND FUTURE STUDIES

The 2014 exploration drilling program continued throughout the June 2014 quarter. Of note the
Cloudbreak brownfield drilling program has shown useful zones of Mineralization. The Christmas Creek
brownfield drilling program will be completed in the September 2014 quarter. A diamond rig also began
work in the Western Hub to provide core samples for metallurgical analysis.

Page80of248©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Work continues on identifying and defining new targets for bedded Mineralization in and around the
existing Chichester and Solomon hubs. An updated Reserve and Resource Statement incorporated in the
FY14 Annual Report will further define long term production potential from our extensive resource base.
