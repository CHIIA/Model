K&L Gates Acts for Gunson Resources Limited in Acquisition of Strandline Resources Pty Ltd, Opening
the Gateway to Tanzania
Perth - Global law firmK&L Gates has advised Perth-based mineral exploration and development
companyGunson Resources Limited (Gunson) in the acquisition of Strandline Resources Pty Ltd
(Strandline), a privately owned Australian mineral sands mining services company.

Strandline's assets consist of 100% working interests in 16 granted mineral sands exploration tenements,
covering more than 2,000 square kilometres along the under-explored coast of Tanzania, and two
exploration applications covering another 160 square kilometres of land along the same coastline.
Concurrent with the Strandline Acquisition, K&L Gates also acted for Gunson in its placement to raise
AUD$2.2 million (before costs) with each Gunson share being priced at 1.5 cents. Gunson is currently
implementing a share purchase plan to raise up to AUD$1 million (before costs).
The K&L Gates team advising Gunson was led by Perth energy, infrastructure and resources partner
Adam Levine, senior associate Su Sze Ting, and lawyer Natasha Augustin.

Levine stated: "Although still at an early stage of exploration, the Tanzanian coastline appears to be
highly prospective for world-class economic heavy mineral sands accumulations, making this a very
exciting acquisition for our client. K&L Gates' Africa group is well-placed to assist with what is likely to
be continued investment into Africa in this sector."

infrastructure, transportation, telecommunications, and financial services.
