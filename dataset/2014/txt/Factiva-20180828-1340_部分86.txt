"Ceiling will be 5480. Floor will be 5435. Close at 5455, up 2.5 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract up 10 points.

"While yesterdays decline was unexpected, it was not a total surprise given that volatility usually increases
in a significant manner leading into an important top. "There were two important developments yesterday.

"First, our market closed the second gap up on the daily chart for the rally that commenced 1-July-2014,
which would not have occurred if it was an initiation of a strong market advance.

"The other, perhaps more important, development was the Aussie 10-year bond yield printing a new low.

"Something is spooking our bond market in a big way, which arguably has not been discounted in the
price of most Aussie equities.

"One could argue the decline in Aussie bond yields is simply a function of a global reach for yield or
perhaps a flight to safety. From an intermarket viewpoint however, the predominant explanation is
subdued economic growth expectations.

"But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5480. The floor will be 5435. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5455, up 2.5 points'.

production for 2014 of 342,773 ozs was broadly in line with guidance of 345,000 ozs. Cash costs of
$A922/oz subject to any audit adjustment are expected to be marginally above guidance of $890 per oz.
The actual average exchange rate for 2014 of $A1/$US0.916 was lower than the assumed rate, which had
a negative impact on the cash costs when reported in Australian dollars.

production for 2015 is forecast to be 315,000 ozs at a cash cost of $890/9z with the lower production
impacted by the conclusion oft he Golden Pride mine in Tanzania after 15 years of production and slightly
lower grade ore being expected at the Ravenswood mine in Queensland in line with the Life of Mine Plan.

processing plant expected to be commissioned in January 2015, partly offsetting the falls.

fund planned expansion and exploration programs. (Jul 9)
