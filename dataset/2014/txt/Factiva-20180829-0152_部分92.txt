MARKET CLOSES DOWN A TOUCH IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS

Our market closed down 7.9 points to 5317 after a short covering rally took it to a high of 5346.3 intra
day. The banks, that contributed 10 positive points at midday contributed 2.5 negative points at the close
of trade while resources stocks were sharply lower, led down by iron ore miners on China's slower
growth scenario. Volume at $3.1 billion was the best so far this year. The $A is at 89.19US c, down
down 35 points on last evening.
*Mt Gibson fell 6.5c to 94c on 8.49m shares, Atlas Iron fell 9.5c to $1.06.5 on 35.9m shares.

*Magellan Financial rose 40c to $10.88 on 335,263 shares and Magellan Flagship rose 97c to $31.47 on
37,437 shares while James Hardie, also among US/Europe facing stocks rose 37c to $12.94 on 737,269
shares.

Among the golds, the only riser was Medusa, up 4c to $2.27 on 1.2m shares - meanwhile Reuters
reported today that Indian officials are in discussions to cut a record high import duty on gold and relax
rules on exports, government sources said, after the measures helped narrow the country's trade deficit
and now threaten to encourage smuggling.

With three duty hikes last year to a record 10 percent and onerous restrictions tying purchases to exports,
official arrivals shrank almost 90 percent in the six months to November, helping China displace India as
the world's top gold buyer.

The decision to cut the import duty is likely to be taken anytime this month.

At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 80 points to 15,820 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
up 3.03 points to 2048.74, Hang Seng futures was up 64 points to 22742, S&P futures was up 3 points to
1824, Nasdaq futures was up 6 points to 3524, Dow futures was up 25 points to 16,390 points.
Gold futures were up $1.60 to $1239.60. Crude futures rose 15c to $93.58.
