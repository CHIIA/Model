RESOURCES IRON prices slumped to a near two-year low yesterday, further denting Australia’s
largest export earner and the wallets of two of the country’s mining billionaires Andrew Forrest and
Gina Rinehart.
Amid growing fears of slowing steel demand in China and an oversupply of iron ore, the spot price of
iron ore fell to $US102.75 a tonne, its lowest level since September 2012 and well down from its
September 2011 peak of more than $US180 a tonne.

“Iron ore exports to China are surging. Australia is exporting record volumes but demand and
sentiment in the Chinese steel industry remains relatively flat,” the Australian managing editor for the
energy and metals information service Platts, Paul Bartholomew, said.
Despite slowing Chinese demand for steel, Australia has seen its iron ore exports grow around 40 per
cent over the past two years to more than 400 million metric tonnes. Australian exports are expected
to grow a further 90 million tonnes this year.
The supply of Australian iron ore will increase even further when the Roy Hill mine, 70 per cent owned
by Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting, is expected to start production by 2016.
The mine aims to export 55 million tonnes of iron ore a year. Australia already accounts for more than
half of China’s iron or imports.

Fortescue Metals shares fell 10c to $4.71. The miner’s share price has fallen 22 per cent since
mid-February, shaving $1.35 billion off chairman Andrew Forrest’s stake.BHP Billiton shares fell 20c
to $37.144 while Rio Tinto closed 5c higher after hovering a near six month low in intraday trade.
