Milk to China could be saviour of dairy farms QUEENSLAND dairy farmers could soon start
selling fresh milk to China for up to $9 a litre.
Under a trial by the farmer-owned Norco, farmers get 50¢ to 60¢ a litre for the milk, which is flown
to China where consumers are prepared to pay between $8 and $9 a litre.

One shipment of 4500 litres from NSW two weeks ago had such an impact with
environmentally-conscious middle-class Chinese, that Norco has been swamped with inquiries
from other importers.
The next order is for 20,000 litres but the aim is for millions of litres. Desperate Queensland dairy
farmers hope that it might help arrest the industry crash that has resulted in 100 farms being sold
since Coles started the home brand milk wars in 2011.

Norco Co-op chief executive Brett Kelly said he was stunned at the result. It had taken 18 months
to get quality assurance and testing requirements in place to satisfy the Chinese. The key was
Australia’s clean and green reputation on world markets.
“The Chinese middle- class is renowned for being well educated, quite well off and focused on
health, especially in regard to their children,’’ he said.
Kenilworth dairy farmer Peter Rough said every farmer was praying for the scheme to
succeed.Queensland Dairyfarmers’ Organisation chief exec-utive Adrian Peake said the need for
another market was critical.
