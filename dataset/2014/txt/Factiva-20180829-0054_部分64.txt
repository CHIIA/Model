0110 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is up 0.2% at 5524 after hitting a marginally higher
4-week high of 5530.4 following a 0.6% rise and record high in the S&P 500. Financials are supporting
the market amid low volatility and low bond yields. CBA (CBA.AU) is up 0.2% at A$81.85 after hitting a
record high of A$81.94, QBE (QBE.AU) gains 2% after Macquarie upgraded the insurer. But analysts
continue to predict a pullback, due to seasonal factors and low trading volumes. "From an equity
strategy perspective ultra-low volatility and ultra-low trading volumes concern me tactically," says Bell
Potter's managing director, Charlie Aitken. "That suggests to me the foundations of equity markets at
these index level are not as sturdy as prices would suggest." Gold and iron ore miners are
underperforming, with Newcrest (NCM.AU) down 3.9% after spot gold fell 2.1% and Fortescue
(FMG.AU) flat after spot iron ore fell 0.5%. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DRWSJ)

0058 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY may test the 100 level, if the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield falls
below its recent low, says Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo. The
10-year yield was down despite upbeat economic data yesterday, in what may suggest the possibility
that U.S. long-term interest rates find it difficult to rise because investors' U.S. bond short positions still
remain. "If this view proves correct, it is considered that the risk surrounding U.S. long-term interest rates
for now is leaning toward the downward direction," he says. Based on U.S.-Japan interest rate
differentials so far this year, the USD/JPY is tipped at 100.05, which is consistent with the 10-year yield
at 2.4%. The pair is at 101.91 against 101.97 in late New York Tuesday. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)
0028 GMT [Dow Jones] Gold is trading in a tight range, testing key support, after falling 2.3% in the spot
market overnight to its lowest since February. Signs of an improvement in the U.S. economy and hopes
of a more politically stable Ukraine dimmed investor appetite for the safehaven asset. A stronger USD
also weighed on prices. A sustained break below near-term support of $1,262.70/oz--the 61.8%
retracement of the 1Q rally--could "shift focus" to the December low, Scotiabank says in a report. Spot
gold prices fell to $1,182.70/oz in December. Silver has resolved its own consolidation pattern, the bank
says, adding that $19/oz is the key downside level, followed by $18.85/oz. Spot gold is at $1,262.70/oz,
down 60 cents from its previous close, while silver is at $19.05/oz, down 2 cents.

0021 GMT [Dow Jones] Spot EUR/GBP's rise Tuesday from 0.8080 to 0.8117 is mainly due to a
near-term short-EUR positioning squeeze, BNP Paribas says. The bank says U.K. fundamentals remain
favorable and expects Wednesday's release of U.K. May CBI quarterly distributive trades survey (due
1000 GMT) to show improvement to +35 from +30 following last week's very strong U.K. April retail sales
data. BNP Paribas suggests maintaining short EUR/GBP positions with a 0.78 target and placing a
buy-stop at 0.8265 to limit losses. Spot EUR/GBP is recently at 0.8107. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0019 GMT [Dow Jones] Morgan Stanley slashes Thai GDP growth forecasts to zero for 2014 and 3% for
2015 versus previous forecasts of 3% and 4%. "The downside surprise in 1Q14 has already lowered the
incoming growth trajectory and the recent coup adds to growth pressures," Morgan Stanley strategists
say. "Other non-political macro challenges such as high leverage, weaker productivity, softening global

Page150of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.export share and poor demographics also hamper the growth recovery." With elections unlikely within 12
months, they see less room for monetary policy stimulus and a V-shaped recovery. Thailand's equity
market risk is "skewed to the downside" as "valuations are relatively full, risks are rising and growth is
slowing, they say. USD/THB should fall to 36.5 by end-2014, as weaker tourism and portfolio flows
should mitigate the supportive effect of lower imports, they add. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

2359 GMT [Dow Jones] Aristocrat's (ALL.AU) price-to-earnigs ratio of 24 times expected earnings per
share is hard to justify, says BBY analyst Moira Daw. She reiterates her underperform rating on the
slot-machine maker after its first-half results. First-half net profit after tax rose 9.2% on year to A$57.4
million, in line with market expectations, mostly due to a lower Australian dollar and tax rate. Revenue
rose 7.6% but fell 2.2% in constant-currency terms. BBY's recent price target was A$4.30/share. ALL last
A$5.17. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DRWSJ)
2358 GMT [Dow Jones] Mitsui Fudosan (8801.TO) is set to fall following the firm's announcement after
the Tuesday TSE close that it would raise up to Y325 billion via a share offering. The deal is the biggest
such offering in Japan this year and the first for Mitsui Fudosan in more than three decades. Mitsui
Fudosan said it plans to use the proceeds from its offering to invest in office buildings and retail facilities
in Japan as well as Olympics-related projects ahead of the 2020 Tokyo games. Pre-market bid/ask levels
are at Y3,110/Y3,111 vs Tuesday's close at Y3,340 as investors factor in share base dilution. Mitsui
Fudosan said it would issue up to 100 million new shares for the offer. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

2354 GMT [Dow Jones] Base metals are likely to remain supported after upbeat U.S. economic data
overnight and hopes of stimulus from the Chinese government bolstered the demand outlook. Data
Tuesday showed an improvement in U.S. consumer confidence in May and a 0.8% rise in U.S. durable
goods orders in April, bucking calls for a 0.7% drop. Analysts say expectations of a pickup in business
activity are turning many investors bullish towards industrial metals including copper. However, a
stronger USD could limit further gains as commodities priced in USD appear costlier to holders of other
currencies. LME 3-month copper ended up 0.1% Tuesday at $6,933/ton--its highest price since March
7--and aluminum closed 0.8% higher at $1,828/ton. (arpan.mukherjee@wsj.com; Twitter:

2314 GMT [Dow Jones] Tower's rating was increased to outperform from neutral by Credit Suisse
following the release of a 1H14 result that beat the investment bank's forecasts. Credit Suisse says that
the 1H14 result demonstrated a continuation of gross written premium growth of 5%; a stabilization of
reinsurance espenses; improving underlying claim ratio and a solid excess captial position; "Tower has
simplified and cleaned up its business and is now in a position to capitalize on growth opportunities in a
consolidating market." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

17:59 EDT - On the face of it, the decline in Fonterra's 2014-15 payout versus the season just ending "is
a drag on the economy over the coming year," says ANZ Bank rural economist Con Williams. However,
"that dynamic is exaggerated; the coming year's payout will still be the 4th highest on record," he says.
Fonterra is forecasting it will pay its 10,500 farmers NZ$7 per kilogram of milk solids in the season
starting June 1, versus a revised NZ$8.40 in the season just ended. While NZ$8.40 has been revised
down--taking some NZ$395M out of the economy--"it only takes a little bit of cream off the top of an
otherwise stellar season," says Williams. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)
17:47 EDT - NZD/USD gets a lift from news that Fonterra Co-operative Group forecast it will pay its
10,500 farmer shareholders NZ$7.0 per kilogram of milk solids in the season that starts June 1. While
the opening forecast is sharply lower than this season's revised forecast of NZ$8.40, ANZ Bank says "it's
at the high end" of what the market was expecting. NZD/USD last at 0.8563, from 0.8541 prior to the
announcement. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

17:37 EDT - AUD/USD support of 0.9210 is holding for the time being, but if it breaks below that level
AUD will be vulnerable, says Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer. He says the Westpac Leading
index for April and 1Q construction work done will be local drivers of the currency while the Westpac-MNI
China Consumer Sentiment for May is also a must watch. The pair is at 0.9260, unchanged from late
Tuesday in Sydney. Speizer adds the downward correction being seen in the pair could run as far as
0.9000 during the weeks ahead as weak consumer sentiment a major drag. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;
