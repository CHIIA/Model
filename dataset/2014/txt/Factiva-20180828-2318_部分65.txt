Investments THE listed investment company stalwart once chaired by Don Bradman says the
markets are not all “doom and gloom” despite warning investors not to expect the returns of recent
years.

Retail investor favourite Argo Investments yesterday said there were “many positives” despite
international markets threatening to boil over due to a combination of a stagnant Europe, slowing
China and the growing Ebola threat.

Local investors looking for a glimmer of good news should look first at the falling Australian dollar as
a boost for the local economy, company chairman Ian Martin said.

“Specifically in Australia, the lower currency will also have a net stimulatory impact,’’ Mr Martin told
shareholders at Argo’s annual meeting.

It also said the “recent pull back in the market has provided some investment opportunities” and
Argo had $135 million on hand to chase opportunities.

Mr Martin yesterday told shareholders to “look through the short-term noise” as he believed the
world would “muddle along”.
Argo has a $4.9 billion investment portfolio, including Westpac, ANZ and BHP Billiton.
He said the emergence of shale oil in the US had bolstered that economy, while structural reform in
China had reduced that country’s reliance on state-owned enterprises.Managing director Jason
Beddow said equity falls had brought Australian shares closer to fair value.
