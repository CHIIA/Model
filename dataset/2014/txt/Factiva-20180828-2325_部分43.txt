2223 GMT - Highfield Resources (HFR.AU), which is developing a potash project in northern Spain,
offers 53% upside for investors betting that emerging economies such as Brazil and China will need
more fertilizer to sustain their food production, says Bell Potter. The broker has a buy call and A$0.90
price target on the stock. It says the ASX-listed company has enough cash to complete a feasibility
study into its Muga-Vipasca project around mid-2015, but will likely need to raise around A$110 million
thereafter to fund the equity component of its development. Bell Potter also adopts a more conservative
price outlook on long-term potash prices of US$300/ton, compared with Highfield's estimate of around
US$400/ton. HFR last traded at A$0.585. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2218 GMT - Australian shares are likely to continue last week's slide, with no sign worries over the pace
of global growth are letting up. U.S. stocks capped a volatile week with losses Friday, and the Dow
industrials shifted back into negative territory for the year. IG forecasts an opening fall of 1.1% for the
S&P/ASX 200 to about 5127. Trade balance data due Monday out of China will be watched closely given
concerns over a slowdown in Australia's biggest trading partner have been one of the triggers for the
sharp and sustained selling in Aussie shares, IG market strategist Evan Lucas says. BHP Billiton
(BHP.AU) shares may weaken after the U.S. ADRs fell 1.1%, although the spot iron-ore price rose 0.5%
on Friday to US$79.90/ton, IG figures show. The ASX 200 ended Friday down 2.1% at 5188.3.

2209 GMT - If investor lending in Australia loses more steam then it would relieve a key constraint to
easier monetary policy, says J.P. Morgan. "The fact that further macro-prudential measures are expected
to be announced by year-end adds to this prospect," J.P. Morgan economist Ben Jarman says. The
value of loans for investment housing in Australia fell 0.1% in August from a month earlier, slowing
sharply from a 5.6% on-month rise in July, data showed Friday. "Of course, it's still possible that foreign
investment activity keeps prices going up," Mr. Jarman says, noting that Sydney is a potential hotspot.
That would leave the Reserve Bank of Australia with the existential question of whether it should care
about rising asset prices if there is no marginal leverage associated with it. "We suspect officials would
view such a situation as outside the purview of monetary policy," Mr. Jarman says.
