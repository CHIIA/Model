0354 GMT [Dow Jones] Morgans cuts its recommendation on IT provider Legend Corp. (LGD.AU) to hold
from add following a flat FY14 outcome, but says the stock's dividend yield is attractive enough for
investors to wait for a turnaround. Challenging industry conditions in mining and construction have
resulted in limited earnings growth. Legend posted a net profit of A$6.7 million for FY14, while annual
revenue slipped 2.9%. "We prefer to wait for more evidence of earnings growth before becoming more
aggressive on the name," says Morgans analyst Scott Power. Morgans cuts its price target by 14% to
A$0.32. Legend last traded at A$0.27. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

0342 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's S&P/ASX 200 hit a fresh two-and-a-half month low of 5373.4, just shy
of key support from the July trough at 5370.9, after an early rise caused by the September index futures
expiry. The effects of higher interest rate projections from FOMC members continue to be felt, with the
U.S. dollar rising and equities falling in Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea. AUD/USD hit a fresh
6-month low, fuelling concern about "carry" trade selling by offshore investors. The S&P/ASX 200 looks
quite bearish after breaking the August low, the 200-day moving average and the uptrend line from July
2012--all in the 5420-5425 area. But short covering may see 5370.9 hold before the Scottish
independence vote. Index last down 0.4% at 5386.2. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter:

0331 GMT [Dow Jones] Companies around the world are increasingly investing in technologies used to
mine the explosion of data from sources like websites, smartphones, machines and sensors, according to
research firm Gartner. 73% of 302 organizations polled in June said they have invested in or will invest in
big data technologies over the next two years, Gartner says. That's up from 64% last year. "The most
dramatic changes are in enhancing customer experience, especially in transportation, healthcare,
insurance, media and communications, retail, and banking," said Gartner research director Lisa Kart.
Governments, manufacturing companies, and informational technology vendors are also increasingly
using such technologies, she noted. (newley.purnell@wsj.com Twitter: @newley)

0304 GMT [Dow Jones] The Malaysian ringgit weakened early Thursday as the market reacted to the
possibility that U.S. interest rates could rise at a quicker-than-expected pace. But the highlight of the day
is the impending policy decision by Bank Negara Malaysia. Analysts are split as to whether the Malaysian
central bank will raise interest rates by another quarter percentage point as they did in July. Consumer
price inflation rose 3.3% on-year according to data published on Wednesday - above analysts' forecast
for a 3.2% increase--which might make it easier for the central bank to justify an inflation-fighting rate
hike. A rate hike could help the ringgit to recoup losses against the broadly stronger U.S. dollar.
USD/MYR is now 3.2380 from its Wednesday close of 3.2160. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0304 GMT [Dow Jones] Data released by the Bank of Japan Thursday show that cash and deposit
holdings by Japanese firms increased 4.2% in the three months to June from a year earlier to Y229
trillion. "There's no change in firms' stance of keeping cash liquidity high at hand," says a BOJ official.
Meanwhile, "companies are not fully maintaining conservative stances," the official said, referring to
figures including one related to their direct investment overseas, which rose 13.6% on year.

0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia's short-term offshore borrowings is growing faster than its long-term
borrowings. Bank Indonesia's data shows corporate short-term offshore borrowing grew 11.1% on-year in
July, compared with 7.3% in June. Economists say the faster growth was due mostly to an increase in
corporate short-term offshore borrowings for working capital. "The huge amount of short-term offshore
borrowings eventually will put pressure on the current-account and the rupiah," says Bank Internasional
Indonesia (BNII.JK) economist Juniman. He urges the government and Bank Indonesia to slow corporate
Indonesia's offshore borrowing to avoid sliding into a similar situation seen during the 1997-98 Asian
financial crisis, where huge offshore borrowing made the country's corporate sector vulnerable to
external shocks. (i-made.sentana@wsj.com)

0254 GMT [Dow Jones] The euro is displaying a buoyant tone against the Swiss franc in Asian trade
Thursday ahead of the Swiss National Bank's interest rate decision due at 0730 GMT. The SNB is
expected to maintain its floor of CHF1.20 per euro and keep interest rates unchanged. Dow Jones
technical analysis shows EUR/CHF short-term technical outlook is positive as the rate-of-change
momentum indicator is advancing in positive territory, the daily Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence and slow stochastic indicators are bullish, while the five-day moving average is
above the 15-day moving average and advancing. A rise above the 55-day moving average, now at
1.2119, would open the way up to the 100-day moving average, now at 1.2150, and then to the July 30
reaction high of 1.2177. But the EUR/CHF would jump a few centimes if the SNB unexpectedly follows
the European Central Bank in cutting rates to negative. Spot EUR/CHF is at 1.2107 versus 1.2098 late
Wednesday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0251 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/TWD rises to an over four-and-a-half-month high, reflecting the
greenback's broad gains against most currencies after the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, in which the
Fed forecast a faster pace of rate increases in 2015 and 2016. The USD/TWD is at 30.225, off its earlier
high of 30.248, but still higher than 30.134 late Wednesday. The USD/TWD is mostly pushed up by
foreign investor buying, two local traders say. A trader says the pair pares some earlier gains due to
exporter sales, "but the U.S. dollar is still likely to advance further if foreign investors continue to buy," he
adds, and tips the pair to find initial resistance at 30.250. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0237 GMT [Dow Jones] A commodities forecaster with the Australian government tips iron-ore prices to
average $90-$95/ton over the next five years, after falling sharply on an Aussie-led supply surge. Iron
ore has fallen around 37% this year, to US$84/ton. "Prices are softening as a result of a substantial
supply response", which included an extra 200 million tons of material from Australia over the past 12
months, says Wayne Calder, executive director of the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics, a
research arm of Australia's Department of Industry. There is still more supply to come on, but likely at a
slower rate. Bree tips another 100 million tons from Australia, and a similar level from Brazil, in the next
couple of years. Meanwhile, "we don't see any inadequacy in demand", Calder says. Still, he
acknowledges the market is likely to remain choppy. "It is a volatile commodity, and sometimes we see
swings in excess of US$30/ton through the cycle," he says. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter:

0230 GMT [Dow Jones] The gradual move towards U.S. monetary tightening has allowed the Australian
dollar to resume its downtrend which is likely to take it down to $US0.8000 over the next year or two,
says Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. A fall in the Australian dollar "is necessary to deal
with Australia's high cost base and weakening export prices," he says. Roughly speaking each 10% fall in
the Australian dollar adds about 3% to earnings. The Australian dollar is now at US$0.8963.

0230 GMT [Dow Jones] China's home prices will likely continue to slip until the first half of 2015, but
property sales might be able to rebound toward the end of this year, thanks to local government support
measures, Macquarie Group's Larry Hu says. "It's quite likely the government will roll out targeted rate
cuts, such as lowering mortgage rates for first-time home buyers, in the last quarter," Hu says, adding
that the chance of a universal rate cut is slim. Property investment growth is expected to drop to about
11%-12% at the end of the year from around 13%, he adds. The average price of new homes in 70 cities
fell for the fourth straight month in August, declining 1.10% from July, compared with a 0.89% on-month
fall in July. (liyan.qi@wsj.com)

0229 GMT [Dow Jones] Crude oil futures inched down in early Asian trading hours. Nymex crude fell 51
cents to $93.91 per barrel after U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose suddenly in the week ending Sep. 12, while
Brent crude fell 47 cents to $98.5 per barrel on continued supply pressure. (biman.mukherji@wsj.com)

0645 GMT [Dow Jones] The Thai government plans to propose a new law on inheritance tax to
parliament first, as it is expected to face less resistance, says Deputy Prime Minister Pridiyathorn
Devakula. "Many millionaires I spoke to are willing to pay 10% for their inheritance. Some countries
collect 33% or 50% on that," Mr. Pridiyathorn says. The junta-backed government is considering
restructuring the country's tax system and introducing new taxes on land ownership and inheritance. But
land tax is more complicated and requires studies. (warangkana.chomchuen@wsj.com)

0633 GMT [Dow Jones] Thailand's deputy prime minister says China suggests restarting a bilateral
meeting to further expand trade and investment between the two countries. The meeting, to be held in
Beijing, will focus on Thai exports to China, especially of rice and rubber, says Deputy Prime Minister
Pridiyathorn Devakula. Beijing also wants to discuss its investment plan in Thailand. Thai exports to
China have grown to 12% from 2% in the past 15 years, Mr. Pridiyathorn says. "We can count on
China," he says. The absence of criticism from China regarding Thailand's political situation also shows
that Beijing is "a good friend," he adds. The last trade meeting was over 10 years ago, but the timing of
the new meeting hasn't been decided. (warangkana.chomchuen@wsj.com)

0630 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY is gaining momentum, with speculative investors and imorters
buying the dollar. The move similar to what market participants saw in the rally between last autumn and
early this year, says Minori Uchida, head of Tokyo global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ. But the USD/JPY's ongoing upward momentum "could be much stronger than last year, buoyed by
the USD strength across the board", Uchida says. In this latest rally, unfolding since mid-August, the
USD/JPY has so far gained about Y7, or 7%. In comparison, during the rally last year, the USD/JPY
gained about Y9 to climb above 105 through January this year. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

0630 GMT [Dow Jones] China doesn't need strong stimulus as long as economic growth is still within the
government's targeted range, says the central bank's advisor Chen Yulu in an interview with the official
Financial News. Chen says China's economic growth is expected to face more downward pressure in the
fourth quarter, so the monetary policy mini-stimulus should continue. But mini-stimulus should not turn
into strong stimulus. Chen's remark came after China's central bank reportedly was injecting a combined
500 billion yuan ($81 billion) of liquidity into the country's top five banks, triggering speculation that
Beijing was stepping up its efforts to bolster the cooling economy. (grace.zhu@wsj.com)

0622 GMT [Dow Jones] The U.S. dollar trades at a fresh six-year high against the yen Thursday after the
Federal Reserve outlined a steeper path for interest rates. USD/JPY trades at 108.790, after touching a
peak of 108.87, according to CQG. Ahead of the Scottish independence vote, the GBP/USD remains
rangebound at 1.6305. Polls opened at 0600 GMT and close at 2100 GMT. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0616 GMT [Dow Jones] India's credit growth is likely to pick up from October onwards as industrial
activity shows signs of improvement, says Upasna Bhardwaj, economist with ING Vysya Bank. The
Indian banking sector's loan growth slipped below 10% for the first time in five years in the fortnight
ending September 5, according to Reserve Bank of India data. "Alternative modes of finance, like
corporate bond issuance, too are seeing a pick-up with more interest from foreign investors," says
Bhardwaj. "Industrial activity typically picks up from late September and continues for the rest of the
year." (nupur.acharya@wsj.com)

0613 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares of Hyundai Motor Co. (005380.SE) fell 9.6% to 197,000 won after the
company said it clinched a 10.55 trillion won ($10.19 billion) bid over Samsung Electronics Co.
(005930.SE) for a plot of land in Seoul. Hyundai wants to build a global business center on the site. IBK
Securities analyst Hong Jin-ho says Hyundai's bid was too high and it won't lead to improved earnings.
"There's nothing investors can benefit from the company's purchase of the land. With that money,
Hyundai could have built almost 10 car-manufacturing plants," he says. Hyundai Mobis (012330.SE),
which owns 26% of Hyundai Motor, is off 7.9% at 257,000 won. The broader market is down 0.7%.

0612 GMT [Dow Jones]--While negative rates are undoubtedly a weapon it can use to curb demand for
the franc, the Swiss National Bank is unlikely to make use of it at today's review of monetary policy,
according to Commerzbank. "Today's outcome will be no different from previous meetings, when the
SNB has stressed the importance of defending its minimum exchange for the euro-franc," says analyst
Ulrich Leuchtmann. The SNB rate decision is due at 0730 GMT. EUR/CHF was last at 1.2109.

the GBP/JPY strength, says a senior trader at a Japanese bank. It is unclear what is causing the GBP
buying but "could be tied to speculation over Scotland's independence vote," says the trader. The
EUR/JPY is now at 140.01, highest since June 9, against 139.33 late Wednesday in New York.

0558 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares rebound for the second session, closing 0.5% higher at 9237.03;
but low volumes at NT$69.04 billion (vs. NT$82.19 billion Wednesday) suggest the Taiex's recent
downtrend is far from over. Most Apple suppliers extend gains: Hon Hai (2317.TW) adds 1.0% to
NT$102.00, TSMC (2330.TW) is up 0.4% at NT$125.00 and Largan (3008.TW) rises 0.4% to
NT$2,360.00. First Capital says investors' nerves are soothed as the Federal Reserve shows caution
about tightening too fast, lending support to equities in general. The brokerage says the next
market-moving news will be the referendum in Scotland; it expects the Taiex to hover in 9014-9360 band
Friday. (aries.poon@wsj.com)

0550 GMT [Dow Jones] When even Japanese auto executives start voicing uneasiness about the yen's
decline, who is left to support it? After decades of pushing for a weak yen to help prop up exports,
Japan's main auto lobby appears to be shifting its view as the yen hits its lowest level against the U.S.
dollar in six years. "It's hard to say without reservation that yen weakness is all good," said Fumihiko Ike,
head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and chairman of Honda Motor Co. at a
Thursday news conference. "The auto industry generally sees the phase of yen weakening positively, but
rapid moves are not desirable," he said, citing the post-Fukushima rise in energy-import costs. Indeed,
having shifted much of their production overseas, auto makers see fewer benefits from a weak yen.
Honda's vehicle exports from Japan fell 74% from a year earlier during the January to July period, even
as its global production rose 10%. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com)
