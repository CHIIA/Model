Victoria, Australia--After years of speculation, it looks like Australia's troubled Treasury Wine Estates may
get a new owner.
Private equity groupKKR & Co. LP teamed up with Rhone Capital to make a $3,4 billion bid (all figures
in Australian dollars unless otherwise noted) for the publicly traded company, then TPG Capital
Management LP matched the move, sending Treasury stock above the offering price of $5.20 per share
to $5.33 per share.

Treasury had rejected an earlier, lower offer of $2.9 billion ($4.70 per share) by KKR in May. China's
Bright Food Group was also interested but dropped out of the bidding, while another private equity fund,
the Carlyle Group, was rumored to be placing a bid at press time.
With at least two bidders fighting over the world's largest publicly owned pure-play wine company, a deal
seems likely.

The industry has expected a takeover of Treasury since late 2013.
Foster's Brewery spun out its wine assets in 2011 to form Treasury Wine Estates before it was in turn
taken over by SABMiller.

While St. Helena,. Calif.-based Beringer Vineyards was highly profitable before being acquired by
Foster's, the U.S. operations in particular have suffered since then, and overall company profit dropped
38% in the six months ended in February. The company has warned of more losses ahead.

An Aug. 21 report should detail the impact of oversupply in Treasury's U.S. operations.
On June 25 the company said it would take a write-down of as much as $260 million for the year ending
June 30 as a result of overpayments for previous acquisitions, slowing sales of Cheap wine and write-offs
of brands and property.
Its sales in China also have plummeted because of a government crackdown on luxury gifts. Interestingly,
KKR owns part of VATS Liquor Chain Store Management, China's largest distributor of alcoholic
beverages.
Though troubled, Treasury seems an attractive target for the right buyer. For one, it has $2 billion in tax
credits, partly resulting in a write-down of the value of its U.S. operations from the $2.9 billion paid in
2000 to today's estimated value of $900 million.
It's widely assumed that a buyer would reorganize the company and sell off assets including brands and
property--or even split it geographically or between high-end and high-volume operations.
The company has 83 brands including some strong ones like Beringer (California), Pen-folds (Australia),
Lindemans (Australia), Wolf Blass (Australia), Chateau St. jean (California) and Greg Norman (Argentina,
Australia and California).

Its other U.S. brands include Cellar No. 8 and Souverain in California's Sonoma County, and Stags' Leap
Winery, Etude, St. Clement and Sledgehammer in Napa County, Calif.

One possible issue for bidder TPG is U.S. tied-house laws. The large private equity fund owns Caesar's
Entertainment, formerly Harrah's. U.S. and California regulations generally prohibit owners of alcoholic
beverage producers from holding retail alcohol licenses.
lt would be ironic if TPG is successful, for it sold Beringer to Foster's Group in 2000 for $2.56 billion.
TPG .(then called Texas Pacific Group)., along with Napa-based wine investment firm Silverado
Partners, bought the Beringer wine business from Swiss consumer goods companyNestle SA for $350
million (USD) in 1996..

Goldman Sachs is advising Treasury, while Nomura Holdings is reportedly advising the KKR-Rhone
consortium.
