Australian shares notched up a seventh consecutive session of modest gains after recovering from an
afternoon slump led by a sell-off in iron ore and coalminers. The market was buoyed by excitement
surrounding a foreign takeover bid for bread and margarine maker Goodman Fielder.
In the morning session, local shares pushed higher, defying a weak lead from equity markets around
the United States and Europe, before slumping amid weak Asian trade in the afternoon and rallying at
the close to finish flat.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index edged up 5.1 points, or 0.1 per cent, on Monday to 5536.1, while
the broader All Ordinaries Index eked out a gain of just 0.01 per cent to 5516.1. Three of the big four
banks are at record highs as investors continue to pile in ahead of dividend season next month.

Global investors are focused on the US this week amid anticipation the Federal Reserve will continue
to taper its monthly bond-buying program by another $US10 billion when its meeting concludes on
Thursday, and that improving US employment and housing data could point to interest rates
normalising earlier than forecast.

"How quickly inflation returns to the Fed's 2 per cent target will have a major bearing on the likely
trajectory of its quantitative easing program, the US Fed Funds rate, US 10-year Treasury yields and,
in turn, global asset prices," Magellan Asset Management portfolio manager Dom Giuliano said.Banks,

The biggest banks were all higher on Monday ahead of the start of bank reporting season. ANZ
Banking Group added 0.8 per cent to a record high $34.94, amid expectations it will announce an
81¢-per-share interim dividend when it reports on Thursday. Credit Suisse analysts are tipping ANZ to
be the "standout" of the commercial bank reporting season.

Westpac Banking Corporation rose 0.2 per cent to a record high $35.86, while National Australia Bank
gained 0.5 per cent to a seven-month high of $35.99 ahead of reporting interim results next week.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which will reveal its third-quarter results next month, gained 0.7 per
cent to an all-time high $79.45. Investment bank Macquarie Group was also higher ahead of reporting
its full-year results on Friday, up 1 per cent at $57.10.

"The fair expectation of healthy dividends mean the bank stocks are still attractive to hold, despite
prices being stretched to over-valued, but I wouldn't be adding them at the moment," Australian Ethical
portfolio manager Andy Gracey said.
Packaged foods groupGoodman Fielder was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing
15.5 per cent to 63.5¢ after rejecting a 65¢-per-share foreign takeover offer.

Groceries was the best-performing sector, up 1 per cent, as Woolworths lifted 2 per cent to a record
high of $38.49. Rival Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, dipped 0.1 per cent to $43.89 ahead of delivering

show 5.3 per cent growth. Mr Simotas has a "sell" recommendation on the retailer, with a target price
of $38.
Telco giant Telstra Corporation gained 0.4 per cent at $5.20.Gold lining to miners' woes
Mining was the worst-performing sector, down 0.8 per cent, as the spot price for iron ore, landed in
China, fell 1.9 per cent to a month low of $US111 a tonne and coking coal prices traded at a six-year
low. Resources giant BHP Billiton lost 1.1 per cent to $37.87 as it was reported former Xstrata boss
Mick Davis, via his new private equity vehicle X2 Resources, is seeking up to $US8 billion
($8.6 billion) in debt from JPMorgan to purchase BHP's thermal coal division.
Rio Tinto shed 1.5 per cent to $62.06, while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group dropped 4.1 per
cent to $5.12.
Australia's biggest oil producer, Woodside Petroleum, rose 0.4 per cent to $41.08 after its potential
US partner in the giant Israeli Leviathan gas venture, Noble Energy, said it would proceed without it.
Woodside missed a March 27 deadline to complete its purchase of 24 per cent of the gas field.
Pharmaceutical company Acrux was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200, slumping 33.2 per
cent to $1.11 after warning shareholders it was likely to miss targets due to sales of its lead product,
the testosterone replacement treatment Axiron, being hurt by a US Food and Drug Administration
investigation into a possible link between the treatment and increased risk of heart attack or stroke.
"Acrux is down but not out," said Mr Gracey, who holds the company and met with its management
on Monday. "Although investors wanting to buy it on the dip should be prepared to be patient, as the
FDA investigation will likely take a year."
