* Australian company, Ausin Group, predicts $1.5 billion in sales from Chinese buyers in the next
financial year

* Value of mortgages is also expected to increase to $500 million in 2015

* Chinese buyers spend on average $630,000 on new Australian properties
* Average loan amount is $440,000 or 70 percent of property's value
The Chinese rush to buy homes in Australia is here to stay with a broker company expecting to sell
two-thirds more homes and double the amount of loans as demand from China increases.
Ausin Group, which offers property and mortgage broking in Australia to Chinese investors, has
predicted $1.5 billion in sales of new residential properties in the next financial year, compared to
$900 million in the last year.  

The value of mortgages is also expected to increase to $500 million in the 2015 calender year, the
company's Sydney-based managing director, Joseph Zaja, said.  

'I don't see the trend slowing down. It's here to stay,' Mr Zaja told the Sydney Morning Herald.
The company markets local developers like Stockland and Mirvac through its 11 offices in China,
with the average price the Chinese spend on properties in Australia resting at about $630,000.
Mr Zaja said Ausin only started offering mortgage brokering service to Chinese clients last year and
they now organise home loans through Australian banks for 93 percent of its buyers.
The average loan borrowing amount is roughly $440,000, or 70 per cent of a property's value.
The company has sold more than 1,200 properties across Australia's east coast and in New Zealand
in the last year.
Mr Zaja said property sales included a mixture of inner city apartments and house and land
packages located 20-40km from various CBDs.
'Australia is considered a safe property investment haven with solid returns and is a preferred
immigration destination,' he told Property Observer.
Concern over foreign investment driving up Australian property prices and prompted a parliamentary
inquiry into overseas buying of real estate.

The inquiry's findings is expected to be released in October.
