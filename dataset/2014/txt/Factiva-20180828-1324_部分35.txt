2306 GMT [Dow Jones] Iron-ore prices dip amid expectations mine supply will continue to swell. "BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP.AU) production figures show the Australian supply response has been particularly
aggressive, despite falling prices," ANZ analysts write in a daily note. Total output from BHP's Australian
mines rose 20% in FY14 to 225 million tons. According to The Steel Index, ore with 62% iron content
fell 1.2% Wednesday to $94.30/ton. It's down 3.8% on a week ago. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter:

2304 GMT [Dow Jones] NZ June goods trade surplus narrowed due to softness in timber and dairy
prices. Statistics New Zealand says the country recorded a NZ$247 million ($214.2 million) surplus vs.
expectations of a NZ$200 million surplus. Furthermore, the data highlighted softening exports with
China with exports down 1.5% on the same month a year ago. The data supports comments from the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler earlier that a fall in prices for exports of dairy
and timber were going to reduce incomes in the primary sector. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter:

22:58 GMT [Dow Jones] Retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico's measures to remedy underperformance at Sam's
Club membership stores are likely to take time to take effect, says Barclays. "Even though the company
has taken actions to improve issues at Sam's Club, we do not foresee any major benefits from those
changes to happen in the short term as the economic environment in Mexico should remain challenging,"
the bank adds in keeping its neutral rating on the stock. Walmex reported 2Q sales up 5.6% on year,
Ebitda up 5.6%, and net profit up 2.5% excluding a one-time gain from the sale of its restaurants.
Barclays notes that excluding Sam's, Walmex sales rose 7.6%, outperforming its competitors.

2253 GMT [Dow Jones] BHP Billiton Ltd.'s (BHP.AU) metallurgical coal output is seen rising, with a 4%
lift expected in FY15 as Caval Ridge ramps up. Still, weakness in coal prices and restructuring charges
mean the division would have only been marginally EBIT positive in 2H14, says Credit Suisse. It says
Wednesday's strong FY14 production result was underpinned by strength in its Australian iron-ore unit.
Its petroleum division is also performing well, and in FY15 should "be strongly EBIT positive," the bank
adds. Credit Suisse retains a neutral rating on the stock with a A$38.00 ($35.67) price target. BHP's
Australian shares last traded at A$38.98. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

18:49 EDT -- Could New York residents and visitors find themselves without Jamba (JMBA) Juice? They
might if they don't drink more and an activist shareholder gets its way. Engaged Capital disclosed a 7%
stake in JMBA and says it will seek talks about cost cuts and "eliminating the earnings drag from the
Issuer's unprofitable New York City locations." Activist also says the juice company could refranchise "a
significant portion" of its locations to boost stock value. JMBA has 854 global stores, 263 of which it
owns. It pointed to NYC weather for dragging on margins in its first quarter. JMBA flat YTD after rising
2.1% Wednesday. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit)

2248 GMT [Dow Jones] Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) success in the cloud ultimately will depend on whether
it can master the intricacies of service and support that the new technology requires, CIOs say. Melding
public clouds with private IT infrastructure often requires a high-degree of integration and high-grade
support. That's a top priority for CIOs and an area in which Microsoft with its massive sales and support
infrastructure, has an opportunity to try and distinguish itself. The biggest challenge for Microsoft will be
"tuning" clouds for customer needs, Ravinder Pal Singh, global CIO of Air Works Engineering Private

Page85of234©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Ltd., told CIO Journal. Barry Brunetto, VP for information systems at Blount International Inc., says
Microsoft, given their tools and expertise, should be able to make changes before their clients see a
downgrade in service. "This is what cloud companies should do, tuning is a constant activity when usage
grows." Microsoft's hybrid cloud strategy already is showing some signs of traction. The company
reported commercial cloud services revenue grew 147% in the quarter ended June 30.

2244 GMT [Dow Jones] Business-to-consumer e-commerce sales are expected to grow almost 20% to
$1.471 trillion in 2014, according to new figures from eMarketer released today. North America is
expected to remain the sales leader in 2014, accounting for about a third of dollars spent on digital
purchases globally. eMarketer said earlier that it expected Asia-Pacific to surpass North America in sales
this year, but full-year 2013 data and Q1 2014 numbers showed slower growth in the region than
originally expected. Asia-Pacific is now expected to become the leading region for e-commerce sales in
2015, tied to a growing base of digital buyers coming online. China alone will make up more than half of
all the region's e-commerce sales this year, and its share will top 70% by 2018, eMarketer said.

18:32 EDT - A high level of uncertainty about what the sustainable level of earnings at Coca-Cola Amatil
(CCL.AU) actually is outweighs the potential the company has to find additional savings and the quality
and well-capitalized nature of its asset base, says JPMorgan. The brokerage is waiting for possible
preliminary findings from a strategic review when the company releases its interim results, due August
20. In the meantime, it trims its forecasts for normalized EPS by 9.8% in 2014, by 14.3% in 2015 and by
14.2% in 2016. It retains a neutral stance but cuts its price target to A$10.10/share from A$10.30.

2225 GMT - JPMorgan remains neutral on BHP Billiton (BHP BHP.AU), arguing the stock looks to be
around fair value despite a higher target price and strong fiscal 2015 guidance from the company. The
target rises to A$41/share from A$39. JPMorgan notes the company's guidance for FY15 Pilbara
iron-ore production of 245M tons is in line with the run rate for output in the June quarter and could
prove conservative. Guidance for petroleum production was relatively soft, however, and BHP has
flagged one-off charges of US$900M-US$1.3B that will hit FY14 underlying earnings. BHP last traded at
A$38.98. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
18:22 EDT - Right now, there's no single, definitive standard for reporting a company's ecological
footprint or sustainability practices. But as stricter government regulations in Europe and elsewhere force
companies to make disclosures about their ecological and economic impact, sustainability reporting is
becoming a bigger concern for corporate bosses. The Global Reporting Initiative, a nonprofit that aims to
make companies' sustainability reports as standard as their financial reports, this week tapped Michael
Meehan, served as CEO of iVeridis Corporation, to both lead efforts in getting companies of all sizes to
account for their sustainability and collaborate with other groups pushing their own standards to measure
sustainability. (nikki.waller@wsj.com)

18:11 EDT - The RBNZ "took a very clear thump at the NZD, and initially has been very successful in
knocking it down," says ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley. The central bank's use of the word
"unjustified" in relation to the kiwi's strength is seen "as a tick in the box for the RBNZ justifying
intervention," he says. While Tuffley does not expect the RBNZ to intervene despite the comments, "the
statement changes should keep the NZD heavy in the near term." NZD/USD at 0.8620.
(rebecca.howard@wsj.com; @FarroHoward)

18:04 EDT - The fourth 25-bps rate hike to New Zealand's cash rate since March may not have caught
too many investors off guard, but RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler's message sure did. His comment
that the kiwi's current strength was "unjustified" and "unsustainable" and "with potential for a significant
fall," came packaged in some strident language, says Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at
Westpac Bank. "People will read that as a veiled threat for intervention," he says. "For a currency that
was supported by the RBNZ, and testing multi-decade highs a short while ago, that was a dramatic
about-face." NZD down 0.9% at US$0.8619. (james.ramage@wsj.com)
