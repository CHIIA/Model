Tourism Accommodation Australia has welcomed the Federal Government's handling of the tourism
sector in the 2014 Budget, in particular the announcement of the new Tourism Demand Driver
Infrastructure grants program with the States

The managing director of Tourism Accommodation Australia, Rodger Powell, said following the
release of the Commission of Audit report, TAA called on the government to ignore the
recommendations relating to tourism marketing and to increase net spending on tourism, because of
its potential to boost export earnings and create sustainable jobs.

"We are pleased the government has maintained Tourism Australia's resources, as they have
demonstrated considerable success in growing the inbound market in recent years. We also welcome
the allocation of additional funding for marketing efforts in Asian growth markets, with Chinese
visitors expected to generate over $13 billion in tourism revenue by 2020," Mr Powell said.
This comes as the Sofitel Wentworth Sydney, was sold to the Singaporean Frasers Centrepoint's,
Frasers property group, for $202.7 million.
Agents say the deal was the start of the next wave of Asian investors into the hotel and tourism
sector.
The sale, which it is said will be used as a seed asset for a new real estate investment trust, will
augur well for the sale of the Sheraton on the Park that was recently put on the market. Located in
Elizabeth Street, opposite Hyde Park, the hotel is worth about $250 million.
The seller of the two hotels is LaSalle Investment Management, through McVay Real Estate and
Craig Collins of JLL's Hotels and Hospitality Group. Accor Asia will remain as the manager of the
Sofitel Wentworth.

Wayne Bunz, senior director of CBRE Hotels Australia, said he is in due diligence for about $70
million of hotels in Sydney.

"Hotels offer a solid, long-term yield and these investors are long term holders of assets," he said.
"At the end of the manager's lease the hotel owners can then look at redeveloping the properties into
apartments."
Across Sydney there has been a rash of big ticket hotel sales including the Four Seasons Sydney
Hotel, to Korea's Mirae Asset Global Investments for a reported $340 million.

As well, the NSW government is selling the former "Sandstone" Department of Lands building and
Department of Education building on Bridge Street to a hotel or tourism style operator.

In the past six months more than $150 million has also changed hands in Melbourne hotels, which
experts said was an indication of a busy year ahead.

significant foray into local property with the purchase of Melbourne's landmark Park Hyatt hotel.

It is thought the price paid was about $135 million, but the agents and buyer declined to comment.
