DAIRY SALE
UNITED Dairy Power is expected to be sold within days to a company with origins in Hong
Kong.

The Weekly Times understands a successful transaction could also result in UDP's 165 suppliers
receiving a financial bonus as a result of the sale.

UDP managing director Tony Esposito would not confirm the sale or details surrounding the
speculation.
But he highlighted the key role dairy farmers had played in the success of UDP.
``If we do a deal, then yes, I've always said without farmers there is no business,'' Mr Esposito
said.

``Yes, I would give them a financial bonus.''
Mr Esposito said UDP had been working closely with parties to bring the company to the next
level of growth.
UDP is Australia's sixth largest dairy processor and collects about 275 million litres of milk a
year.

It has processing plants in South Australia and Victoria.

Evidence UDP was on the market first surfaced more than a year ago though documents called
``Project Southbank'' seen by The Weekly Times.
At the time, the company said the documents were about capital raising.
UDP general manager Darryl Cardona has denied the suitor was China's Bright Food Group.
