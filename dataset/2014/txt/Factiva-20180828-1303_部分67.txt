RIO Tinto has more than doubled its half-year net profit to $US4.4 billion ($A4.76 billion).

The world’s second largest miner’s profit was below consensus analyst expectations of $US4.57
billion.

The result was an improvement on a $US1.7 billion net profit in the first half of last year.
Underlying earnings, which strips out $US843 million in one-off impairment charges, was up 21 per
cent to $US5.1 billion.

Chief executive Sam Walsh said the result was outstanding considering weaker commodity prices.
Iron ore earnings of $US4.7 billion dominated the result, but the biggest profit growth came in
aluminium and copper, with 74 per cent and 71 per cent rises respectively. Rio Tinto’s interim
dividend of US96¢ a share is up 15 per cent from a year ago, in line with expectations. Iron ore
earnings were up 10 per cent on the previous year.
The next largest contributor to earnings was copper, followed by the long troubled aluminium division.
The energy division, which includes coal and uranium, improved to a $US19 million loss.
That comes in the wake of Rio’s disastrous $US4 billion-plus loss on the sale of its coal assets in
Mozambique. The company’s net debt reduced by $US1.9 billion in the six months to $US16.1
billion.

Mr Walsh said he was confident of the long-term fundamentals of demand for its products, while
recognising the changing nature of China’s economic development.

“Global GDP growth in 2014 is expected to exceed 3 per cent which will support commodity demand,”
he said.
“The Chinese Government is dealing effectively with the rebalancing of its economy, with its desired
GDP growth of 7.5 per cent in 2014 on target.” China is Rio’s key iron ore market and Mr Walsh said
high-cost iron-ore producers were exiting the market, leaving Rio well placed.

Extra supply through large expansions of major mines has led to predictions of over-supply and falling
iron ore prices.
