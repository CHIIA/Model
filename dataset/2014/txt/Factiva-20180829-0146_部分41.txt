With the background of the drop in the value of coal assets arising from the coal export market remaining
in the long-term doldrums, the takeover of coal assets in Australia by China, South Korea and India has
been intensified.
As reported earlier, on January 20, Kingho Energy Group, China acquired the majority shares in
Carabella Resources Limited through the takeover bid (TOB) and took control of this company.

As a result, Kingho Energy took possession of such coal assets owned by Carabella Resources as Bluff
project and Grosvenor West project in the State of QLD.
Incidentally, Kingho Energy has a 71.10% shareholding in Carabella Resources at the moment.
Furthermore on 19 December 2013, Baosteel Group Corporation additionally acquired 4.6% (19 million
shares) of shares in Aquila Resources Limited. Accordingly, Baosteel's shareholding in Aquila Resources
rose to 19.79% from 15.20%.

Baosteel as a main shareholder of Aquila Resources will indirectly help Eagle Downs project and
Washpool project driven by Aquila Resources in QLD.
What's more, China Qinfa Group Limited will provide A$3.6 million in seed money for Paragon
metallurgical coal project driven by Tiaro Coal Limited, Australia in QLD and purchase more interests in
this project.
In return for providing seed money, China Qinfa will be able to acquire a total of 23.8% additional interest
in Paragon metallurgical coal project from Tiaro Coal. After completion of acquisition of interests, China
Qinfa's interest holding will be raised to 40.5%.
On the other hand, in December 2013, a South Korean firm, SK Networks Co., Ltd. purchased newly
issued shares in Cockatoo Coal Limited for A$50 million, and raised its shareholding to 25.8% from
6.3%.
SK Networks will go ahead with Baralaba coal mine expansion project, etc. in QLD in cooperation with
shareholders of Cockatoo Coal such as Noble Group Limited, Hongkong.

Meanwhile, among Indian firms, in October 2013, Jindal Steel and Power Limited raised its shareholding
in Gujarat NRE Coking Coal Limited (GNM) to 53.63% and took control of GNM.
Jindal Steel intends to work on the rationalization of NRE No.1 Mine and NRE Wongawilli coal mine as an
existing coal mine in the Illawarra region through GNM in the future.
