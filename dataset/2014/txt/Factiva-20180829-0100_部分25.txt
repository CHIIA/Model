QCG Resources will test the Australian market’s rediscovered appetite for nickel stocks with a $60
million initial public offering after its April purchase of the mothballed Avebury nickel mine in
Tasmania.

The price of nickel last week soared to its highest levels in two years, pushing $US20,000 a tonne on
Friday, and QCG managing director Chris Daws said the timing of the acquisition of Avebury from
China’s MMG could not have been better. Although the deal was formally signed in mid-April, Mr
Daws said QCG and MMG committed to the sale late last year, before nickel began a bull run with a
price surge of more than 50 per cent in 2014.

QCG will pay about $40 million for Avebury. It has already handed over a $1.75 million deposit and
will pay another $33.25 million to close the purchase, plus two $2.5 million tranches for each of the
first 10,000t production milestones reached.
Internal MMG figures had put Avebury’s re-start costs at only $3.8 million but Mr Daws said QCG
plans to spend $20 million to $25 million on minor refurbishments. That included modifications to the
processing plant to add a circuit to filter out arsenic that had posed a barrier to the production of a
high-grade 20 to 23 per cent nickel concentrate.

But Mr Daws said the as-new facility was still a bargain, given its previous owners had sunk more than
$250 million into building a mine that was closed within six months of opening, having processed only
400,000t of ore. Mr Daws said MMG’s exploration team had also done considerable work at Avebury
since acquiring it from OZ Minerals in 2009.

“There’s about a 50 per cent improvement in the resources since Zinifex had it back in 2008,” he said.
“They spoke about the ease with which they put those on, and there’s significant resource potential
still at the site.”

In a top-of-the-market offer that raised eyebrows even in the heady days of early 2008, Zinifex paid
$852 million for Avebury developer Allegiance Mining as part of its efforts to diversify away from its
core zinc mining business, launching a hostile bid only months before announcing its ill-fated tie-up
with Oxiana to create OZ Minerals. The Zinifex managing director then was Andrew Michelmore, now
the boss at MMG.

Avebury opened later that year, but was shut down within six months, as nickel prices plunged below
$US10,000/t in February 2009, at the height of the GFC.
QCG is yet to announce the pricing of its float, or how much of the company will be offered to the
public. Mr Daws said the IPO documents were still being prepared and he hoped QCG would be
trading on the Australian bourse by September or October.
