Indian sandalwood producer TFS Corporation is eyeing lucrative markets in China after making a
record profit of $85.5 million.

TFS’s profit jumped 48 per cent in 2013-14 after the signing of a supply deal with Nestle-owned
dermatology companyGalderma, which set a price of $4500/kg for Indian sandalwood oil.

The company also increased its ownership of plantations by 52 per cent to 3167ha and celebrated
the first commercial harvest of plantations on the Ord River irrigation scheme planted under
managed investment schemes.
Profit was up based on a huge jump in the book value of its plantation assets from $12.47 million
to $63.3 million.
TFS managing director Frank Wilson expects strong demand from China, India and Europe for
both wood and oil in addition to supplying Galderma.
“China is potentially our biggest and best market for both wood and oil,” he said. “We just need to
wait until supply of sandalwood from our plantations gives us the ability to deliver.”
TFS expects its first sale of oil into China this year to fetch more than $5000/kg for use in
traditional medicines, skin care products and air fresheners.

Mr Wilson said that within two years the harvest of bigger and better trees would see heartwood
sold into China for up to $200,000 a tonne for use in furniture and other premium products.
TFS recently paid about $2.7 million at tender for wood produced by MIS growers involved in its
first commercial harvest. The 180t of wood is estimated to contain about 27t of heartwood suitable
for oil extraction.

There were six other bidders for the wood, including Indian, Middle East and domestic interests,
with the next best offer coming in at about $92,000/t for the heartwood compared with $100,000/kg
from TFS.
Mr Wilson said the sale would result in growers making a small pre-tax, pre-borrowing return in a
rarity for MIS projects.

“I think this year has been a turning point for TFS because we have finally moved into harvesting
and production and sale of end products,” he said.
“From now on our profits are going to be much more dependent on the sale of sandalwood end
products — wood and oil — than they are on sale of financial products to our investors.”

its own right. It wants to develop up to 15,000ha of new plantations over time and is targeting land
in the Northern Territory and around the Ord.

TFS shares closed down 1¢ yesterday at $1.985.
