Gas giant BG Group should expect three bids for its $US4 billion-plus Queensland gas pipeline, after
heavyweight infrastructure buyer Cheung Kong was a late withdrawal from the auction.

It is understood Cheung Kong representatives and their lending group recently stopped working on the
deal, after realising it was unlikely to be able to compete with rival offers.

That leaves ASX-listed APA Group ; local infrastructure fund IFM Investors and partner QIC Ltd ; and
AMP Capital with China Investment Corporation , the $US200 billion sovereign wealth fund, in the
running for the pipeline.

The three groups are expected to send their offers to BG adviser Goldman Sachs on Friday morning,
before a preferred bid is anointed and approval is sought from the UK giant's partner, CNOOC Group .

Bidders expect a deal could be signed within a fortnight and may be ready to close early in the new
year.

Up for grabs is BG's 540-kilometre buried natural gas pipeline network, which links its gas fields to
Gladstone and is part of the company's Queensland Curtis LNG project.

The other two LNG ventures under construction in Queensland, Santos's GLNG venture and Origin
Energy 's Australia Pacific LNG venture, will be watching the process closely, as they also consider
spinning off pipelines once the projects are nearer to completion.
Among the bidders, APA is the only publicly listed company.
Its shares have traded strongly in recent months, despite the very real prospect it may raise equity to
fund its bid if successful.
Macquarie Capital , Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank are on hand to manage the equity piece.
