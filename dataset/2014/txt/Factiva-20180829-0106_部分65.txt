Beilby sale
CoreStaff has acquired a majority stake in Perth-based recruitment company Beilby Consulting. The

executive Graham Jenkins said there was a strong commitment from Beilby staff to making the
partnership succeed. CoreStaff started in Darwin in 2008 as a labour-hire company and now lists BHP
Billiton and Glencore among is clients. It boasts revenue of more than $100 million a year. Beilby
Consulting was founded by the late Ron Beilby in Perth in 1975.

Troy’s tax win

Troy Resources has secured a tax break from the Guyanese Government to import capital equipment
needed for its Karouni gold project. The Investment Development Agreement will allow it to import
equipment duty and tax free. Troy picked up the Karouni project when it acquired Azimuth Resources
last year. Paul Bensen-headed Troy released its quarterly report yesterday, which showed record
quarterly silver production from the Casposo mine in Argentina, up 22.3 per cent to 710,178 ounces.
Production at the company’s Andorinhas mine in Brazil was up 5.7 per cent to 8200oz. Troy shares
closed up 1¢ at $1.02.

$100b drug play
US drug giant Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, has targeted British rival AstraZeneca in a $107 billion
takeover, Pfizer revealed yesterday. AstraZeneca rejected an initial approach in January valuing the
company about £59 billion ($108 billion). The cash and shares deal would represent a 30 per cent
premium on AstraZeneca’s closing share price of £35.26 on January 3, which was the date of the offer.
Pfizer remains interested and is confident a combination is possible.

Leighton contract
Construction giant Leighton Holdings has been awarded a $1.16 billion contract to build an immigration
and customs building between Hong Kong and Zhuhai-Macao.
