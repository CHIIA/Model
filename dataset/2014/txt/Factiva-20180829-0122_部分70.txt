The S&P/ASX200 is expected to close mildly lower.
Markets were sharply weaker in Europe and the UK partly on Crimea concerns, partly on the small solar
power company in China being allowed to default, with metals worried on South Africa's having passed
amendments to its Minerals & Mining Act.

US markets closed mixed.

On the NYSE where 3208 issues traded there were 1,331 issues higher, 1,796 down and 81 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2705 issues traded there were 1,277 issues higher , 1,325 down and 103 unchanged.
Metals were sharply lower, crude rose, gold weakened. The $A is at 90.66US c, down 20 points from
Friday evening.
*On Saturday China reported its CPI came in at 2% for Febraury vs 2.1% expected.

*The PPI fell 2%, more than expected, extending to 24 months the longest decline since 1999.
Customs Data on Sunday showed China's exports fell 18.1% in February from a eyar earlier, the biggest
drop since the global financial crisis. Imports rose 10.1%, leaving the trade deficit at the largest in two
years.

Combined January-February data for IP, fixed asset investment and retail sales will be announced on
March 13.

The numbers are seen as likely to be distorted because of the Lunar Year holiday.

"Probably going to give back about 25 on the day"

"Maree" said, "We are probably going to give back about 25 on the day, with volumes thinned by Labor
Day holidays in Victoria and South Australia. The RBA Governor has said rates will probably be stable for
awhile. The numbers we received last week were better than expected, showing that the low interest rates
are filtering through into the economy". Maree added, "If the $A drops, our inflation rate is likely to rise
above 2% because of the amount of goods we import".
Meanwhile, she said, "We are very dependent on our trading partners, China and Japan. Japan is still in
diabolic trouble. The Chinese export numbers were lower than expected - the slow down there may be
bigger than even the Chinese government expects.

"In the US, although the employment number was higher, the economy is not picking up as rapidly as
expected and interest rates are likely to remain low for a considerable length of time".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 16.4 points to 5462.3 on Friday.

alike went for cash instead, media reports commented.

*Standoff in the Ukraine

Russia has said if Crimea wanted to join the 83 Subjects (States) under its rule it would be very welcome.
It had been separated out of Russia in 1954. Ukraine has ruled the referendum for March 16 is illegal.
*Russia has said Ukraine must pay off almost $2 billion owed for natural gas today, or supplies may be
cut. The last time Russia cut oil supplies to Ukraine was in 2009 which caused considerable hardship in
Europe since the pipelines go through the Ukraine.

Meanwhile the paralympic games have opened in great style in Sochi, with Ukrainians and Russians also
competing.

*Alarm bells ring on South Africa's amended minerals law - more below.

March 10. Good morning.

*Barron's cover story for the week of March 10 was on 3-D printing - the technology may hold great
promise but the stocks do not. "why the industry darling could tumble 80%" Barron's says in its headline.

*Baron's was bullish on MetLife.

*Barron's was bullish on Daimler, also on Great Lake shares.

*Barron's International trader - Europe said a deepening rift between Russia and the West could take a
heavy toll on investors.

*Barron's International Trader - Asia was bullish on Sony.

Trading points:

*While a search of the South African government websites has not so far yielded information on the latest
changes on the Mining Law, the Financial Times in London reports that on Friday South Africa approved
amendments to its Mineral Development Act which gives far reaching implications to petroleum and coal
miners in South Africa (more below in Other News).
*The Financial Times commented, "Anglo American currently sells thermal coal for just $17 a tonne in
South Africa against $74 to export markets and iron ore for $62 a tonne against $115 internationally".

*Our note: apart from highly negative implications for Australian companies in South Africa, should the
new laws be enforced at their ultimate levels, China companies with operations there could be affected.

*US gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualised rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013, down
from an initial estimate of 3.2%, the Commerce Department reported.

The revision is down to weaker than expected consumer spending.

Severe winter weather in the US is expected to slow growth further in the current quarter.

The Commerce Department initially predicted consumer spending had expanded by 3.3%, but spending is
now estimated to have grown at a 2.6% annual rate.

Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US economic activity.

Bad winter weather has cut into vehicle sales, among other purchases.
Despite the revised GDP estimate, US growth should be regarded as strong, the financial information firm
Markit said.

"The details of the report suggest that investment is growing at an increased rate and underlying demand
continued to expand at a reassuringly robust rate, given the headwinds during the closing months of
2013," said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson.

For all of 2013, the economy grew at 1.9%.
The US trade deficit widened to $39.1 billion in January from a revised $39 billion in December, the

"Mineweb" in Johannesburg last night carried the following report,

Author: Ayanda Mdluli

Posted: Friday , 07 Mar 2014
" According to Lizel Oberholzer, director and head of oil and gas at pan-African corporate law firm
Bowman Gilfillan, “Some of the most significant changes to the Bill were rushed through this week,
including provisions for state participation in petroleum licences,” she said in a statement.

Oberholzer noted that earlier versions of the Bill entitled the State to a free carried interest of 20% and a
further participation interest of 30% with the total state interest capped at 50%.

“The version that was approved yesterday removed the reference to a 30% participation interest as well
as the limit of 50%, effectively giving the State the right to take over an existing petroleum operation,” she
explained.

While previously the State was obligated to pay “a fair market value” for any participation interest that it
acquired, it now only needs to pay “an agreed price” which would present major problems in the future as
the Bill does not make any provision for a situation where price cannot be agreed upon”.

The Bill also introduces the notion of ‘production sharing agreements’, a system employed in other
countries with mature upstream industries. However, South Africa currently implements a tax royalty
system in the minerals and petroleum sector and it is unclear how this system will be combined with a
production sharing regime,” she said.

James Lorimer, shadow minister for mineral resources at the Democratic Alliance (The country's official
opposition in government) referred to the bill as a 'crony enrichment bill', because of the power to
designate mining licence beneficiaries it will provide the Minister.
Also, the state will be entitled to take over 100% of oil and gas companies, 20% for free and the other
80% at a forced, 'fire sale' price; which will allow the Minister to rule the sector by making regulations
which can easily be changed at short notice, he said (our italics)

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has used its majority muscle to override any opposition to
amendments of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, effectively opening the door for
the nationalisation of the oil and gas sector.
The act will effectively govern South Africa’s entire mineral resources sector, including the nascent oil and
gas sector that aims to explore for and extract shale gas in the Karoo.

On Thursday, Parliament’s mineral resources committee finalised its clause-by-clause deliberations on the
bill in a meeting characterised by sniping between ANC and Democratic Alliance MPs.

The votes on contested clauses were always eight to two in the ANC’s favour.

The most contentious of the clauses was introduced by the ANC on Wednesday evening and concerned
the state’s participation in oil and gas production.

While the DA bitterly opposed the changes, saying they would smother investment in the sector, the ANC
overrode its concerns by claiming that the changes were based on the ideology of those who voted for
them.

The two clauses fall under section 86 of the draft law.

The first clause gives the state, through a designated organ of state, the right to a 20% free carried
interest on all new exploration and production rights of oil and gas.

Page182of270©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The second clause now says that in addition to the free carry interest, the state is "entitled" to a further
participation of up to 80%.
Currently the clause imposes a ceiling on the state for an additional acquisition of 30% of the venture.
The oil and gas sector has opposed strongly the proposed free carry interest and the 30% ceiling. A
number of oil and gas sector company representatives left Thursday’s meeting in a sullen mood and
refused to comment, only indicating they would prepare a statement on the matter.
Webber Wentzel law firm partner Peter Leon said that while the bill had been improved considerably,
especially in terms of the beneficiation issue, he found the oil and gas provisions troubling.

"Those provisions are clearly undesirable and will have a negative effect on the sector," he said.

On Friday, the committee will finalise its report on the bill for the National Assembly and it may be debated
next week, which will be the last parliamentary session ahead of the May 7 national and provincial
elections.
