0335 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian interest rate futures market pricing has dialled down the pessimism
over the past week or so, from pricing a 40% chance of 25 basis point rate cut by September 2015 to
just a 25% chance now, says Annette Beacher, economist at TD Securities. "We see the Reserve Bank
of Australia on hold at 2.5% with scant risk of a cut short of a global shock, but at least the RBA has a
cash rate to cut if necessary," she said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0332 GMT [Dow Jones] The National Australia Bank has revised higher its forecast for Australian gross
domestic product growth in 2014/15 to 2.9% from 2.8% prior. It said a record jump in Australian business
conditions in October points to strong start to the fourth quarter but it also warns that growth is still
constrained by weak terms of trade, a soft labor market and signs of a softening in the building cycle.

0331 GMT [Dow Jones] Asia as a region totally dominates Saudi Arabia's oil export flows with a 71%
market share, or 5.1 million barrels/day out of total crude exports of 7.2 million barrels/day this year,
Societe Generale's head of oil research Michael Wittner says. "Flows to the U.S. and Europe are small
and slowly eroding, and just don't matter that much," he says. He also says that despite the fall in prices
last week, crude and petroleum-product demand is increasing seasonally. Oil refineries in all three key
regions of the U.S., Europe and Asia are coming out of maintenance and starting to ramp up operations
ahead of winter; and heating fuel demand is also beginning to pick up, he says. Nymex WTI crude is
down 14 cents at $77.26/bbl, Brent crude is down 28 cents at $82.06/bbl. (eric.yep@wsj.com)

0310 GMT [Dow Jones] The ringgit could slip to 3.3550 versus the U.S. dollar on an intraday basis, the
daily USD/MYR chart suggests. The bullish technical bias for the dollar was maintained by Monday's
closing above the 3.3200 base of the Bollinger uptrend channel. The gradient of the channel has now
steepened, raising the chart support for USD/MYR to 3.3250. The pair, currently at 3.3400 versus its
Monday close of 3.3295, could mark a new high for 2014 if it surpasses 3.3465. The U.S. dollar is back
up across the board Tuesday after a bout of weakness seen yesterday. Apart from underlying yen
weakness due to Bank of Japan's easing measures, the slide in gold and oil prices is another factor
boosting the greenback. Malaysia releases its September industrial production index at 0401 GMT.

Page163of286©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.0305 GMT [Dow Jones] SJM (0880.HK) may cut its dividend as costs rises and earnings drop, says
Deutsche Bank. The Macau gaming operator reported Monday a drop in earnings for the third quarter,
due to lower margins. "The other four operators all reported margin expansion in the third quarter," says
Deutsche, which downgrades the stock to sell and cuts its target price to HK$13.5. "This highlights SJM's
inability to protect margin when competition intensifies." As labor costs in Macau rise, Deutsche says
SJM's capital expenditure may further increase from its current budget, hampering the company's
cashflow. SJM falls 2.0% to HK$15.04 Tuesday. (jacky.wong@wsj.com; Twitter: @jackycwong)

0303 GMT [Dow Jones] Residential property prices in Australia are up by 9.1% on the year,
representing a slowdown from prior quarters, according to government data. "Today's figures are a
welcome addition to the suite of home price data which show that price growth is easing to a much more
sustainable rate," Shane Garrett, senior economist at the Housing Industry Association, says. "The
annual rate of home price growth nationally is back in single figures for the first time in a year," Garrett
says. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Iron ore prices, now around $75 a metric ton, need to fall into the $60s to start
significant output curtailments outside of China, Citi said. "We find only modest cutbacks are likely if iron
ore remains in the $70s, with sustained prices in the $60s needed to prompt significant cutbacks," it
said. Supply expansion from a handful of major global iron-ore miners is threatening to push out
marginal, high-cost producers from the field. Domestic Chinese iron ore production remains resilient,
though it will also come under pressure, the note said. Chinese steel demand is likely to weaken in the
first quarter next year due to tight credit, slower manufacturing growth and government reform, Citi said.

0256 GMT [Dow Jones] New data released by property analytics group SQM Research shows
Sydney's median asking price for free-standing houses has surpassed the one million dollar mark,
recording a median asking price of 1,005,800 Australian dollars. Louis Christopher, SQM's managing
director, says "right now it would be impossible to purchase a free standing house in Sydney's inner ring
for under a million dollars, and will become increasingly difficult to purchase a free standing house in
Sydney's middle ring for under a million dollars." (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
0253 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are lower on thin volume, tracking overnight
weakness in U.S. Treasurys, says a local trader. "Many market participants are standing on the sidelines
amid a dearth of fresh trading cues," the trader adds. The most-traded five-year bond yield rises to
1.1810% from 1.1690% Monday. The USD/TWD is little changed as importers' buying offset continued
foreign fund inflows, says a local trader. The pair is at 30.537, little changed from the 30.540 level mostly
traded before the local central bank's suspected intervention Monday, which lifted it to 30.606 at the
close of onshore trading session, traders say. Foreign investors' net buying of local stocks hit NT$15.86
billion Monday--registering the second-highest single-day net buying so far this year.

0253 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan is likely to continue to post current account surpluses in coming months,
says Mizuho Research Institute economist Kaori Yamato. "The trade deficit is likely to narrow, and the
weaker yen will continue to help expand the income account surplus, leading to current account
surpluses." Yamato says lower energy prices as well as a rebound in exports---particularly as the U.S.
economy recovers--should help shrink the nation's trade deficits. Offshoring of Japanese production,
which contributed to trade deficits, is also likely to slow, she says. Japan posts a Y963.0 billion current
account surplus in September, up 61.9% on the year. (eleanor.warnock@wsj.com)

0248 GMT [Dow Jones] It remains hard to grasp exactly what the catalyst was for a record jump in
Australian business confidence in October, says Ben Jarman, economist at JP Morgan. Retail sales
have benefited from new product releases in electronics recently, which more than doubled aggregate
monthly retail sales growth, but this won't be durable, he said. It will be important to see whether the
recovery in conditions can be sustained into year-end, he added. "We are skeptical that enough

Australia's cyclical position," Jarman added. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0243 GMT [Dow Jones] The upward trend in Australian business conditions continues to point to
stronger domestic demand growth going forward and is consistent with a gradual improvement in the
non-mining sectors of the economy, says ANZ economist Dylan Eades. In addition, measures of firms'
profitability and spare capacity improved in October, Eades says. "These components have a strong
leading relationship with employment growth and the unemployment rate and are consistent with better
labor market conditions," he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
