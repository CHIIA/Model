Daniel: "I think the market has topped out".. downside risk now more than 15%

Daniel Goulding the author of "The Sextant Report" (thank you Daniel) brought forward his weekly report
by one day because he thinks that the market has topped out.

Daniel said in the report, "Last week I mentioned that I was unsure of the nature of the rally that
commenced two weeks ago. The evidence is building that it may well be a terminal rally on the cusp of
completion. While every duck has not yet lined up for this scenario, there are a plethora of red flags that
suggest investors should take this warning seriously. Deflationary pressures are building and this was on
show yesterday with more new 52 week lows than 52 week highs. While I can't rule out one last rally high
in May or June, the significant deterioration in internal backdrop for stocks leads me to revise the Sextant
Liquidity Risk Indicator to Extreme, where downside risk is now greater than 15%".

Daniel reaffirmed his medium term outlook for a fall to 4300 points late this year early 2015 and a long
term secular bull market to commence sometime this decade, maybe as early as 2016.

Our market - after 7 days of range trading its way slightly higher each day and looking like more of the
same today - it hit a high of 5554.5 then began to fall sharply just before midday, hitting a low of 5469.3
before closing down 49.5 points to 5486.6. Volume was high at $4.8 billion and SPI Futures volume was
huge, possibly both indicators that technical trading dominated, with 5555 a technical trigger for stop loss
selling.
*Meanwhile Bloomberg reported 30 of the 31 provinces and municipalities in China missed their 2014
quarterly growth goals, which had been set below the 2013 targets.

In Hebei, where the government is cutting steel capacity had growth of 4.2% vs a target of 8%. In Shanxi,
hit by slumping coal prices and mine closures, expansion was 5.5% vs a full year target of 9%.

Page123of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."For today, I expect the market will rise about 20 points'

"Maree" said, "It looks today as if we will have a gain on the market.

"There has been a lot of focus on Australia's (lower) growth. We have not made new highs like the rest of
the world, we have factored in a lot of this slowdown. We have factored in China's slowing. A lot of the
negatives from the forthcoming Budget have also been factored in - we expect it will be in deficit, may be
another 5/10 years.

"While the $A is too high for manufacturing exporters and others, the Aussie dollar at current levels keeps
inflation restrained. If the $A was weak the RBA would probably be forced to lift interest rates - and we
know the level of debt for households is alarmingly high. I don't think a weaker $A would get us out of
trouble.

"Meanwhile, we have the 4th largest level of funds under management in the world.

"For today, I expect the market will rise about 20 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed at 5536.1, up 5.1 points last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY

Reuters reports in 2012 emissions rose in Japan, Australia, among majors

Industrialized nations' greenhouse gas emissions fell by 1.3 percent in 2012, led by a U.S. decline to the
lowest in almost two decades with a shift to natural gas from dirtier coal, official statistics show.

Emissions from more than 40 nations were 10 percent below 1990 levels in 2012, according to a Reuters
compilation of national data submitted to the United Nations in recent days that are the main gauge of
efforts to tackle global warming.

Still, with emissions rising elsewhere, experts said the rate of decline was too slow to limit average world
temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, a ceiling set by almost
200 nations to avert droughts, heatwaves and rising seas.

Page124of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Total emissions from industrialized nations fell to 17.3 billion tonnes in 2012 from 17.5 billion in 2011 and
compared with 19.2 billion in 1990, the base year for the U.N.'s climate change convention.
U.S. emissions fell 3.4 percent in 2012 to 6.5 billion tonnes, the lowest since 1994, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency said on April 15. The fall was linked to low natural gas prices, helped by
a shale gas boom and a shift from coal, a mild winter and greater efficiency in transport.
In the European Union, emissions dipped 1.3 percent in 2012 to 4.5 billion tonnes and were 19.2 percent
down from 1990 levels, the European Environment Agency said.

Among other major nations, emissions dipped in Canada in 2012 but rose in Russia, Japan and Australia.

*MSB: Japan progress/Prochymal Phase 3 trial for Crohn's disease to resume

Mesoblast Ltd advised in an update on its clinical programs using the product Prochymal acquired as part
of the entire culture expanded mesenchymal stem cell business of Osiris Therapeutics that the key aspect
for the acquisition was the potential for early and significant revenue streams using Prochymal, the
world's first approved allogeneic stem cell therapeutic and the only allogeneic stem cell therapeutic
designated by the US FDA as both an Orphan and Fast Track product.

Mesoblast will meet with the US FDA shortly to discuss potential pathways for accelerated Prochymal
product approvals for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD. In Japan, Mesoblast collaborator
JCR Pharmaceuticals is expanding its manufacturing facility to prepare for the commercial launch of its
MSC product JR-031. The product was granted orphan drug status in December 2013 and as a result will
be subject to an expedited review.

Mesoblast expects to have a read out of the end of the year on whether the primary endpoint of day 28
remission in Crohn's disease biologic-refractory patients has been achieved and whether there is evidence
of efficacy in high risk groups.

(Osiris had announced positive results from a pilot Phase1/2 in 2006 for Prochymal in treatment of patients
with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

A Phase 3 trial had followed, with a pre-determined futility analysis resulting in temporary cessation of
recruitment. MSB now intends to complete this Phase III trial).

tonnes of steaming coal), 9% higher than the previous quarter due to improved plant performance during
the quarter.

comparable period impacted by a scheduled shut down and wet weather associated with Cyclone Oswald
in early 2013. On the development front, in January 2014 the resources division acquired Mineral
Development Licence 162. MDL 162 is located between and adjacent to the Curragh and Curragh North
mining leases with the acquisition to augment the total base of coal reserves potentially available for
mining and processing at Curragh's coal handling and preparation plants. The additional coal reserves
are expected to extend Curragh's mine life and provide future options to further optimise mine operations.
A feasibility study has commenced with respect to potential future development of MDL162.

18.9% on the previous corresponding quarter due to operations in a more productive section of the

*PRU: Improved performance at Edikan, guidance lowered after fire
Perseus Mining Ltd announced the trend of improved operating performance at Perseus' Edikan Gold
Mine (EGM) in Ghana continued during the quarter as indicated by increases in the run time of the SAG
mill (88%) and gold recovery (86% in March 2014) .

Page132of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.A total of 43,787 ozs of gold were produced, reflecting an expected short term decrease in the head grade
and quantity of ore processed during the quarter.
The EGM's all in site cost (including production, royalties, development and sustaining capital) was
reduced during the quarter but given the expected reduction in gold production, unit costs increased
slightly to $US1,286/oz.
43,873 ozs of gold were sold in the quarter for an average sale price of $US1,294/oz.

A fire in the cyclone cluster of the processing plant during routine maintenance following the end of the
quarter saw processing of ore interrupted for seven days. This has contributed materially to a change of
gold production and subsequently cost guidance for the six months ended June 30 2014.
Perseus also updated the development of Sissingue Gold Project in the Cote d'Ivoire where a two year
extension has been granted while in exploration significant drill intercepts from the Bele Central prospect
were delineated at the Mahale project in Cote d'Ivoire.

December quarter.
Australian operations at Gwalia and King of the Hills was solid, Simberi gold production improved 22% to
10,847 ozs vs 8,908 ozs for the December quarter, lower than expected due to poor mobile fleet reliability
and delayed ramp up of the 3.5Mtpa plant expansion.
Gold Ridge production increased by less than expected to 15,690 ozs vs a rain event but was up from
14,912 ozs in December.
Gold Ridge remains suspended until a site assessment can be completed following torrential rain at the
beginning of April.
SBM has $58 million in cash including $2 million restricted cash plus undrawn credit facilities of $24
million.
Leonora has produced 1 million ozs of gold since SBM recommissioned the Gwalia mine in October

*VXL: Graphite sales commence - first Australian graphite sales in over 20 yrs
Valence Industries announced it has sold its first graphite, the first sales in Australia for over 20 years.
Shipments to Japan are to commence in the coming weeks.

Uley Graphite from reprocessed material will be used for applications ranging from industrial lubricants and
refractories to battery applications.

Valence Industries' Phase 1 Re-commisisoning program continues.

(Our note: The Uley graphite resource is 1.9Mt indicated and 4.5Mt inferred in high grade flake graphite at
a 3.5% graphitic carbon lower cut off grade with metallurgy confirming high process grades. It produced
graphite for export from the 1800's up until 1993.

The mine is located on the southern Eyre Peninsula within 22 km of Port Lincoln with established regional
support infrastructure and multi modal transport facilities.

Eagle Bay Resources had earlier struggled to commence production from Uley Graphite for many years,
later changed hands several times.

July 26 1999: flake graphite upto 95% pure carbon has been produced.

CRA had previously estimated the mineralisation at Uley to be 387m tonnes at

7.4% graphite. While on care and maintenance, additional exploration
indicated a new in situ indicated resource of 1.5 million tonnes at 15.3%

graphite providing a 50% lift in head grade, giving at least a 10 year mine

life.
The company is confident that acceptable marketing arrangements with

Japanese trading houses can be re-established.

In July 1999 research carried out by Eagle Bay together with the South Australian Mines

Department and the CSIRO have produced during laboratory a HiC Graphite

(99.9% carbon) from the low value fines discarded during coarse flake

processing.

Market Cap $60m.
