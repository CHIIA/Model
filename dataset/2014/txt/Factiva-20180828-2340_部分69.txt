DAVID Devine’s Metro Property Group will boost its already bulging pipeline of apartment projects
with the purchase of a Bowen Hills industrial site.
Sources say Metro will pay about $25 million for a 1.56ha site at 66-98 Montpelier Rd.

Executive chairman David Devine said it was a “strategic acquisition” in an area where the company
had two completed and other apartment projects under construction or in planning stages.

“Due to the success that we’ve had in this area this will ensure future supply,” Mr Devine said.
“Apartment sales have been significantly higher in the past three months. “So we’ll get into this one
in 2017.” Metro proposes a mixed use development of up to 550 apartments in four or five eight level
towers plus 1200sq m of retail fronting Montpelier Rd. A Development application will be lodged early
next year and the project will be designed by Woods Bagot.

The deal was negotiated by JLL’s Seb Turnbull and Christian Sandstrom. Metro managing director
Luke Hartman said it was a “smart play”. “It’s a strategic midterm land bank and we have the ability to
get some passing income,” he said.

More than $1 million in rent is being paid by a variety of tenants. Mr Hartman said Metro had 4782
apartment on its books in Brisbane of which 1785 have been sold.

“We’re very bullish on the Brisbane market,” he said.
“We see Brisbane as the place to be in the apartment market compared with Sydney and Melbourne
due to the price gaps that exist at the moment.

“We have over 1000 units under construction, we will sell a 1000 apartments this year and a 1000
next year.” Mr Hartman confirmed the Chinese-based R & F Group have exchanged contracts to
buy Metro’s TAFE site in South Brisbane and its Riverview Towers site at Kangaroo Point for a
rumoured $65 million.

He said Metro was also on the hunt for more sites.
“I’m not speaking out of school, but we’re very near to another major transaction,” he said.“There’s a
lot of confidence out there.”
