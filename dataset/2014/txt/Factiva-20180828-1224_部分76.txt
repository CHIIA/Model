Mumbai: ICICI Bank , the country’s largest private sector
bank, announces the launch of EMI (Equated Monthly
Instalments) facility on debit cards to enable its
customers to convert their high value transactions into
easy instalments. The Bank is the first in the country to
introduce this facility.

Speaking at the launch, Mr. Rajiv Sabharwal , Executive
Director, ICICI Bank said, "ICICI Bank has always been
at the fore-front of providing an enhanced consumer
experience in line with the philosophy of Khayaal Aapka.
As we approach the festive season, we believe this
initiative will empower over 22 millionICICI Bank debit
card customers to buy products of their choice and pay
in easy EMIs."

To begin with, ICICI Bank has tied up with Samsung
India to offer this facility across 9,000 stores in the
country including large format retailers, multi-brand
outlets and stand-alone stores for purchase of
Samsung products like mobile phones, tablets and
consumer electronics, among others. The Bank will add
many more brands under this facility in the months to
come.

Speaking on the association, Mr. Asim Warsi, Vice
President, Mobile & IT, Samsung India said, “We are
delighted to associate with ICICI Bank for their first ever
debit card EMI initiative in India. The tie-up will offer
financial flexibility, drive engagement and create easy
product accessibility for our consumers. With the festival
season around the corner, we are confident that such
exciting schemes will add to consumer celebrations. Our
customer centric approach has always helped us create
products and services that offer more value to our
customers and enrich their lives.”

ICICI Bank debit cardholders having fixed deposits with
the Bank can avail of this facility of buying products and
then paying in EMI of 3, 6, 9 or 12 months. This facility
will offer a three-pronged advantage to customers as
they can leverage on their fixed deposits and earn
interest, while they shop and pay in EMI as well as earn
reward points on transactions. This will also help many
customers, who have only debit cards, to buy and pay in
EMIs—a facility which was so far available only for credit
cardholders.

An ICICI Bank debit card customer can visit any
participating store to avail of this facility.

HDFC Bank opens 400th branch in Maharashtra –
20/8/2014

Launches 2-member rural mini-branch in unbanked
village of Lonkhairi

Nagpur, (Maharashtra) August 20, 2014: HDFC Bank
Ltd today reached an important milestone of 400
branches in Maharashtra. The 400th branch is a

Page298of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.2-member mini-branch located in the unbanked village
of Lonkhairi in the Kamptee Taluka of the Nagpur district
of the state.

The new branch will cater to the local population of just
over 2,000 in and around Lonkhairi. The 350 families in
this largely agricultural economy have hitherto had no
access to formal banking services.

The branch was inaugurated by Mr. Satish Bhoyar,
Sarpanch, Lonkhairi, and Mr. Hemant Pawar, IAS,
Additional. Commissioner, Nagpur Municipal
Corporation, in the presence ofMr.Sarang Dani, Circle
Head, HDFC Bank and other senior officials of the bank.
It is located at HDFC Bank Ltd , Ground Floor, Gram
Panchayat, Loankhairi (Nanda), Taluka -Kamptee,
District – Nagpur, 441111.

HDFC Bank has more than doubled its branch network
in Maharastra in the past five years, on its journey to the
400th branch milestone, This journey began with its very
first branch in the country, which was set up at Sandoz
House in Mumbai in 1995. HDFC Bank is today reaching
out to an increasing number of people across the state.

Speaking about the milestone from Mumbai, Mr. Amit
Kumar, Branch Banking Head, HDFC Bank said: “Our
extensive 400-branch network in Maharashtra reiterates
our commitment to take formal banking services to every
part of the state. Our objective is to empower more
people in Maharashtra by offering our full range of
banking services, even in rural areas, thus making a
difference in their lives. At a national level, HDFC Bank
has 55% of its branches in semi-urban and rural areas
and is continuously extending its reach in the hinterland
in its endeavour to support inclusive growth “

Speaking at the launch, Mr. Sarang Dani, CIrcle Head,
HDFC Bank said, “The journey to reach the 400th
branch milestone in Maharashtra has been extremely
fulfilling, right since the launch of our first branch in
Mumbai. We are expanding into deeper geographies
with increased intensity, and we look forward to bringing
a whole new world of convenience and flexibility to
customers across the state.”

A mini branch is one of the new-format branch models
introduced by the Bank, to take formal banking services
to people in unbanked and underbanked areas. It
enhances the Bank’s efforts towards achieving its
financial inclusion goal. The Bank has a board
mandated objective to bring 10 million families (50
million Indians) into the banking fold.

The mini branch is designed to be cost-effective by
maximizing efficiency of space, infrastructure,
technology and processes. The product range at a mini
branch is comparable to that in a traditional branch and
the two members are available to provide customers an
array of services. The two-person branch works closely
with the nearest large branch, operating as hub and
spoke to cater to a particular geography and ensure that
all products and services are made available to
customers.

Page299of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.As of June 30, 2014, the Bank had a distribution network
with 3,488 branches and 11,426 ATMs in 2,231
cities/towns.

The Bank has made significant headway in its
multichannel servicing strategy in Maharashtra,
providing customers the use of its complete range of
products and services. It offers, under one roof, products
ranging from basic services such as Savings Account,

Fixed Deposits, Current Account, Two-wheeler loan,
Auto loan, Commercial Vehicle Loan, Kisan Gold Card,
Agri and Commodities Loans to direct access banking
channels such as, PhoneBanking, NetBanking and
International Credit and Debit Cards.

Growth of Small Industries Development Bank of India

Shallu Sharma, Dr. Navkiranjit Kaur Dhaliwal

Abstract

Various institutions were set up at All – India and State
level with a view to cater exclusively to the needs of
small business enterprises. Among, them the Small
Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was set
up by the Government of India under the special act of
Parliament in April 1990. It is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI). There
was delinking of SIDBI from IDBI as subsidiary in
accordance with the amendments approved by the
Parliament during the year 2000. SIDBI is now the
principal financial institution for promotion, financing &
development of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
(MSMEs) in the country. In this paper, an effort has
been made to study the growth of Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI).

The growth of the Bank has been evaluated based on
some selected variables namely Branch expansion,
Manpower, Net worth, Deposits, Borrowings,
Investments, loans & advances. The secondary sources
of data have been used to achieve the objective of the
study. The secondary data has been collected from
annual reports of the SIDBI from 2000-2001 to
2011-12.As there was delinking of SIDBI from IDBI
during the year 2000, so it is required to evaluate the
growth of the Bank after this period. The data has been
analyzed by using various statistical tools like average,
exponential growth rate, percentage & co–efficient of
variation.

The study examined that growth of total staff was more
consistent (C.V. = 9.06%) than other parameters under
study. Further, highest growth rate has been observed in
the total deposits (42.60%) as compared to all other
variables. The overall growth performance of the SIDBI
has been satisfactory during the period of study.

The publication provides bank-wise and bank
group-wise information on major items such as liabilities
and assets, income and expenses, non-performing

advances. It also provides bank group-wise monthly
data on some of the major items that include aggregate
deposits, liabilities to the banking system, assets with
the banking system, investments, bank credit, and
sector-wise and industry-wise gross bank credit.

The analysis based on the data presented in the
publication shows that:

marginally during 2012-13. At the bank group level, NIM
of “New Private Sector Banks” increased, remained
unchanged for “Foreign Banks” and declined for rest of
the bank-groups in 2012-13.

Profitability in terms of return on assets (RoA) of all
SCBs at the aggregate level declined marginally during
2012-13. At the bank group level, RoA declined in
respect of “Public Sector Banks” while all other bank
groups witnessed an increase in RoA during 2012-13.

Cost of funds increased for all the bank-groups in
2012-13. At the same time, return on advances declined
for all bank-groups except “Private Sector Banks”.

Return on investments adjusted to cost of funds
declined in 2012-13 in all the bank-groups.

Bank’s Forward Guidance

•Recently released economic data-points – IIP, exports
PMI (composite) indicate an all round improvement amid
moderating inflation.

•So far, the inflation trajectory is consistent with the
RBI’s guidance. However, risks to inflation have grown
on account of poor agricultural show in Jun-Jul, 2014
and uncertainties about global crude prices. There is a
strong possibility that the RBI may defer monetary policy
easing beyond people’s expectations.

• The Bank aspires to grow with cautious optimism and
would concentrate on improving its domestic NIM to
3.0% through further rebalancing of loan-book; bringing
the ROAA close to 1.0% by further improving the CASA
share and improving the yield on advances on the back
of likely industrial recovery.

•On the qualitative side, the Bank’s endeavours at BPR,
Capacity Building, Technology Up-gradation, Talent
Management & Training, Marketing, etc. would continue
with full vigour.

•The Bank is continuously evolving its Strategic Focus to
cope with changing circumstances.

•In the year FY14, it succeeded in giving retail
orientation to its business; further strengthening its
liability franchise and bringing down incremental
slippages & restructuring pains.

•In Q1, FY15, it implemented a Course Correction to
stay in tune with economic reality.

•The Bank will continue embracing transformation to
increase Core Competence and achieve Sustainable
Growth across all business segments by continuously
adapting its business model to suit the economic
environment. Its committed to protecting its Strong
Brand Value in the Indian Banking space.

having completed 50 years of its splendid journey in
nation building. On this occasion, IDBI Bank introduced
mobile banking service for all its customers. This facility,
which is accessible from any mobile device, enables the
customer to meet all banking needs such as fund
transfer, bill payments, visa money transfer, DTH/
Mobile recharge and much more from any destination. It
also launched Signature Debit card for HNI customers
on the occasion. Supporting its commitment to
strengthening presence across the length and breadth of
the country, IDBI Bank also opened 50 new branches
Pan-India.

IDBI Bank entered in to an MoU with FICCI-CMSME, an
affiliated body under the umbrella of FICCI, for financing
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) across
the country at competitive interest rates.

IDBI Bank has launched a robust E-waste (electronic
waste) management policy. It is one of the first PSU
Banks to script such a policy to contain the harmful
effects of e-waste, defined as discarded computers,
printers and accessories, network equipment, IT
accessories and associated/other electrical items. All
branches of IDBI Bank will henceforth dispose such
e-waste through an empanelled vendor, who would
need to be a dismantler/recycler registered with the
State Pollution Control Board.

IDBI Bank launched a comprehensive IT system ‘I-DaB’
for Disaster & Business Continuity Management that
involves protection of human lives and continuity of
critical operations through alternate locations in the
event of disasters/disruptions. The system would
automate various processes for I-DaB viz. risk

disruptions, BCP invocation, testing/ mock drills etc.
