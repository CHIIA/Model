THE sharemarket has fallen, with weakness in most sectors, as investors remain cautious due to
conflict in Iraq and Ukraine.
Uninspiring local jobs data and Chinese consumer confidence figures also contributed to the
weaker performance.

The major banks weighed on the market for a second straight day, but falls were also posted by
miners, gas and oil producers and healthcare companies.

"The focus is still on the conflict that we're seeing in Iraq and the concerns in Ukraine and that's
keeping markets a little edgy and volatile at this point," CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian
said.

Among the banks, Westpac lost 32¢ to $33.83, National Australia Bank shed 28¢ to $32.80,
Commonwealth Bank dropped 56¢ to $81.02 and ANZ was 20¢ weaker at $33.42.

The big miners posted small falls, with Rio Tinto dropping 46¢ to $59.07 and BHP shedding 25¢ to
$36.21, while Fortescue Metals was steady at $4.36.

Goldminer Newcrest dropped 26¢ to $10.55 as the price of the precious metal weakened.

Elsewhere, property developer Lend Lease dropped 50¢, or 3.7 per cent, to $13.12, despite saying
the sale of its interest in an upmarket UK shopping mall will boost its 2014 net profit by 45 per cent.
Treasury Wine Estates was a standout, adding 24¢, or 5 per cent, to $5.07, after outlining major
changes to its operations and structure that will cost $260 million.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 30.8 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 5402.

The broader All Ordinaries index was down 28.3 points, or 0.52 per cent, at 5386.8.

The September share price index futures contract was 35 points lower at 5353, with 29,024
contracts traded.
National turnover was 2.15 billion securities worth $5.86 billion. AAP
