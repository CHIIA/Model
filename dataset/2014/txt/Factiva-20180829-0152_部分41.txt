NOOSA’S Starkey family will hand over the reins of Noosa Springs Golf and Spa Resort on Monday.
The family has been steering the development of the residential resort and master-planned
communities for 20 years.

Noosa Springs Investment Pty Ltd has purchased the golf course, clubhouse including spa and
fitness operations, resort accommodation and the remaining 23 vacant lots of the Oasis residential
enclave.
The company is a related entity of Golden Horse Nine Dragon Lake Holdings Ltd, a major Hong
Kong-based real estate and resort developer.
It has been reported that Golden Horse Nine Dragon Lake Holdings Ltd also acquired a hotel
development site and a majority shareholding of Links Hope Island Golf Club, Gold Coast.

The Starkey family’s StarCo has retained the two development sites to the south of the clubhouse,
which managing director Alan Starkey says are suitable for a major luxury development in the future.
In 1992, StarCo bought the 103-hectare property and developed it into Noosa Springs.

Noosa Springs now has more than 300 dwellings.
