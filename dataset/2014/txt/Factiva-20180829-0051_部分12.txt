Gas-linked US prices could be at parity with price tied to oil

LNG will supply more than half of Asia's gas needs by 2030, providing more market opportunities for
Australian LNG exporters, according to the chief executive of Australian oil and gas producer Santos,
which will start exporting LNG from the country next year.

Speaking at the Brisbane Mining Club Thursday, Santos CEO David Knox also LNG's share of total
Asian gas supply could grow to 52% from the current 35% by 2030, while the region's total energy
demand will surpass the rest of the world combined by 2030.

"Despite slowing growth in Asia, urbanization continues to see the equivalent of 10 cities the size of
Brisbane being created each year," Knox said.
Brisbane, the capital of the eastern Australian state of Queensland, has a population of 2.2 million
people.

Moreover, Asian gas demand is projected to grow at 3% per year over the next 15 years, which is
more than double the rate of the rest of the world combined, he said.
Knox said the gap between supply and demand for LNG will be about 100 million mt/year by 2050,
thanks to Asia's increasing reliance on imported fuel.

Acknowledging that the global LNG market is "very competitive" Knox said Australia needs to adopt
new onshore and offshore liquefaction technologies and cut red tape in order to drive down the cost of
developing projects in the country. Most of the LNG projects under development in Australia have
seen huge budget blowouts in recent years.

Santos is a key investor in three regional LNG projects: Darwin LNG, Papua New Guinea LNG and
Gladstone LNG. The Australian independent is also the operator of GLNG, which is located on Curtis
island, off the Queensland port of Gladstone in eastern Australia.
All have sold volumes based on traditional crude oil linked term contract pricing, increasing Santos'
exposure to oil prices from 30% a few years ago to 40% now and to 70% by 2015, when all three
projects will be operational, Knox said.
Gas vs oil link

Many Asian buyers now want to sign LNG term contracts linked to other indexation points, notably the
US gas benchmark Henry Hub, rather than use traditional crude oil linked pricing. But Knox warned
that such pricing will not necessarily make LNG prices lower for Asian buyers, given high costs.

"If you use a Henry Hub Price of say $6-7/MMBtu in 2020, by the time you add the 15% capacity mark
up, the liquefaction and transportation, and the cream that traders will take on top of that—then you
will see that you have landed US LNG into Japan or Korea at around $14-14.50/MMBtu," Knox said.

circa $14.50/MMBtu."

"US LNG will be important but not a silver bullet," Knox added, noting that Russia will also play a role,
but will only meet around 6% of China's gas demand by 2030 through the two countries' massive new
pipeline gas deal.

But Knox's arguments appears to hold little weight for some Asian buyers. State owned Korea Gas
Corporation —the world's largest single buyer of LNG—is still understood to be mulling a potential sale
of a 10% stake in the Gladstone LNG project, reducing its stake to 5%, despite rising domestic
demand for gas.
In late 2010 Kogas paid $607.8 million for a 15% stake in GLNG, after agreeing to import 3.5 million
mt/year of the plant's output for 20 years beginning 2015.

GLNG 'on track'

GLNG is over 80% complete and remains on track to ship its first cargo in 2015, according to Knox.
Santos operates and holds a 30% stake in GLNG. Its partners in the project are Malaysia's Petronas
(27.5%), French major Total (27.5%) and Kogas (15%).
Knox also said the ExxonMobil -operated PNG LNG project—in which Santos has a 13.5% stake and
which became operational in May, six months ahead of schedule—expects to ship a cargo every four
to six days to term buyers in China, Taiwan and Japan, for the next 30 years.
PNG LNG's long-term contractors include Tokyo Electric Power Co ., Osaka Gas , China's Sinopec
and Taiwan's CPC.

Early cargoes from PNG LNG are being sold largely to term offtakers at spot prices, applying
downward pressure on the LNG spot market, trading sources say.

Santos' new projects are expected to hit the market at the same time as a slew of new developments
in Australia will add over 40 million mt/year to the market by late 2015, likely further depressing LNG
price levels in Asia, they add.
