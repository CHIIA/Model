LONDON--Red Rock Resources PLC (RRR.LN), a miner with gold interests in Colombia, Ivory Coast
and Kenya, said Monday that Jupiter Mines Ltd., a steel feed company in which Red Rock has an
interest, continues to ramp up production ahead of expectations despite a challenging market
environment.
Red Rock has a 1.2% stake in Jupiter and a 0.75% gross revenue royalty interest in its Mt. Ida
iron-ore project.

Red Rock passed on information from Jupiter's annual general meeting in which the recently-listed
miner said its 49%-owned Tshipi Borwa manganese mine in South Africa produced 1.06 million metric
tons of manganese in its first full-year of production. The mine is now on track to product 2 million tons
of manganese this fiscal year, having already produced more than 1 million tons in the first five and a
half months of the year.

Jupiter expects its Tshipi mine to achieve earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebtida, of between $23 million and $49 million at a price of $4.50 a dry metric ton,
free on board. This indicates an expectation that the manganese price will rebound from its recent low
of $3.30 a dry metric ton.
Nearly 80% of Tshipi sales have been into China, where the market share achieved in Chinese
seaborne manganese trade was estimated at 12%. Jupiter's stake in the Tshipi mine was
independently valued at $460 million Australian dollars.

Jupiter also expects the Mt Mason haematite project in Western Australian to start production in June
2017, Red Rock Resources said.
