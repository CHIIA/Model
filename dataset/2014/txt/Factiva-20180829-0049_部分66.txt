2255 GMT [DOW JONES] Credit Suisse has a bold idea to create value for Santos (STO.AU) investors:
the Australian company should sell its stake in the US$19 billion PNG LNG project in Papua New
Guinea. "We would strongly applaud any move to sell PNG LNG, but worry that focus may sit more on
scale than value within Santos," says the broker, which rates the stock at underperform with a A$12.90
price target. It thinks Total (TOT) could be a willing buyer, noting the French company bid with a lower
weighted average cost of capital and synergies to secure an interest in the PRL 15 license area in Papua
New Guinea, which contains two large gas discoveries. "We believe a price of more than A$8/share
could be achieved and unlock value for both," Credit Suisse says. More likely, however, is that Santos
and its partners are able to produce more LNG from existing processing facilities. At PNG LNG,
de-bottlenecking by 1 million tons a year would add A$0.96/share to Santos's NPV, Credit Suisse says.

STO last traded at A$14.72. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

22:56 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian auto sales have been stuck in low gear for some months, and there
seems little prospect that they revved up in May, says Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency
Economics. Consumers have been delaying big-ticket purchases in the wake of the federal government's
tough-love budget, which included a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Weinberg expects
Tuesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to show vehicle sales in May fell 0.6% compared
with April, and down 2.5% from a year earlier. "The trend in auto sales is decaying," he says, noting April
sales were also flat on-month and 1.9% lower than a year earlier. (david.winning@wsj.com;

2255 GMT [Dow Jones]--J.P. Morgan upgrades Transurban (TCL.AU) to Overweight from Neutral and
lifts its target price 23% to A$8.26, as it backs CEO Scott Charlton's aggressive growth strategy. "We
have comprehensively reviewed our forecast cash flows to take into account Transurban 's new projects
and investments," the broker says. "The concession extensions and truck toll multipliers we now factor in
result in a material step change in both the cash flows and valuation of Transurban . TCL last A$7.62.

18:16 EDT - Russia still dominates natural gas production and growth, BP CEO Bob Dudley told an
audience at the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow on Monday. Russian gas production rose 2.4% in
2013, spurred by a near 20% increase in EU demand for the fuel, according to BP data. Europe's
dependence on Russian gas has made a lot of western politicians worried, but Mr. Dudley said Russia
and the EU need each other. "I think that the interdependence of suppliers and consumers is a force for
stability in a very turbulent world," he said. "The fact that Europe depends on Russian gas and Russia
depends on European revenues creates an important link." (lynn.cook@wsj.com)
18:08 EDT - In the past five years, global production of oil rose to 86.81M barrels a day, from 82.96M
barrels, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2014. Remarkably, the US was
responsible for 84% of that increase -- or 3.22M barrels. BP counts natural gas liquids, such as ethane,
in it's tally of oil production. The US increase matches the next four countries with the largest increases --
Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada and Iraq -- combined. The largest decreases were recorded in Iran, Libya,
the United Kingdom and Norway. (russell.gold@wsj.com; @russellgold)

17:48 EDT - Fusion-io 's (FIO) shares closed at $11.36 today, above SanDisk 's (SNDK) $11.25 per
share offer, indicating that some investors are betting a higher price will emerge from another suitor. If

Page155of238©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.that happens, SNDK would still see some benefit. The company disclosed in a filing that FIO would pay
a $42M termination if the deal isn't completed. (don.clark@wsj.com)

17:15 EDT - The Supreme Court may force Argentina to do something it has fought against for more than
a decade: negotiate a settlement with holdout bond creditors. Buenos Aires "will likely want to avoid a
prolonged default which could be politically costly and put the strategy of improving ties with foreign
investors at risk," says Daniel Kerner, head of Eurasia Group's Latin America department, in a client
note. "As a result...a settlement is the most likely outcome." That doesn't mean a deal would be reached
quickly, even with a $288M payment is due June 30th. Lower courts may yet buy Argentina additional
time to figure out a negotiating strategy. (ian.talley@wsj.com; @Ian Talley)
17:09 EDT - International oil prices would be nearly $165/barrel, instead of less than $115/barrel
currently, if not for three unexpected events, economist Phil Verleger said at the International Association
for Energy Economics conference in New York. The new oil supplies from the US shale boom have
brought prices down $40/barrel below where they would be, and the US renewable fuel standard has cut
another $30/barrel from the price. However, commercial stockpiling after the 2011 Arab Spring has
pushed prices $20/barrel above where they would otherwise be, Verleger says, making the net effect of
the three events a $50/barrel discount. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

16:43 EDT - Baird initiates Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals (TTPH) at outperform saying it offers an
attractive, undervalued Phase 3 antibiotic candidates. Baird says its drug eravacycline has shown
potential to treat several other infection types and likes the "compound's versatility, especially in
difficult-to-treat multidrug-resistant bacteria." Over the next 12 months, possible catalysts include data
releases from the "pivotal" Phase 3 eravacycline studies currently scheduled for 1H 2015 and this year
the lead-in portion of the results and an IND submission should provide enough good news to get the
stock trending upward ahead, says Baird. Firm puts a $21 price target on the shares which rose 7.2% to
$12.27 on the day, extending the gain over the last year to 55%. (patrick.sullivan@wsj.com)
16:37 EDT - Williams (WMB) says it'll sell $3B worth of stock to finance its acquisition of an increased
stake in natural-gas services provider Access Midstream Partners (ACMP). It's another case of the
recent M&A cycle begetting stock-offering activity. (Until recently, acquisition financings were the
missing piece of an otherwise active environment for big stock sales.) Last week, Exelon (EXC) sold $2B
in stock and $1.2B in converts to finance its purchase of fellow utilities Pepco Holdings (POM). The
WMB deal would be the largest follow-on stock offering in the US since Facebook 's (FB) $3.9B equity
sale in December. WMB closed up almost 19% at $56.02. (matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.com)

16:12 EDT - Pattern of narrow-range, light-volume trading in US stock markets holds for another day,
with equities grinding out minimal gains. Action today featured three sharp reversals -- one upside
following an opening slide, then another downside reversal followed by another rally that waned in the
afternoon. Investors playing it close to the vest ahead of the FOMC meeting that gets underway
tomorrow. Energy stocks outperform, even though Nymex crude oil prices stabilize, for now. Utilities
were also strong, while financial sector was a weak link. DJIA edges up 5.27 to 16781.01, and Nasdaq
Comp rises 10.45 to 4321.11. S&P 500 ends 1.62 higher at 1937.78. (john.shipman@wsj.com)
16:10 EDT - ArcelorMittal (MT) investors and analysts are closely watching the company's new joint
venture VAMA, an $832M automotive steel plant in Southeastern China built by ArcelorMittal and local
partner Hunan Iron & Steel Co. ArcelorMittal 's first major steelmaking investment in China, it opened
Sunday and will be able to produce 1.5 million tons of automotive steel per year for the Chinese car
industry, which grew 16% to 18 million units produced last year. ArcelorMittal fell 0.7% to $14.92.
