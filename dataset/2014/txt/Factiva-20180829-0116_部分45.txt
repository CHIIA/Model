Page125of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.On February 2 2014 for the half year ended December 31 2013 announced profit from ordinary activities
for the half year was up 14.2% to $34.544 million on total portfolio income up 9.6% to $151.556 million.

An 8c fully franked interim dividend was announced vs 7c for the previous corresponding period (pcp).
Record date is March 14. The board has decided the DRP will not operate in relation to this dividend.

NTA backing per security is 85c vs 63c for the previous corresponding period (pcp).
Cash net profit after tax rose 20% to $39 million with 21% like for like receivables growth for the six
months to December 31.
Managing director and CEO Tarek Robbiati said in the report the strong result was driven by the group's
strategy of business diversification, innovation and disciplined execution.
Certegy volume has been robust, with almost $100 million of solar volumes in first half 2014 despite
significant wind back of government subsidiaries that occurred in December 2012. Receivables of $445
million are up 8% on first half 2013.
FlexiGroup paid $46 million net of cash acquired for the Lombard and Once Credit acquisitions over 13
months and these combined businesses have added 500 new distribution relationships with key players
including Dick Smith and IKEA and are on track to deliver more than $10 million in NPAT in the first full
year.
The successful acquisition of Thinksmart's Australian and New Zealand assets (acquired for $43 million
is also expected to drive NPAT growth in 2015.

The CEO said over the next 18 months FlexiGroup's focus will be on transforming itself to becoming an
integrated full service provider of finance solutions to consumers and businesses, with increased focus on
digital across the business.

Analysts expectations: On January 5 a leading broker in a preview of FlexiGroup's interim result forecast
cash NPAT of $39.5 million, up 21% on the pcp, cash eps of 13c, up 14% on the pcp and DPS up 8c up
4% on the pcp.

The broker expects earnings skewed to the second half, in line with results over the last three years.
The broker said it is positive on the long term prospects for FXL, with an acquisition the likely catalyst to
drive growth beyond full year 2015. "However we see some risk first half 2014 may miss consensus
expectations and are therefore slightly cautious buying ahead of the result".

equipment, tailored print services, cloud computing solutions and traditional technology services

identifying vertical opportunities in market segments where we already have strong knowledge and
exposure".
The acquisition is expected to generate annual cash NPAT contribution of $1.5/2 million as of 2015 and

Broker recommendations:

Flexigroup on its web page says BBY, Bligh Capital, Comsec/CBA, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie, Ord
Minnett, UBS are among hrokers who follow the company.

*On March 28 a leading broker (not one of those listed above) placed an "add" on Flexigroup and retained
a price target of $4.60.
the broker said changes to the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) is a potential risk to
FXL's Solar PV financing volumes, that contribute 20% of group total and is the biggest asset
concentration within the business.
The broker said there are three basic scenarios - no change to solar incentives' a reduction to incentives
or the full removal of incentives.

As a reference point, industry installation volumes declined by 30% post the most recent incentive change
in Decemebe 2012.
"All things being equal, the broker said, "Our eanings sensitivity suggests FXL's solar volumes would
need to decline by 60% to see earnings contraction. Whilst we see this scenario as highly unlikely, the
acquisition of Think Office (expected 2015 $A1.5/2 million contribution) looks timely to help offset any
volume pressure".

The broker added, while it is cautious on investor sentiment leading up to the review outcome (mid year),
ultimately it believes that solar demand will not be decimated in a non aided environment.

"Assuming limited volume impact from the review, the current share price looks attractive" the broker
concludes.
