It's hard to believe that in less than two weeks we have rallied from below 5100 to near our 2014 highs as
reporting season seems to have taken many of the bulls by surprise. Today we pushed higher again with a
combination of good overseas markets responding to better, or worse, economic news and a slew of
better than expected corporate show and tells. Another 27 points today, which given Commonwealth Bank
of Australia (A$74.35, -2.2%) was ex dividend (183c) and accounted for 11 points of loss, showed our
strength. Bulls have returned in force and we now have only 80 odd points to go to get to post 2008 highs.

Rallies in banking stocks with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (A$31.62, +0.9%)
leading the way coupled with big resource gains are propelling us onwards .BHP Billiton Limited (A$38.02,
+0.8%),RIO Tinto Limited (A$69.54, +2.4%),Atlas Iron Limited (A$1.15, +5.0%),Fortescue Metals Group
Ltd (A$5.82, +2.1%) and Newcrest Mining Limited (A$11.45, +3.6%) contributing in a big way. In
healthcare stocks, Csl Limited (A$69.20, +2.2%) sprinted higher despite disappointing numbers from
Ansell Limited (A$18.31, -5.1%) today but Ramsay Health Care Limited (A$43.25, -0.6%) and ResMed Inc.
(A$5.05, -0.8%) slipped. Contractors suffered today as UGL Limited (A$6.23, -12.0%) unveiled its
numbers, knocking others in the sector like Cardno Limited (A$6.47, -1.5%),Leighton Holdings Limited
(A$16.24, -0.6%) and Seven Group Holdings Limited (A$7.98, unch). Gold shares continue to recover
with big increases off small bases. Evolution Mining Limited (A$0.88, +6.0%),Kingsgate Consolidated
Limited (A$1.545, +11.2%),Silver Lake Resources Limited (A$0.75, +6.4%) and St Barbara Limited
(A$0.425, +11.8%) in full flight although Regis Resources Limited (A$3.09, unch) seemed to miss out on
the good stuff. Consumer discretionary had a mixed day with Flight Centre Travel Group Limited (A$48.20,
+3.3%) taking off, Domino's Pizza Enterprises Limited (A$19.99, +2.5%) continuing to have all the
toppings but Wesfarmers Limited (A$43.57, -0.6%) eased as did JB Hi-Fi Limited (A$18.00, -1.5%). Gold
medal winners today included Sirius Resources NL (A$2.62, +9.2%),Whitehaven Coal Limited (A$1.665,
+6.1%),Evolution Mining Limited (A$0.88, +6.0%),Oceanagold Corporation (A$2.59, +4.0%),Beadell
Resources Limited (A$0.845, +1.8%) and Panaust Limited (A$2.09, +6.1%) whilst unable to medal(is that
really a verb now) were Buru Energy Limited (A$1.60, -18.8%),UGL Limited (A$6.23, -12.0%),Ansell
Limited (A$18.31, -5.1%),Pacific Brands Limited (A$0.72, -3.4%),Greencross Limited (A$7.57, -2.6%) and
Bradken Limited (A$4.37, -3.1%). Volume was solid for a Monday at around $4bn. Asian markets did their
bit too despite Japanese growth figures coming in a little on the light side at 1% which given forecasts
were around 2.8% were somewhat worrying. All that money being printed for a 1% rise! However in this
current bullish environment no one seems to be that concerned. The upcoming sales tax increase may
have something to do with it? Rogue number perhaps? Anyway the Nikkei shrugged it off posting a 0.4%
gain with Hong Kong up 0.8% and China up a little under 0.2%. In the world of currencies, the Aussie
continues to look strong at 90.6c as did Gold at $1328 and the Digital Tulips continue to wilt! Trading now
around $317 Stocks and Stories 18 of the top 200 stocks hit 52 week highs today including G8 Education
Limited (A$3.82, +3.2%),AWE Limited (A$1.48, +3.9%),David Jones Limited (A$3.16, +1.9%),Platinum
Asset Management Limited (A$7.19, +1.4%) ,REA Group Ltd (A$47.29, -0.7%) and Amcor Limited
(A$10.78, +0.6%). Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited (A$11.78, +0.5%) also reported today and we liked
it. $180m after tax and a 31c fully franked dividend. Seems the Victorian economy isn't that bad after all!
Great news too for Cudeco Limited (A$1.755, +5.7%), with wide zones of massive chalcopyrite's just 10m
from the surface in the Las Minerale SE Extension. Think Wayne told us so! Buru Energy Limited (A$1.60,
-18.8%) Not such a great day today with the latest update from drilling at Ungani 3.Lack of porosity looks
to have been the killer phrase. House rock star G8 Education Limited (A$3.82, +3.2%) G8 Education has
reported a 62 per cent boost in first-half profits to $31.07 million, from $19.2 million in the previous
December half, and announced plans to raise $50 million in the debt markets. The kick inside!

restructuring. Not been a good time for this newbie. Cooper Energy Limited (A$0.515, -1.0%) has posted
a record first-half net profit of $13.6 million, almost triple the level of a year ago, thanks to higher
production from the Cooper Basin and Indonesia, and a lift in oil prices. Good news for the Sun King today
as Rupert looks set to get a tax refund of close to $900m from the tax office. Uncle Joe won't be happy
with this given their close relationship. Looks like he backed the right horse after all. Rupert usually does!
Good tick of approval from the IMF today as well for our banking sector as they announced that the Aussie
banks are one of the safest in the World. Good to know.G20 finance minsters meeting here in the next
week too. UGL Limited (A$6.23, -12.0%) Engineering contractor UGL delivered a 12 per cent rise in
first-half net profit to $31.3 million and confirmed a potential sale of property group DTZ is on the agenda
as it outlined further cost cuts to strengthen its weak engineering division. Ansell Limited (A$18.31, -5.1%)
No bounce here after their results report a 14.9 per cent rise in interim net profit to $US$65.6 million
($72.4 million).The condom maker's revenue rose 9 per cent to $US703.6 million in the six months
ended December 31. Earnings before interest and tax increased 20 per cent to $US82.7 million. Aurizon
Holdings Limited (A$5.19, +1.8%) Despite a slump in profits, they repeated their coal haulage forecasts
which did the trick, recording a 39 per cent drop in net profit after slashing jobs and shrinking its
locomotive fleet. Net profit for the six months ended December 31 fell to $107 million from $176 million in
the year-earlier period. Expect your power bill to rise dramatically if AGL Energy Limited (A$15.95, +0.2%)
has its way. Nothing to do with the Carbon Tax just the gas price is rocketing as the good stuff is set for
overseas markets. As a result AGL have applied for a 20% increase from the regulator. Tomorrow's News
Today US closed tonight for Washington's Birthday. Chinese lending has hit a four-year high. No sign of
slowing credit there. Domestic lending reached Rmb1.3 trillion (&pound;129bn) in January, a near tripling
month-on-month and the highest monthly total since 2010. BHP Billiton Limited (A$38.02, +0.8%) numbers
to come tomorrow. Now the RBA knows a thing or two about the property market one would hope and
they have listed a house for sale that no one knew they had. Apparently it was used as a staff training
college! In Kirribilli no less. Lucky staff. Expecting to get a big price as median price in that suburb is
$2.35m. Scotland, which faces an independence vote this September, has been warned that it is not a fait
accompli in joining the hallowed EU. That's lucky then. As Groucho once said he would never join a club
that would admit him as a member. So if they break away from UK,no pounds, now no euros, maybe they
could try the old Pund Scottis! Meanwhile in South Africa , eleven men who were trapped underground
were rescued. Eleven men? Sounds like the test team was trying to hide from Mitchell Johnson! And
finally spare a thought for Wayne Rooney who is set to sign a new contract of &pound;300,000 a week!
But is he happy? And Readers Digest sold by Private Equity for a Pound! The buyer was a man who
created Bob the Builder! Can he fix it ? Yes he can! That is all
