STOCKLAND, Australia’s biggest diversified property trust, bought a 19.9 per cent stake in
Australand Property Group as South-east Asia’s largest developer, CapitaLand, sold the last of its
holdings.

CapitaLand placed out 226.2 million stapled securities of Australand for A$848.8 million (S$970
million) in total, or an average price of A$3.75 each. This was a 3.6 per cent discount to the closing
price of Australand’s stapled securities on Tuesday.

The Singapore developer expects to recognise a net gain of about $35.7 million after the
transaction is completed.

“We have decided to divest our remaining stake in Australand now as market conditions are
favourable,” said Mr Lim Ming Yan, CapitaLand’s president and group chief executive officer.

“This divestment would allow us to reallocate capital to our core businesses in Singapore and
China.”

Stockland plans to explore “strategic opportunities with Australand” after purchasing 115.2 million
shares in the company, according to a regulatory statement.
The A$435.5 million purchase is the latest in a number of transactions among Australia’s
property trusts.
CapitaLand in November sold a third of its 59 per cent stake or 115.7 million shares at A$3.685
each through Citigroup.
In May, GPT Group, a Sydney-based diversified property trust, dropped an offer to buy
Australand’s commercial and development units after failing to agree on a price.

“CapitaLand is trying to improve its return on equities (ROE) and the business in Australia had lower
ROEs,” said Singapore-based Vikrant Pandey, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian. “CapitaLand feels
there are better opportunities in China to deploy those funds.”
Overseas investor interest in Australian property could weaken this year after the country attracted
a significant volume of foreign investment over the past few years, CBRE Group said in its 2014
investor intentions survey.
