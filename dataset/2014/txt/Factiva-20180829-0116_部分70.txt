The S&P/ASX 200 as at 2:51pm up 18.9 to 5369

Qube is a "neutral"/a "hold" ..

A leading broker retained a "neutral" on Qube with a price target of $2.10 after Qube announced a $200
million equity raising to fund $90 million of growth commitments announced yesterday and further
increase funding capacity for future opportunities.

The broker said it views Qube's diversion into export grain logistics and sees it as an initial investment in
a very inefficient grain export chain.

The broker adds new container terminal at Webb Dock in Melbourne would likely require around 350
million in 2015 and 2016, with the broker expecting a decision by the Victorian government in the next
month. Cost and timing are far less certain for any involvement in the Moorebank intermodal terminal in
Sydney.

*Another leading broker retained a "hold" on Qube with a $2.04 price target vs $2.06 earlier. The broker
said QUB remains difficult to justify on a fundamental earnings basis given the multiple at which it is
trading (23x full year 2015 forecast earnings).

The broker added, "We would still like to see a lower entry pint for the stock, which could eventuate if
QUB misses out on Melbourne's third container terminal and/or the shortlist for the Moorebank
development".

QUB down 5c to $2.18.

GrainCorp is a lighten/competition moves in inc Quattro Grain j/v with Qube ..

A leading broker cut its recommendation on GrainCorp to "lighten" with a price target of $7.85, down from
$8.50 for several reasons, the broker said including its recent outperformance that has led to reduced
valuation support, additional competitive capacity entering the market with Qube's announcement of a
new bulk grain port in GrainCorp's last remaining major regional monopoly and also, the broker believes
consensus earnings forecasts for 2015 are optimistic.

The broker has cut its normalised eps forecasts for 2014 for GNC by 0.4%, raised them by 3.2% for full
year 2015 and cut them by 8.1% for 2016. Its valuation is $7.12.

GNC up 4c to $8.44.

Santos remains a "hold" .. doubts on CSG resource ..
A leading broker retained a "hold" on Santos after the company announced the Meridian gas contract
that could eventually provide 65 terajoules per day or 5% of GLNG capacity, although in practice it may
prove less.

The broker added, the fact that GLNG has contracted any third party gas beyond the ramp up period
implies either (a) it expects its internal fields to be short of gas to fill the full 7.8mtpa for 20 years or (b)
the third party fields can supply at a more economic rate than some of GLNG's more marginal CSG fields
such as Scotia/Arcadia.

The broker added, "The Meridian deal underlines our view that internal GLNG reserves are yet further
away from filling its capacity. GLNG external gas contracts and internal 2P reserves currently cover just
66/75% of the 10,000 PJ we estimate is required to be available to meet its LNG contracts (including
1,599/2,000 PHJ produced in CSG ramp down).

STO up 6c to $13.36

Horizon remains one of the cheapest stocks in the sector but mired in debt ..
Peter Strachan in "StockAnalysis' dated March 26 looks at the whole of the oil and gas sector with
comments on several stocks.

Of Horizon, he said "Horizon remains one of the cheapest stocks in the sector, but mired in heavy debt
ahead of achieving approvals for the Stanley condensate project, which will trigger payment from Osaka
Gas for its involvement in its PNG gas projects. "Political risk remains in China and especially PNG for
Horizon" Peter adds.

HZN down .3c to 30.7c.
