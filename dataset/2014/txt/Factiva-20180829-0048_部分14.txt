0040 GMT [Dow Jones] The post-FOMC Fed speak will start this week, with Philadelphia Fed President
Charles Plosser presenting his views on the economic outlook and monetary policy. A voting member
this year, Plosser has been one of the most hawkish members of the FOMC, and BNP Paribas expects
him to extend that rhetoric. Earlier this year, Plosser said he expected short-term U.S. rates to hit 3% at
end-2015. Plosser is likely expecting rates to be above 4% by end-2016, it says. Plosser will highlight
the Fed's progress on both sides of its mandate, employment and inflation, and reiterate his hawkish
views on rates. Plosser speaks at the Economic Club of New York at 0805 ET Tuesday.

[Dow Jones] Hyundai Motor Co.'s (005380.SE) second-quarter earnings likely will meet market
expectations when it unveils figures next month, says Meritz Securities analyst Kim Joon-seong. He
expects Hyundai's 2Q sales to rise 1.3% on year to 23.5 trillion won ($23.1 billion) but operating profit to
fall 7.3% to 2.23 trillion won, hurt by the local currency's appreciation. The analyst rates the stock as buy
and maintains a six-month target price of KRW330,000. Hyundai is up 0.5% at KRW220,500.

2313 GMT (Dow Jones) The Australian dollar has held its strong gains posted Monday on the back of
the greather-than-50-point print on Chinese performance of manufacturing index, says Greg Moore,
currency strategist at RBC Dominion Securities. Mr. Moore adds that, technically speaking, the overnight
close made a bullish outside-range day that suggests more gains are likely in store. The Australian dollar
has risen by around 8% against the U.S. dollar so far in 2014, and in early Asia trading it remains just
shy of its year-to-date high of US$0.9463, trading at US$0.9425. A break-up would see the currency rise
to seventh-month high. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

play and they've got it priced too high." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com)
2236 GMT [Dow Jones]--Credit Suisse slashes Atlas Iron (AGO.AU) to Underperform from Outperform
and drops its target price to A$0.60 from A$0.90 after cutting its valuation on recent iron-ore price fall
and related expansion of discounts for lower-quality ore. Its revised iron-ore price forecasts are 7%-9%
lower than previous forecasts, with a US$85/ton trough expected from 2H15, and it has raised its quality
discount to 12% from 11%, imposing a US$15/ton price discount for Atlas Blend ore. "Any iron-ore price
dips below $85/ton could see Atlas making negative cash margins," the broker warns. Atlas's 24 July
report is awaited, with focus centering on iron-ore prices and costs in focus. (david.rogers@wsj.com)

18:13 EDT - EUR/USD is likely to be dollar-driven in the next 24 hours with a spate of US data due out
later in the global day, says ASB Bank head of institutional sales Tim Kelleher. US new homes sales,

the situation in Iraq continues to pose a risk and if things escalate, that could be USD-positive. The pair

17:40 EDT - AUD/USD is slightly lower after moves driven by an upbeat China PMI failed to extend
overnight after euro-zone PMI disappointed, says Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer. He adds,
however, longer term China PMI gave the pair "fresh legs and flipped short-term momentum to the
upside." The pair is at 0.9420 from 0.9434 in Sydney Monday. Speizer says he expects the pair to target
0.9445 during the next few days. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)
17:27 EDT - NZD/USD probed higher overnight following stronger manufacturing PMI in China out
Monday but fails to hold up "as weaker European PMIs and stronger US home sales led to a stronger
USD across the board," says ANZ. Firm adds this led to the NZD/USD drifting back to the middle of the
recent range and with no local data due today, the pair will be driven by further USD moves. NZD/USD
last at 0.8715 from 0.8734 late Monday in New Zealand. ANZ says it expects the pair to trade in a
short-term range 0.8660 to 0.8750, (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

17:02 EDT - Canada's overnight index swap market provides a look at how Friday's strong inflation and
retail sales data have influenced rate expectations. Pricing in the OIS market indicates chances of a 25
bps rate hike in March 2015 has more than doubled to 20% from just 9% before the data, says Mark
Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets. To be sure,
that's still far off fully pricing in a rate hike. Chandler is predicting that the Bank of Canada will hike rates
in 2Q 2015. "Markets still haven't fully incorporated what we believe," he says.

volatility and volume could be the norm for this summer season. About $147B worth of Treasury bonds
changed hands as of 2pm ET, says Adrian Miller, a fixed-income strategist at GMP Securities. It marks
the lowest daily volume in a month and just 63% of the 10-day moving average. Traders say thin volume
may exaggerate price swings--meaning price changes might be bigger than economic data would have
normally spurred. Prices drifting lower in late-afternoon trading, with 10-year notes up just 2/32 to yield
2.617%. (min.zeng@wsj.com)
