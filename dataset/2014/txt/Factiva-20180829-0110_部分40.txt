The Great Australian Bight is a promising area for exploration, and India's Bay of Bengal could hold
Asia-Pacific's next huge gas find, according to a leading upstream consultant.
"If you're a big company and you're interested in high impact exploration, then the Australian Bight
Ceduna basin is a very lightly drilled, potentially very large new play, but of course risky, [it] might be
gas, [it] might be oil," said the vice president for exploration research at UK-based analysts Wood
Mackenzie, Andrew Latham.

"You've got companies like Murphy, BP, Anadarko -- [and] Statoil has just joined in -- who've been there
a while now, so first division explorers are really quite intrigued," he said of the Bight. Statoil has a 30%
stake in a $1.4 billion drilling program led by BP in the Ceduna Basin -- part of the the Australian Bight,
a huge stretch of ocean off the central-southern Australian coast.

One frontier exploration block in the far west of the Bight was offered in Australia's 2014 offshore
licensing round, which was announced last week. Turning to the Asia-Pacific region overall, and with the
caveat that his forecast was "wildly speculative," Latham said the huge river-borne sedimentary deposits
in India's Bay of Bengal pointed to the possibility of undiscovered gas fields.

"If you had to pick somewhere where another vast new gas play could emerge, that is one of the places
that's big enough," he said. "There's a huge pile of rock there.... It's one to watch."

Latham was speaking in an interview with Platts held on the sidelines of last week's Australian Petroleum
Production and Exploration Association's annual conference in Perth, Western Australia.

Less upbeat on Australian unconventionals

While acknowledging that Australia's onshore Cooper Basin -- currently a hotbed of unconventional
exploration -- holds promise, Latham urged caution. "The Cooper is one of those plays that is
everywhere on the spectrum: there's existing conventional [gas] production, still a bit of exploration
around that, then there's tight plays that are being tested, [that can] potentially use the same
infrastructure, which is very helpful."

But the prospects for onshore shale exploration in Australia do not look as good as they do in Argentina's
Neuquen Basin, Latham said. "All things being equal above ground, the subsurface in Argentina looks
more interesting [than Australia]. Our forecast is 200 wells [will be drilled] in Neuquen [this year], which is
rather more than you'll see in the Cooper." WoodMac has predicted 25 shale wells will be drilled in
Australia this year.

"It's not enough wells to really prove a new play," Latham said. By comparison, the Edinburgh-based
consultancy has predicted 400 shale wells will be drilled outside North America this year, including 60 in
China, 20 in Russia and 20 in Saudi Arabia. "Compared with Argentina, compared with North America,
the rate of [Australian shale] exploration ... is pretty slow. It's better here than most of Europe, but it's
quite slow really," Latham said. In addition, Latham, noted, shale gas does not fit all explorers' ideal
portfolio because costs are high and returns are low compared to oil plays.

oil-indexed gas is your next best option," he said. In his APPEA conference presentation, Latham
pointed to the unusually high number of recent Australian oil and gas finds which languish at
"contingent" status, or uneconomical at current prices.

About 60-95% of Australian discoveries were classified as contingent over 2009-12, compared with less
than 30% over 2003-08, he said. Discovery costs in Australia rocketed in the same period, from about
$1/barrel of oil equivalent in 2009 to about $7/boe in 2012.
Globally, about 20% of new oil and gas finds are deemed contingent. "The issue in Australia has been
that discoveries in the last three or four years have been quite small," said Latham, explaining that --
unless they were close to bigger fields -- developing such finds was uneconomical.
