0420 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a 14th
month in a row Tuesday saying a sharp fall in the Australian dollar over recent weeks will help the
economy, but that it still remains overvalued. "The most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability
in interest rates," the Reserve Bank of Australia says. The policy rate was kept at its record low of 2.5%
to cushion the economy against the end of a mining investment boom, a sharp downturn in commodity
prices, and growing signs of a slowdown in China. "The exchange rate...remains high by historical
standards, particularly given the further declines in key commodity prices in recent months," the central
bank said following a policy meeting earlier today. The Australian dollar was little moved on the
comments, trading in a tight range around US$0.8750 after. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter:

0354 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian shares, and to a lesser extent their global counterparts, may be part
way through a deeper correction, but will likely stop short of bear market territory, says Shane Oliver,
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors. Among worries bringing the market down are
expectations of tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve; fragile economic growth in Europe, Japan and
China; and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Importantly, however, share-price valuations don't
look extreme. "From a fundamental point of view the cycle still looks okay with no sign of the
overvaluation, overheating economic conditions, onerous monetary tightening or investor euphoria that
normally precedes major bear markets," Oliver says. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

0330 GMT [Dow Jones] The short end of New Zealand government bond yields are likely to continue to
inch higher as the "market still underestimates the path ahead for the official cash rate. We see the OCR
at 4.75% by 2016, while the market prices around a 4.25% OCR in two years' time." says BNZ in a note.
It adds that, with the passage of time, the two-year swap will roll up as it discounts a higher two-year
window for the cash rate. BNZ also sees long-end yields moving higher partly due to moves in the U.S.
equivalent market. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

0318 GMT [Dow Jones] "Occupy Central" does not pose any imminent harm to Hong Kong landlords,
but it will bring more uncertainties in the medium term, says Deutsche Bank. Turnover rent, the practice
of linking rents to the sales generated by the tenants, only accounts for a small percentage of total rental
revenue, so the decline in retail sales have little impact up to this point, it says. In the medium term,
however, mainland visitors may see Hong Kong as a less attractive destination. Among the listed
landlords, Deutsche thinks Hysan (0014.HK) is most impacted, with 100% of its retail portfolio and 43% of
its net asset value affected by the protests. (jacky.wong@wsj.com; Twitter: @jackycwong)

0303 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei rises modestly into positive territory just before the midday break,
now up 0.04% at 15897.31. Volume is tepid at just 990 million shares. The Bank of Japan's decision on
policy is likely to be announced some time in the next two hours. "Traders are being realistic about the
almost zero chance of any policy change; rather, they want to see if there is any dissent among board
members over the BOJ's stance," says an equity trading director at a European brokerage. "Considering
how closely intertwined politics, monetary policy and public investment policy have come to be under
Abenomics, how the BOJ views progress toward its inflation goal could have a dramatic effect on how the
massive Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) rejiggers its portfolio." The director adds that the
market may have to wait until November 17 for second-quarter economic data to get a firmer idea on the
scope of the country's next tax hike, and to grasp the impact of potentially trillions of yen in changes to
domestic stock and bond allocations involved in the GPIF realignment. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank Indonesia said it sold dollars in the market last month to stabilize the
rupiah's exchange rate, citing the move as one of the reasons for the drop in the foreign exchange
reserves to $111.2 billion at the end of September from $111.16 billion at the end of August. Dealers
suspects Bank Indonesia intervened mostly in the third and fourth weeks of September when the
USD/IDR climbed above 12,200. "We hadn't seen any sign of Bank Indonesia's intervention since Friday,
indicating that it doesn't try to drive the pair to certain level, but only to reduce the fluctuation," a dealer
says. They add the central bank will likely continue its policy not to defend the pair at any certain level but
let the market find an equilibrium for the pair. A weaker rupiah is also needed to help Indonesian exports
more competitive while also discourage imports.(i-made.sentana@wsj.com)

0258 GMT [Dow Jones] Gold prices are a touch lower in Asian trade, largely maintaining an overnight
rebound after the price touched a low for the year the previous session. Asian demand for the precious
metal has been relatively modest, but demand could surge if prices were to fall again below $1,200/oz,
ANZ says in a report. India, the world's second-largest gold consumer, will be celebrating its biggest
buying occasion, the Hindu festival of lights or Diwali, on Oct. 23, which could mean an increase in
demand. At 0250 GMT, spot gold was down 0.3% at $1,203.08 an ounce. (biman.mukherji@wsj.com)

0237 GMT [Dow Jones] A softer reading for Australian house price growth in September may have eased
some of the concerns the central bank has about the housing market, however the trend in dwelling
values remains strong with the RP Data CoreLogic index reporting a 2.9% increase in capital city house
price growth over the third quarter, says Tim Lawless, head of research at RP Data. If investor interest in
these markets doesn't moderate the central bank, in conjunction with the banking regulator, can be
expected to intervene via prudential regulation of the banking sector to attempt to slow down the level of
investment lending activity in the market, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0230 GMT [Dow Jones] Despite the sharp fall in the Australian dollar over the last month, UBS currency
strategist Greg Gibbs still expects the central bank to say it is fundamentally high, highlighting the deeper
fall in commodity prices this year. Gibbs adds that over the last month, the RBA has expressed concern
that house prices may have become too elevated and the housing market un-balanced with an
historically high share of loan growth generated by investors. Gibbs doubts the RBA will introduce this
into their monetary policy statement, but if they did it would probably flatten the rates curve and weaken
the Australian dollar on fear that macro-prudential controls were imminent and the housing market may
weaken.(james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0219 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZ government's track to surplus in the current financial year is looking
increasingly difficult after data released Tuesday showed it recorded a larger-than-expected deficit in the
2014 financial year as tax revenue came in below expectations. The FY14 core deficit--operating profit
before gains and losses or Obegal--shrank to NZ$2.9 billion but was wider than the August forecast of
NZ$2.6 billion. New Zealand Finance Minister Bill English says the government won't be sure it can

December update. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)
0215 GMT [Dow Jones] BMD CPO may extend Friday's gain due to a jump in the oil complexes
overnight and as the ringgit falls, says Affin Hwang in a note to clients; the house pegs psychological
resistance at MYR2,220/ton. Benchmark December BMD CPO ended 1.1% higher at MYR2,170/ton
Friday. The BMD was closed Monday for a public holiday. CBOT soyoil is flat at 33.48 cents/lb in
electronic trade after closing 3.2% higher overnight. (huileng.tan@wsj.com; Twitter: @huileng_tan)

0216 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares are down 0.9% at 9016.31, weighed by continued selling from
foreign investors, says a local trader. The government-backed funds seem to be trying to keep the Taiex
from falling below the key 9000 support level, the trader says. "But foreign investors keep placing heavy
short positions in stock index futures, that is hurting investor sentiment," he adds. Many local investors
are confused about foreign investors' increasing bearish stance even though Taiwan's fundamentals
remain sound. Tech stocks are weak; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW) drops 1.2%
to NT$124.50, Hon Hai Precision (2317.TW) is down 0.6% at NT$97.90 and Largan Precision (3008.TW)
falls 0.8% to NT$2,350.00. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)
