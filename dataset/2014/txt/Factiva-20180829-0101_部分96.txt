*ANZ reported a rise of 2.2% in April, with ANZ highlighting that “job advertising has recovered this year,
having risen for four consecutive months at an annualised rate of nearly 30% over this period.”

While the 4 month rate of growth is spectacular, the key point ANZ highlights is the really solid recovery in
the annual rate of growth in Job Ads of 1.5% is now back in positive territory for the first time since August
2011.

They added: “Continuing increases in job ads historically have been a reliable indicator that the next move
in interest rates is up.”

ANZ Chief Economist for Australia Ivan Colhoun said:

Labour demand has strengthened this year…the pick-up in hiring intentions suggests employment growth
will continue to improve modestly in the near term and the unemployment rate should be close to a peak
around 6% or slightly lower.

However Colhoun also highlighted the risks posed to the economic outlook from the “larger-than-expected
fiscal contraction”, a reference to the upcoming federal budget, which is expected to include some harsh
measures.

*ANZ/CBA/NAB/WBC: APRA ruling on debt issuances to impact

Australia & New Zealand Bank advised it currently has two debt issuances held by ANZ Wealth Australia
Ltd of $400 million each, maturing in June 2015 and March 2016 respectively.

Should the change come into effect as currently proposed, it would reduce ANZ's Level 2 capital ratios by
20 basis points, subject to any transitional arrangements agreed with APRA. Consistent with previous
prudential changes, ANZ expects to meet any additional capital requirements through organic capital
generation.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia advised if the APRA ruling comes into effect, it would apply to
approximately $2.2 billion of debt funding within the Colonial Group with maturities through to 2017.
There will be no immediate effect on the Group's capital ratios and the impact on future periods should be
minimal given the Group's strong capital generation capabilities which should enable the orderly transition
of existing non recourse debt to equity funding.

National Australia Bank Ltd announced it has received notification from APRA regarding the definition of
entities to be included within the composition of a Level 2 Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Group
(ADI).

Page218of231©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.This will require subsidiaries, principally National Wealth Management Holdings Ltd) to be included in the
Level 2 ADI Group.

The change is expected to remover over time the capital benefit that NAB gains from the debt on the
NWMH balance sheet. As of March 31 2014 NWMH has $1.97 billion of debt outstanding, through the
issuance of Notes and bank facilities, which is equivalent to 53 basis points of Common Equity Tier 1
capital.

APRA has approved a transition period which will allow the capital benefit of the majority of the
outstanding debt to be progressively reduced through to December 2017. The group is in a strong capital
position and well placed to mitigate the transitional impact on capital through organic means.

Market Cap $93b. / $128b. / $80.5b. / $107b

ANZ down 37 cents to $33.97 / CBA down 20 cents to $78.94

billion. Cash profit was up 8% to $3.772 billion. On net income up 4% to $6.677 billion, with a 7% rise in
average interest earnings assets and an 8 bps decrease in margins to 2.11%. The decline in margins
principally reflects more intense competition in particular in the Institutional and New Zealand businesses.

May 14, record date is May 16. A 6NZ c imputation credit will be paid to New Zealand shareholders. The

Non interest income rose 9% to $3.182 billion, driven largely by the wealth business.
Impairment charges were $97 million lower.
Group CEO Gail Kelly said in the report the result was driven by a strong operating performance from
each division, supported by a further improvement in asset quality.
Over the past six months Westpac has provided more than $41 billion in new lending to Australian retail
and business customers.

Outlook

Ms Kelly said the world economy had generally improved in recent times with Europe pulling out of
recession and the US slowly moving towards trend growth. Partly offsetting that was a deceleration in
growth in China, although expected to settle comfortably above 7%.

In Australia while households remain cautious, the pace of spending growth has lifted somewhat and
confidence has trended higher.

She said she was positive about the second half for Westpac.

Analysts expectations: $3.751.3 bln, div 90c/div 92c/$3.626 bln, div 86c.

Analysts forecasts: The Financial Times reports as of May 02, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 32
polled investment analysts covering Westpac Banking Corp advises investors to hold their position in the
company. This has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts deteriorated
on Aug 30, 2010.
Latest recommendation: Buy 4, outperform 4, hold 12, underperform 5, sell 2.

*On April 24 a leading broker said, "Westpac should see a pick up in revenue given improved lending,
flattish NIM and wealth. BDD may be very low... the Westpac (and CBA) dividend rotation trade is likely to
re-occur.

The broker added the sector is expected to deliver 4.1% eps growth. revenue is likely to be the highlight
for all the banks, up 3.5%, and the best since the GFC. Credit growth has picked up, especially in
housing, while funding benefits have eased margin pressure. Wealth income is also expected to be slid.
This should enable the banks to report positive "jaws' with cost to income ratios down 0.5% to 43%.
