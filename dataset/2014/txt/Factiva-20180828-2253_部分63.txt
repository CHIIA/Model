0518 GMT [Dow Jones] One of Australia's most respected commentators on budgetary matters, Chris
Richardson, an economist at Deloitte Access Economics, says it is now unknown when the federal
budget will return to a surplus, given falling commodity prices and the inability of the conservative
coalition government to get its agenda of spending cuts and other measures through a hostile Senate.
Mr. Richardson says the tax revenues enjoyed during the decadelong mining boom have gone, and the
road to surplus "is completely unknown." "The world is not doing the budget any favors, the Senate is not
doing the budget any favors." Mr. Richardson said given that the government doesn't appear to be
investigating a new road to budget repair, "it essentially means we are giving up." There are no
guarantees that Australia will extend much further its record of 23 years-plus without a recession, and
budget repair is needed, he said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0515 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are tracking Friday's gains in U.S. Treasurys. The
cut-off yield of a new 10-year government bond auction was at 1.590% Monday, slightly below market
expectations of 1.600%. That is seen as positive for the near-term outlook of the local bond market, says
a local trader. "Bond investor confidence is improving as a weakening inflation outlook due to falling oil
prices suggests the Federal Reserve may delay its monetary tightening until September," he says. The
bond market is shrugging off the outcome of Saturday's local elections. The most-traded 10-year bond
yield is at 1.5790% versus 1.5865% late Friday; the five-year bond yield is at 1.0675% vs 1.0847%.

0513 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian aviation industry margins are expected to remain weak over the next 12
months, as airlines compete to maintain market share amid strong growth in capacity, Moody's Investors
Service says in a note. Stiff competition from low-cost carriers will hurt EBITDA margins in the Southeast
Asian market, "but we expect the decline in profitability to stabilize, as airlines taper capacity growth,"
Moody's says. Airlines in China will face margin erosion due to a weaker local economy and competition
from the country's rapidly expanding high-speed rail network. Southeast Asian carriers will focus on
cost-cutting and Moody's predicts more restructuring in the industry. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)

0510 GMT [Dow Jones] China's policymakers have said they would tolerate slower economic growth as
long as the labor market holds up, but RBS economist Louis Kuijs says that slower migrant employment
suggests that the country's labour market may not be as resilient as it seems. Migrant employment
growth in the third quarter slows to 1% from a year earlier, official data show. The downturn of the
property market, a major employer of migrant workers, has hit the labor market, economists say.
"Unfavourable news from the labour market or increased downward momentum of growth and/or prices

data will likely add to further pressure for easing steps. (liyan.qi@wsj.com)

0457 GMT [Dow Jones] A weaker-than-expected reading of China's purchasing managers' index is
hurting Japanese shares with large exposure to China. China's official PMI, as announced midday
Monday, fell to 50.3 in November from 50.8 the preceding month, sparking selling in Komatsu (6301.TO),
down 0.7% at Y2,792 and Hitachi Construction Machinery (6305.TO), down 0.1% at Y2,559. "For shares
sensitive to China's economic growth trend, this is bad news, and probably justifies China's central bank
interest rate cut/easing measures taken a few days ago," says an equity trading director at a European
brokerage. "A lot of the selling is probably baked in already, though. The 'China slowdown' story is
well-known; the only question is how severe it might be." (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0443 GMT [Dow Jones]The Indonesian rupiah is trading near an 11-month low of 12,270 against the
dollar amid sharply lower oil prices. The rupiah is also weighed by a weak HSBC's manufacturing
purchasing managers index for Indonesia, which fell to the survey record low of 48.0 in November from
49.2 in October. The data also showed a narrower-than-expected October trade surplus of $20 million,
compared with a forecast of $25 million. The USD/IDR daily price chart is positive-biased as the five-
and 15-day moving averages are advancing. Further upside in USD/IDR may encounter resistance at
12,278 (Dec. 27 swing high), and then at 12,600 (Nov. 21, 2008 swing high). Support may be
encountered at the upper 20-day one-standard deviation Bollinger Band (now at 12,207), and then at the
10-day exponential moving average (now at 12,188). Spot USD/IDR is at 12,268. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0440 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar has fallen to a fresh four-month low against the New
Zealand Dollar (NZ$1.0804) driven by a widening in the Australia/New Zealand unemployment rate
differential to 0.7%, after New Zealand's unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to 5.4%, while
Australia's unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in early November, says Richard Grace, global head of
currency strategy at Commonwealth Bank. He adds a subsequent 12 basis point widening in the
Australia/New Zealand two-year swap spread to 123 basis points from its early November level of 111
basis points make yields in New Zealand looks more attractive to fund managers versus Australia. Grace
says a series of daily declines in the price of iron ore has put more pressure on the Australia/New
Zealand terms-of-trade differential.(james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter: @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0433 GMT [Dow Jones] Pola Orbis Holdings (4927.TO) is up 7.1% at Y4,515 after raising its FY
guidance after the Nov. 28 market close. The mail-order cosmetics and health-and-beauty-aid product
retailer now expects to earn a net profit of Y9.7 billion, up from Y8.8 billion in its prior view. The
company also raised its full-year dividend payout outlook to Y187 per share, up from the initially stated
Y87. Measures to improve earnings in the company's Chinese business are potential catalysts for the
next FY, says Credit Suisse analyst Masashi Mori. "The domestic business should remain solid on stable
sales growth and the full contribution of production-system streamlining," he adds. "The current
substantial dividend increase also reconfirms the company's commitment to returning value to
shareholders and boosting capital efficiency." (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0429 GMT [Dow Jones] Japanese life insurers will likely help support USD/JPY uptrend to go beyond
120 as a buyer of greenback with their low-profile but steady dedication, says Taisuke Tanaka, chief FX
strategist at Deutsche Securities, in a note. Six-month business performance results of 9 major Japanese
insurance companies shows their assets outside Japan ballooned 15% from six months ago. (The gain is
somewhat exaggerated by the JPY weakness but increased foreign bond buy is cited.) A breakdown
shows the USD-denominated assets to make up 56.2% of the total from 53.7% six months ago. At the
same time, their currency hedge ratio toward foreign assets is down to 54.0% from 57.0% a year ago and
62.7% two years ago. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

0428 GMT [Dow Jones] At least two leading forecasters now believe Japan's economy did not contract in
the July-September period, after receiving fresh capital spending data Monday. When the government
gave its first estimate in mid-November for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, it shocked
markets by reporting a 1.6% contraction, at a price-adjusted, annualized pace. Following a sharp
downturn the prior quarter, due to the April sales tax hike, the economy seemed to have fallen into the
popular definition of recession--two straight periods of negative growth. But the finance ministry's
corporate survey Monday showed capital spending rose in the quarter, contrary to the assumption
plugged into the original GDP estimate that the number had fallen. Both Barclays and JP Morgan issued
reports saying they now estimate GDP was flat for the quarter. The government reports its revised
estimate next Monday, December 8. (jacob.schlesinger@wsj.com)

0426 GMT [Dow Jones] The Reserve Bank of India will probably keep its main policy interest rate at 8%
tomorrow, writes Spiro Sovereign Strategy in a research note. But if it really wanted to loosen monetary
policy, the RBI has "sufficient credibility" to do so without hurting its price-stability credentials or looking
like its hand was being forced, the London-based consultancy says. Thanks to RBI Gov. Raghuram
Rajan's hawkish tone and policy decisions in his 15 months in office, he is in a "Nixon-in-China" position
to cut rates without being accused of going soft. That goes a long way toward differentiating India from
other large emerging markets, Spiro says. Turkey's central bank, for instance, began cutting rates this
spring despite a surge of inflation. Likewise, Brazil, South Africa and Russia are looking at rate hikes over
the next year despite near-recessionary conditions. Rajan hardly has room for complacency, however:
The inflation battle is far from conclusively won, and economic growth decelerated in the third quarter.

0417 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares of Indian jewelry companies jump after the central bank late Friday
ended one of the restrictions on gold imports put in place last year to reduce the country's chronic
current-account deficit. The Reserve Bank of India said the government had decided to end the
requirement that 20% of the gold imports by jewelers have to be re-exported as jewelry. Jewelers were
demanding the removal of this restriction as it had led to smuggling raising the cost for them. "Even if
India's gold imports now pick up, the threat of the current account deficit ballooning to previous levels is
slim," says Capital Economics. Titan (500114.BY), India's largest jewelry retailer, rises 6.5%, Gitanjali
Gems (532715.BY) surges 20%, Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (534369.BY) jumps 15%, while PC Jeweller
(534809.BY) gains 11%. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)
