Sydney (Platts)--16Oct2014/338 am EDT/738 GMT (Updating with detail and analyst comment)
Australia's Woodside Petroleum has raised its full-year oil and gas production target by 3% after posting
output of 25.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter of 2014, up 7.2% from 23.5 million boe
in the second quarter and 15.1% higher year on year.

Woodside's revised production target for this year is 93 million to 95 million boe, reflecting "continuing
strong operating performance across all assets," the company said Thursday. The new guidance is up
from an original 86 million to 93 million boe, which was raised to 89 million to 94 million boe at the
end of the second quarter.

Woodside attributed the quarter-on-quarter rise in production mainly to higher LNG and condensate
production from Australia's North West Shelf and Pluto LNG, partly offset by lower oil output at the
company's Australian assets. The strong year-on-year increase in output was mostly the result of higher
LNG reliability at the North West Shelf and Pluto and the restart of the Vincent FPSO in late 2013, the
company added.
Woodside's sales volume for the third quarter was 24.5 million boe, up 14% from 21.5 million boe in the
second quarter and 17.2% higher than 20.9 million boe in the corresponding period of 2013. Sales
revenue for the period was $1.959 billion, marking a 16.7% increase from $1.679 billion in the second
quarter and a 46.4% rise from $1.338 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.
"Production and revenue came in stronger than our expectations," Hong Kong-based analysts with
Bernstein Research said in a note. "Despite the increased production target in 2014, we anticipate that
production growth will flatten off in 2015 and the next wave of organic production growth will not come in
until 2020."
During the quarter, Woodside signed an agreement with Cheniere Energy to purchase around 850,000
mt/year of LNG from the second production train at its Corpus Christi liquefaction project in Texas, which
is expected to start up in late 2019.
The company also had exploration success during the period, with the Toro-1 exploration well in permit
WA-430-P off Western Australia intersecting around 65 meters of net gas.

Meanwhile, Woodside has continued to expand its international exploration portfolio, finalizing farm-in
agreements with Chariot Oil & Gas at the prospective Rabat Deep permits offshore northwestern
Morocco and with Beach Energy at the prospective Lake Tanganyika Basin in western Tanzania.
The company also acquired a participating interest in an exploration, exploitation and production sharing
contract for Block F15 in the Gabon Coastal Basin, offshore southwestern Gabon. Subsequent to the
quarter end, Woodside agreed with Noble Energy and Glencore to farm into the Tilapia production
sharing contract off the coast of Cameroon.
Woodside is Australia's second-largest oil and gas producer behind BHP Billiton and its biggest LNG
producer, via its one-sixth of the North West Shelf joint venture and 90% of Pluto. The company's key
existing growth opportunity is its operated Browse LNG project offshore northwestern Australia.

fields using three floating production facilities, each with capacity of about 3.9 million mt/year of LNG
and 22,000 b/d of condensate. The project is a joint venture between Woodside, Shell, BP, Japan
Australia LNG and PetroChina.

During the quarter Woodside concluded basis of design documentation for Browse and continued
engineering and non-technical activities. The company is aiming to be in a position to make a
recommendation to enter front-end engineering and design late in 2014 and a final investment decision in
the second half of 2015.

"The weaker macro environment, increases in US LNG export approvals and Russia gas exports to
China make the sanction of Browse FLNG increasingly difficult," the Bernstein analysts said.

"Woodside ... plans to enter FEED in late 2014. We think this will be challenging," the analysts added.
"Given Shell's focus on capital discipline and PetroChina being in no hurry following their Gazprom deal,
we expect that FEED decision will slip into 2015 and FID will be pushed into mid-2016 at the earliest."
According to the analysts, the company's limited organic growth opportunities before Browse start-up in
2020 will tempt it to look to mergers and acquisitions. "We believe that Woodside will seek M&A for
growth with ideal investment size in the range of US$1 billion to $5 billion," they said.
