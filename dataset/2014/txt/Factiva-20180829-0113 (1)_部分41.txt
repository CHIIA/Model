"Gut feeling is we are going up, but I am not going to defy sentiment .. down 10"

"Maree" said, "While there was a sharp fall in Northern Hemisphere stocks last night I cannot see we are
in the same over valuation mode here. Fair enough, some of what is going on in the north will filter
through to us. But there is something to gain from the FTA, even if only minimal. My gut feeling is still that
we are going up, but I am not going to defy sentiment, so I'll call the market down 10".
Maree added, "The slow down in China from 8+ to +7% or a little below is still fantastic growth, if in fact it
is happening, compared to the northern hemisphere. Our market has factored in a lot of negatives but we
did not rally as much as the north, we are not in the same boat even if we take the lead from what is
happening in the northern hemisphere. Our falls will be muted compared to their falls. We have $1.6/1.7
trillion in super money. Although a lot of it is held in cash or goes into property, a lot of it also goes into
stocks."

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 9.1 points to 5413.7 last evening.

Business confidence falls to 4 points in March from 7 in February
The National Australia Bank's business survey revealed business confidence fell from 7 points in
February to 4 points in March while sales fell and employment improved slightly.
Business sentiment was also weakened by the recent elevated levels of the Australian dollar, uncertainty
over the global economy and fears of a "belt tightening" federal government budget in May, the National
Australia Bank's business survey showed.
Despite the soft readings, most industries recorded a lift in conditions, particularly in the mining sector.
But the transport industry, as well as the "bellwether" wholesale sector, weakened significantly, NAB said.

Page120of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Conditions facing wholesalers deteriorated heavily in March and are by far the weakest of all the
industries covered in the survey - a concern given its characteristics as a bellwether industry," NAB said.

At the same time, indicators suggest there would be little improvement over the next few months, as
forward orders remained soft and firms continued to de-stock, the bank said, adding that capacity
utilisation suggested there was still significant slack in the economy.
More on FTA with Japan immediate win for dairy. Beef tariff cut to be phased in

"The Age" said the average Japanese car will cost about $1000 less for Australian consumers.

Japan will cut the tariff on Australian frozen beef to 19.5% from 38.5% and Australian fresh beef to 23.5%,
to be phased in over 15 years or more.
*Cheese exports for Australian producers become immediately duty free. They will also benefit from a
preferential duty free Australia only quota.

Quotas will also grow for ice cream and frozen yoghurt exports.
Australian milk products such as protein concentrates and casei nwill be immediately duty free to
Japanese markets.

Tariffs on canned products such as tomatoes, peaches and pears, and fruit and vegetable juices will be
eliminated.

*CAB: Looks at impact from NSW Govt intention to set service fee at 5%

Page121of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Cabcharge Ltd advised that the NSW Government intention to set the service fee at 5% will result in
Cabcharge's current taxi service fee income of $28 million halving to $14 million. While this may be
mitigated by an increase in electronic payments generally and/or a decrease in the level of competition in
the transaction processing market in NSW, or a reassessment of the merchant fee arrangements with
taxi networks and incentive payments to drivers that together total approximately $10 million annually in
NSW.

Cabcharge added that while the NSW government expects savings from a lower service fee will be
available to all passengers, it will in fact only be available to those who choose to use credit/debit cards
and who can sometimes claim it as a tax deduction.

Cabcharge added it has been operating mobile phone taxi booking apps in NSW since 2009, that meet
the full range of customer service, privacy and safety standards that apply to other modes of booking
services.

However, many clients including people with disabilities, many aged people and disadvantaged people
prefer to use the telephone or web based booking services which CAB continues to fully service.

*SPN: Full court of Fed Court rules in ATO's favor, SPN considering appeal

SP AusNet advised with regard to its dispute with the Australian Taxation Office, the Full Court of the
Federal Court of Australia has delivered judgement against SPN in relation to disputed tax amended
assessments relating to the 2001 to 2006 income years. The current after tax disputed amount is $86.7
million representing $54 million of primary tax plus an interest component of $32.7 million. SPN paid
$30.6 million to the ATO in October 2011 in relation to the dispute as part of a 50/50 payment
arrangement. Following the Federal Court's first instance decision, a Profit & Loss charge of $86.7 million
was recorded by SP AusNet in its accounts for the financial period ended September 30.

SPN is seeking legal advice and will make a decision on whether to apply for special leave to appeal. (Apr

*AQP: Offers to purchase convertible bonds/followed by rights issue

Aquarius Platinum Ltd announced it is launching a tender offer today that will expire on April 11 unless
extended, to purchase a minimum of $US15 million and a maximum of $US225 million in principal
amount of the outstanding $US300 million convertible bonds with a maturity date of December 18 2015.
Following expiry of the tender offer the company proposes to make a partly underwritten rights issue to
raise not less than the minimum Tender Offer acceptance level of $US150 million, details to be
announced after expiry of the tender offer.
However Aquarius believes, given the existing convertible bonds convert at $US6.578 per common
share, subject o adjustment on the occurrence of certain events, it is thought highly unlikely that existing
convertible bond holders wil chose to exercise their conversion rights prior to the maturity of the Existing
Convertible bonds, that the company will be required to redeem at their principal amount on their final
maturity date of December 18 2015.
The boar believes investor uncertainty on whether Aquarius Group will be able to repay any portion of the
Existing Convertible Bonds that remain outstanding weighs on the common shares.
With the operations having returned to more sustainable levels, and with about $US64 million before tax
to be received from the sale of its 50% share and loan in the Blue Ridge mine and its 50% effective
interest in the Kruidfontein prospecting right, the company intends to use the proceeds to strengthen the
balance sheet.

*KBL: DFS at Sorby Hills Ag-Pb-Zn Project to begin, production in 2015
KBL Mining Ltd announced following approval of the development of the Sorby Hills Project by the WA
Environmental Protection Authority, the Bankable Feasibility Study will now commence.

It is the largest undeveloped near surface Ag-Pb-Zn resource in Australia with Global Resource of 16.7Mt
at 4.5% Pb, 0.7% Zn and 52gpt Ag at a 2.5% Pb cut off.

Stage 1 development is envisaged as a 400,000 tpa open cut operation producing approximately 20,000
tonnes Pb and 710,000 ozs of Ag in concentrate.

Stage 1 is envisaged to have a 10 year mine life based on the C and DE Deposits which account for only
27% of the global resource base. Subsequent development should extend the mine life to more than 25
years, subject to necessary government approvals.

With substantial infrastructure already available, the project can be fast tracked to production,
commencing in 2015.

*RXL: Positive results from testwork on Camelwood Ni sulphide deposit

Rox Resources Ltd announced from preliminary metallurgical testwork on samples from the Camelwood
nickel sulphide deposit at Fisher East project in Western Australia, high concentrate grades of 14/17%Ni
and low MgO content have been produced with 91/95% nickel recovery for primary massive sulphide.
High grade concentrate was also produced for transitional semi massive (head grade 2.4% Ni) sample.
The preliminary disseminated sulphide sample contained a significant amount of talc, which contains high
amounts of MgO, requiring an additonal talc pre-float which removed about 34% of the MgO before the
sulphide flotation stage. A concentrate grade of 8.1% Ni was achieved with Ni recovery of 60%. MgO
content was low at 2.5% MgO and the Fe/Mg ratio was 16, indicating a suitable smelter project.
