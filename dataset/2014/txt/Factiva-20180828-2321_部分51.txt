BrisConnections' sale plans for its $2 billion AirportlinkM7 toll road look set to be derailed after its
largest debt-holder acquired a blocking stake late last week.
Street Talk can reveal Macquarie Bank held a reverse auction on Friday to snaffle $100 million worth
of BrisCon's debt. Macquarie, already BrisCon's biggest debt-holder, with a 20 per cent stake in the
lending group, now owns more than a third. This means the bank can effectively block a potential
sale process or hand control to another party.

As previously reported by Street Talk, Macquarie has been seeking to delay the AirportlinkM7 toll
road sale for some time. It argues the road could be worth significantly more in the future. As
BrisCon's bolted-on group of original backers have offloaded their loans to hedge funds,Macquarie
has been lobbying its cause in Asia and the United States as it looks to pick up more debt.

Macquarie's emergence as the king-marker in BrisCon's future comes at a torrid time for the bankrupt
toll road operator. Its receiver is suing planning and project management firm Arup over bungled
traffic forecasts for Airportlink, alleging Arup made a series of representations concerning the annual
and daily traffic volumes and revenue forecasts from 2007 that were misleading and negligent.

Meanwhile, distressed debt hedge funds have flocked to BrisCon's register in the past six weeks,
taking positions previously held by traditional lenders such as ANZ Banking Group and Société
Générale.

BrisCon receiver PPB Advisory and advisers have since met the road's new owners, which include
Centerbridge Partners, Strategic Value Partners, King Street Capital Management, Silver Point
Capital and Davidson Kempner.

Macquarie declined to comment when contacted by Street Talk over the weekend.
Elsewhere, Fosun, China's largest privately held conglomerate, is poised to secure its first takeover
of a listed Australian company after gaining more than 50 per cent of acceptances for its
$474 million cash takeover of ROC Oil.
Fosun will declare to the market on Monday that its offer is now unconditional. The Chinese
behemoth swooped on ROC in August with a knock-out cash bid – scuttling a controversial all-scrip
merger with larger rival Horizon Oil.
