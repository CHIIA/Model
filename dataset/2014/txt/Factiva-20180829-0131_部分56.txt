MELBOURNE: A third consecutive year of weak uranium prices has led to Paladin Energy's half-year
net loss increasing to $US255 million.
The uranium producer does not expect any short-term improvement either, shutting one of its two
producing mines last week and reducing production guidance for the year. But Paladin predicts the
nuclear power industry will recover and the long-term future will be positive for uranium producers, with
the current range of mine closures and lack of investment in new supply leading to sharp price rises.

Chinese giant China National Nuclear Corp last
year agreed to pay Paladin $US190 million for a 25 per cent stake in the Langer Heinrich mine in
Namibia.
The company's shares were steady at 47.5.
Paladin's loss widened by 32 per cent from a $US193.5 million half-year loss last year.
The result was inflated by a $US226.5 million impairment on its Queensland exploration assets.
Stripping those out, Paladin's gross result was a $US29.3 million loss compared to an $US11.3 million
profit last year.
It blamed the loss on a 21 per cent fall in uranium prices and higher impairment of inventory at the
loss-making Kayelekera mine in Malawi.
