is an economic recovery happening in the US. The malls are empty, Las Vegas is very quiet - and it was
one of the big seasons for travel. Workers are low paid, and eking out their salaries with whatever they
can make on the side. The US is going to have very low interest rates for quite a while as yet".

ECO NEWS

Australian job advertisements in newspapers and on the internet rose for a third straight month in March,
a further sign that demand for labour is picking up after a long fallow period.
A survey by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed total job advertisements rose a
seasonally adjusted 1.4 per cent in March, from February when they had climbed a revised 4.7 per cent.

The average number of job ads per week was 132,925, from an upwardly revised 131,089 in February.
That was down 2.7 per cent on March last year, but a big improvement from the middle of last year when
the annual drop reached 18.8 per cent.

Page182of294©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Job ads on the internet rose 1.3 per cent in March to 128,786 and were down 2.3 per cent on the year.
Newspaper ads bounced 4.5 per cent, a rare increase amid a prolonged structural shift to other forms of
advertising.

"There is now clearer evidence that labour demand is strengthening," said ANZ chief economist for
Australia Ivan Colhoun. "Importantly, there has been strength in job advertising in some key industries,
including construction, education and health."

Official employment figures for March are due on Thursday and median forecasts are for a modest rise of
5,000 following a surprisingly large 47,300 increase in February. The jobless rate is seen staying at 6.0
per cent.

The ANZ job ads survey's correlation with employment has weakened over the last couple of years, in part
due to firms using other methods of reaching job seekers such as social media.

Record iron ore exports to China from Port Hedland in March
Bloomberg reported exports to China from Australia’s Port Hedland climbed to a record last month as

tons in February and 24.9 million tons in March 2013, the data show.

*BHP: Japanese steelmakers continue to resist monthly price sets for coking coal
The Financial Times in London reports a push by BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest resource company by
market value, to have coking coal prices set by an index-based pricing system has encountered further
resistance.

BHP has been attempting to establish market-linked pricing in the Asian market since 2010. However,
many steelmakers, particularly in Japan, continue to favour longer-term fixed pricing arrangements, which
give greater certainty over price and supply of brands they prefer.

In the latest pricing round, many of BHP’s rivals were able to settle quarterly contracts with major Asian
steel mills on the traditional fixed-price basis, at around $120 a tonne, according to traders. That was
down 16 per cent quarter-on-quarter and below the levels seen during the global financial crisis.

In contrast, Asian mills shunned BHP’s monthly index-linked offers and the Melbourne-based miner was
forced to sell a greater amount of coal directly into the Chinese spot market. The coal was sold at a
discount to the quarterly contract price, according to the McCloskey Coal Report.

“Japanese steelmakers continue to demonstrate support for the quarterly pricing system, prioritising
supply security and stability,” said Macquarie analyst Stefan Ljubisavljevic.

BHP declined to comment on the negotiations, the Financial Times reported.
