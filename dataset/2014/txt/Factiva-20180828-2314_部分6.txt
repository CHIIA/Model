As companies like Petronas prepare to make final investment decisions, the International Energy
Agency said Wednesday it expects the cost to produce and export liquefied natural gas from Canada to
be among the highest in the world - second only to Australia.

Widely considered the bible of energy forecasts, the Parisbased IEA released its World Energy Outlook
on Wednesday that showed the cost to extract, chill and ship natural gas from Canada could be higher
than some industry insiders had expected. The IEA puts the cost to export LNG from Canada between
$13/MBtu and $14/MBtu - depending on where the product is headed.

"It seems a bit high," said Vancouver-based energy lawyer Warren Brazier. Previous estimates for
Canadian LNG development put the cost in the $11/MBtu range.

The IEA's numbers show Canadian exports would be more expensive than American, Russian and
Africansourced LNG. Compared with the U.S., IEA data shows Canadian LNG would cost $1.80 more
per MB tu for exports to northeast Asia and $3.60/MBtu for exports to Europe.
Global consulting firm PwC's national energy leader Reynold Tetzlaff said the IEA's numbers wouldn't
cause potential LNG investors to panic. "I've seen a range between $12 to $14," Mr. Tetzlaff said. "I did
show some of those numbers to investors over the course of October and they didn't seem surprised."

The IEA's outlook also showed that global natural gas demand is expected to grow more than 50% by
2040, led by rising demand from China and the Middle East. Global LNG exports are expected to
double over the same time period.

Energy industry analysts and consultants have long warned that the nascent Canadian LNG industry
could see the same kind of cost overruns that have hammered Australian projects - and the IEA's report
showed Australian LNG would cost only between $0.40 and $0.90 more per MBtu than Canadian
product.

Project costs in Australia have skyrocketed as energy companies in the country work to develop
additional LNG export projects. According to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration
Association, there are currently three LNG projects operating in the country and seven more under
construction.

By contrast, there are no LNG projects operating or under construction in B.C. Petronas' Pacific
Northwest LNG project is widely considered the front-runner of the export facilities proposed for
construction on B.C.'s coastline. The company confirmed in an email to Bloomberg today that it viewed
the B.C.'s government's new LNG tax framework as positive, and that the company will continue
working with the province in an effort to come to a positive final investment decision, which is expected
in December, on its LNG project.

analyst Greg Colman said in an interview. As a result, companies like Petronas and Shell can use their
development costs instead of natural gas prices in calculating their LNG production and export costs.

In an October research report, Mr. Colman said that he believed Canadian LNG costs, which he
calculated at $11.25, were competitive not only with Australia, but with the U.S. "What we're saying is it's
a lot cheaper to do it in Canada than Australia," Mr. Colman said Wednesday. "Once you build the
facility, Canada would be a low-cost producer of LNG ... ."
