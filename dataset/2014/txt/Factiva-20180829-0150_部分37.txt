The S&P/ASX200 is down 13.8 points to 5295.3 at midday on lightish volume worth $1.5 billion. There
are 392 issues higher and 421 down. The SPI Futures is down 14 points to 5257 on light volume of 7932
contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 12 points to 4.11%.

*The banks have contributed 12.4 negative points to the index, resources have contributed 13.6 positive
points, property trusts have contributed 0.5 negative points, retailers have contributed 2.4 negative points
and Telstra has contributed 1.9 negative points.

*The Nikkei Dow futures is down 39 points to 15,680 points, Shanghai CSI physical is down 6.18 points to
2017.52, Hang Seng futures is down 94 points to 22,878. S&P futures is up 0.9 points to 1837.20,
Nasdaq futures is down 0.1 points to 3594.75. Dow futures is up 11 points to 16,336 points. Gold is up
$1.10 to $1241.30. Crude is up 11c to $94.07.

The strong buying in our resources stocks yesterday could also be explained by Citigroup's turning bullish
on the sector, particularly BHP, RIO and Xstrata yesterday - by the time the media got it (last night), the
report may have been several hours old. Meanwhile, the banks, reckoned earlier to be among the most
expensive, p/e wise in the world, continue to face selling, likely to also be some switching into resources.

"High will be 5313. Low will be 5285. Close at 5297, down 12 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open slightly
lower with our local futures contract down 4 points.

"While my work suggests a run into 5500 by late January or early February, we should be very open to
the thesis that it is an intermediate top. Overnight in the US, bellwether Goldman Sachs hit a 3-week low
on strong volume. Here in Oz, while yesterdays performance was impressive in terms of price, sector
leadership was toppish to bearish with the inflationary and defensive issues outperforming growth. "The
banks have largely sat out the rally over the past two days. And index leadership was also bearish. The
top in precious metals in 2011, and the top in bonds last year serve as a timely reminder that something
big is afoot in terms of liquidity. History reveals that equities are always last to receive this ebb.

"But none of this matters for today. The high will be 5313. The low will be 5285. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5297, down 12 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 63.7 points to 5309.1 last evening.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS

*AGI: Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd announced its Manufacturer & Distributor License applications
were approved by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at a meeting on January 26 in Mississippi. This
enables the company to manufacture, sell and/or distribute any gaming device or associated equipment
for use and play in the state of Mississippi.

The Mississippi market has approximately 36,000 devices spread over 33 locations and a number of
corporate customers with whom the company has existing and established relations.

Interim guidance

AGI said based on unaudited management accounts it expects to report profit before tax of approximately
$45 million, up 50% on the prior corresponding period. Results will be announced on February 25.

Page124of297©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*SUL: 1st half NPAT up 0.7% to up 2.3% on pcp/improved 2nd half expected
Super Retail Group announced group sales for the 26 weeks to December 28 are $1.096 billion, up 6%
on the prior comparative period (pcp).

Auto sales growth is 3.7% with like for like growth of 2.3%, Leisure growth is 8.1%, like for like growth is
1.6% and Sports growth is 6.2%, with like for like growth of 5.5%.

Gross margin has tracked in line with expectations in both the Auto and Sports division - the Auto division
gross margin is slightly ahead, and the Sorts division is below the pcp.

Gross margin in the Leisure Division is below expectation, mainly a result of higher than planned
promotional discounting across the division's three businesses during the Christmas sales period.
The group expects to report a NPAT of between $61/62 million for the half year, up between 0.7% to
2.3% over the pcp.

CEO and MD Peter Birtles said the overall result was below expectations, reflecting a number of short
term internal challenges across all three divisions. A number of initiatives to underpin gross margin
performance across all three divisions in the second half have been implemented.
The company will report its interim result on February 20.
