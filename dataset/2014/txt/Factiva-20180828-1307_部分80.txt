IT'S got a treasure ship and thanksgiving temple, a distinctive name and even a "panda paradise".
But a proposed $500 million Chinese cultural theme park north of Wyong experienced rocky feng shui
yesterday that included questions about the terms of a $10 million land purchase from Wyong Shire
Council, and a run-in with Disneyland.

Wyong mayor Doug Eaton and Australian China Theme Park Pty Ltd chairman Bruce Zhong
announced details of the "Chappypie China Time" theme park on a 15-hectare site at Warnervale
that Mr Eaton said would "blow people away".
The 12 stages will include a Forbidden City, Chinese gourmet area, "Spring Festival" square, a
thanksgiving temple of three buildings and statues of goddesses, a river with dragon boats,
landscaped garden and a "giant ship" that "celebrated Australia and China's shared maritime history".
But Australian China Theme Park is yet to lodge a development application for the project, and Mr
Eaton confirmed the company had paid Wyong Shire Council only $70,000 towards the $10 million
purchase of the Warnervale land.
Mr Eaton defended the contract as he expected the company to lodge its formal development
application for the first stage of the project, the thanksgiving temple, in the next few weeks to allow
public comment. The council could consider the application by year-end.

The revised plans allowing for rides prompteda media release from Mr Eaton yesterday, which
described it as a "Chinese-themed Disneyland" and "Chinese Disneyland for Warnervale".

The council late yesterday apologised to Disney Australia after a Disney representative contacted it.

The project "Isn't associated with Disney or Disneyland", a Disney Australia spokeswoman said to the
Newcastle Herald.

Despite the apology, Mr Eaton remained upbeat.

"You certainly don't see an investment of $500 million in a tourism project very often."
The 20-strong Chinese delegation included eightfrom the Shanghai Construction Company, one of
China's largest construction firms.
