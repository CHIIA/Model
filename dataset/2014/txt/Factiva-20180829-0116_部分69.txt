NEWS OF THE DAY

*Japan's core consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in February from a year earlier, posting a ninth straight
month of gains, government data showed, a sign the economy is making steady progress to overcome 15
years of mild deflation.
The year-on-year gain in the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh
food prices, matched economists' median estimate for a 1.3 percent gain.

It also followed a 1.3 percent gain in January and December, which marked the quickest rise since 1.9
percent in October 2008.
The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core
index used in the United States, rose 0.8 percent in the year to February.

It matched a high last hit in April 1998.

Page206of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*Japan's household spending fell 2.5% in February from a year earlier, the first dorp in six months vs up

*PAN: Further drilling around KUD 1525 does not explain its EM response

Panoramic Resources Ltd in a drilling update on Savannah North said since the announcement on March
3, when the underground drill hole KUD1527 was still in progress, further drilling in proximity does not
explain the strong off hole EM responses detected earlier in KUD1525 and KUD 1526. The current
interpretation is that the gabbroic unit is not considered part of the Savannah Intrusion, but possibly
related to the North Olivine Gabbro Complex situated to the north of the Savannah Mine. Further drilling
and DHEM surveying will be conducted.

PAN down 14 cents to 41 cents
