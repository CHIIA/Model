The Aurora Alice Springs Hotel on Leichhardt Tce is for sale. Its owner, Australian Property Projects
Group ) is selling two of its prime hospitality assets – the Alice Springs property and the Aurora Ozone
Hotel at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island.

The award winning Aurora Alice Springs has 109 4-star rooms. It has multiple income streams,
providing not only prime hotel accommodation but also the Red Ochre Grill , one of most reputable
restaurants in the NT.

CBRE’s David Kennedy and Don Watson-Brown have been appointed as the exclusive selling agents
for the high-profile hospitality properties.

“Multiple room types cater for families, international tourists and corporates alike, while additional
commercial/retail income streams help to underwrite the property’s trading performance,” Mr
Watson-Brown said.
“We’ve been fielding particularly strong interest in Australian hospitality assets from Chinese investor
groups.” Both hotels are being offered for sale in one line or individually and with vacant possession
providing buyers with the opportunity to rebrand the assets.Expressions of interest will close at 4pm
EST on Friday, September 5, at the offices of CBRE in Perth or Brisbane.
