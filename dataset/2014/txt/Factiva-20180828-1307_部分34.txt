Another quietish day in paradise with the market performing better than expected given the falls on the
Dow and the futures market overnight. After flirting with a sub 5500 level a few buyers stepped in mainly
in resources like BHP Billiton Limited (A$38.32, +0.8%), RIO Tinto Limited (A$65.82, +0.8%) and Iluka
Resources Limited (A$8.62, +1.8%) to save the day. Well, a relative save with the ASX200 closing down a
mere 6 to 5512. Financials bore the brunt of the falls today led by the big four with falls around 0.2 to
0.3%. (Late rally saving their blushes) Wealth managers stuttered as Macquarie Group Limited (A$56.92,
-0.8%) continued to feel unloved by investors, Henderson Group PLC. (A$4.44, -0.2%) have numbers
tonight and other fundies like Magellan Financial Group Limited (A$11.12, -3.2%) and BT Investment
Management Limited (A$6.39, -0.8%) slipped away.

Yesterday's star attraction Cochlear Limited (A$70.82, +2.6%) continued the advance as the shorts raced
to cover on an improving company outlook despite major brokers suggesting an underwhelm. Others in
the healthcare sector basked in the warm glow with Primary Health Care Limited (A$4.84, +1.9%), Sonic
Healthcare Limited (A$17.96, +0.4%) and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (A$4.37,
+0.9%) better whilst others shunned like Csl Limited (A$64.41, -1.5%), Mesoblast Limited (A$4.01, -2.4%)
and Greencross Limited (A$9.91, -2.4%). Telcos were better led by Thodey's Telstra Corporation Limited
(A$5.43, +0.4%) as we head into reporting season and the promise of capital returns and special
dividends. Although when management say that you won't recognise the business in ten years time that's
a worrying thought! But despite the internet tax coming, as the government moves to monitor all our mail
and web browsing, Singapore Telecommunications Limited (A$3.37, +0.9%), TPG Telecom Limited
(A$5.46, +1.3%), M2 Telecommunications Group Limited (A$6.27, +3.1%) and iiNet Limited (A$7.86,
+1.3%) all put in a good metatag effort today.

In the industrials Transurban Group (A$7.71, +1.7%) romped ahead despite media commentary on their
tax (or rather no tax) payments. Utilities also put on the gas with APA Group (A$7.39, +0.5%), Energy
World Corporation Ltd (A$0.36, +7.5%), Spark Infrastructure Group (A$1.905, +0.5%) and AGL Energy
Limited (A$14.59, +0.1%) shooting the lights out. Energy stocks ran out of energy with the leaders
slipping, Woodside Petroleum Limited (A$41.85, -0.7%), Oil Search Limited (A$9.32, -0.2%), Santos
Limited (A$14.05, -1.2%) and #CTX # to name a few.
Highlights for the day were Energy World Corporation Ltd (A$0.36, +7.5%), M2 Telecommunications
Group Limited (A$6.27, +3.1%), Skilled Group Limited (A$2.54, +2.4%), Cochlear Limited (A$70.82,
+2.6%), Downer EDI Limited (A$4.69, +2.4%) and #OFX# in the large ones and Range Resources
Limited (A$0.031, +24.0%) and Focus Minerals Ltd (A$0.012, unch). Lowlights included Bradken Limited
(A$4.29, -5.5%), #XRO#, Energy Resources of Australia Limited (A$1.275, -3.8%), Orica Limited
(A$20.67, -3.2%) and Arrium Limited (A$0.775, -3.1%) in biggies and Panoramic Resources Limited
(A$0.86, -8.5%), Ausdrill Limited (A$0.97, -8.9%)(more write-offs in the mining services sector) and
#GOR#. Volume was uninspiring at $3.5bn.Aussie dollar at 93c and digital tulips at $626 (haven't they
been steady!!) Gold steady at $1291.
In a land far, far away, Asia that is, Tokyo fell 1.1% and HK and China down 0.5%. expect a Dow rally
tonight I suspect. Stocks and Stories Recent house listing Regeneus Ltd (A$0.285, unch) has gone into a
trading halt as it seeks to raise more money.

between $60-90M and a change in their tax status in Mali! Seems that mining services is still not a fun
place to be.
BC Iron Limited (A$3.39, -0.6%), one of the smaller iron ore players in the Pilbara, predicts the iron ore
price will head above $US100 per tonne over the next six months as demand for the company's product
remains strong.

Adelaide Brighton Limited (A$3.58, -0.8%) has snapped up a couple of rival cement companies an outlay
of around $174 million, South Australian company Direct Mix Concrete and Southern Quarries (DMC)
and Queensland's BM Webb Construction Materials. It has also renewed a long-term cement supply
contract in South Australia.

Ardent Leisure Group (A$2.51, unch) has announced it will pay $32.5m on eight Fitness First health clubs
in Perth. The acquisition will be funded via a $50m institutional share placement, with the balance of the
cash to be used to grow the company's Main Event business in the US. Once they sign those contracts it
will prove impossible to get out of them.
Orica confirmed today that it is looking to pursue separation of its chemical division in a proposed billion
dollar deal.
Tasmanian diary company #BAL# spent its second day as a listed company having risen 30% since
coming on a day ago. Not Happy Jan! Jan Cameron having sold her stake pre IPO. Not been a good
week for her really after settling for a $13m fine for trading whilst insolvent in her Retail Adventure
business that went kaboom!! . Tomorrows News Today

German factory orders dropped by the most in more than 2 1/2 years in a sign that tension with Russia is
having a serious effect. Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, slid 3.2 percent in June from
May. Economists forecast an increase of 0.9 percent.

RIO Tinto Limited (A$65.82, +0.8%) and Henderson Group PLC. (A$4.44, -0.2%) tomorrow with big things
expected from RIO. Outlook statement will be crucial. Same as it ever was.

Sprint has abandoned its pursuit of T Mobile after failing to win approval from authorities. Murdoch pulls
the pin on its Time Warner bid too and hedge funds in the US are now shorting IPOs listed by Private
Equity. Hardly seems in the spirit of the game! And talking media companies Huffington Post is launching
a Arabic edition.

Apple v Samsung is over. Called off outside the US as the two smart phone giants call a truce! Now if only
the Palestinians and the Israelis could do the same forever that would be good too!!!

Big question seems to be will the Russians invade Ukraine. Poles seem to think so and they have form in
this department. If they continue to amass troops on the border what are they going to do? NATO says
there are 20,000 troops on the border. Well they are not there for a picnic!

Ricky Gervais is returning as David Brent in a film chronicling Brent's reinvention as a rock star!

52 Tugboat drivers in Port Headland are due to go on rolling four hour stoppages in the next few days as
negotiations over pay break down. Now these guys earn between $280,000 and $390,000 a year so not
sure I have too much sympathy for them.

Good to see the world's richest height challenged entrepreneur reach down into his pockets for some
loose change as Bernie "is that all' Ecclestone was let off from a trial for corruption with a $100m fine
instead. The man on the receiving end of the alleged bribe got 8.5 years in jail! Must have raided the
change jar to fund that one. Shame that only $1m went to a kids hospital and $99m to the state. Would
have been nice the other way round. Eddie is now looking into a similar deal in NSW!
Take heed this is a brilliant idea. In the UK, Waitrose, in partnership with logistics companyByBox, will set
up refrigerated lockers from this autumn in Gatwick's two terminals, enabling travellers to pick up their
groceries on the way home having pre ordered them. Click and collect is huge in UK and getting bigger.
Only a matter of time people, only a matter of time.

And in the UK there will be 300bn text messages sent in 2014. Flirting has doubled since 2013!
