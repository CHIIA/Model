Bulk metal - Slips to below $US100
As the price of iron ore slipped below $US100 a tonne for the first time in nearly two years, miners
said they would continue to focus on driving down costs.

Iron ore, measured out of the Tianjin port in China, lost a further 2.2 per cent overnight on Monday,
sliding to $US98.50 per tonne, its lowest point since September 2012. The bulk metal has slumped
6.6 per cent in May and has pushed deeper into bear market territory, down 26.6 per cent for the
year.
Following iron ore's slide this year, Fortescue chairman Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest has seen his
company's share price and personal fortune tumble. At Fortescue's 2014 peak of $6.23, Mr Forrest's
fortune was worth $6.43 billion. Since then, Fortescue's share price has plunged 26.8 per cent to
$4.39, wiping $1.91 billion from Mr Forrest's stake.
Diversified miners are ramping up iron ore production, while single-metal miners continue to add to
supply, ultimately leading to oversupply and a further slump in the iron ore price. Managing director
of minnow Grange Resources Wayne Bould said iron ore prices were at "pretty unsatisfactory" levels
and he had witnessed a major effort from buyers to push iron pellet prices lower in 2014.
Grange requires a long term average iron ore price in the low $US80 per tonne range, and given it
still has more than $100 million of cash in the bank, he was confident his company could still be
profitable at current levels.
His company is studying low cost ways to develop its Southdown project in WA, and Mr Bould said
Grange would cut its cloth to whatever price was necessary.
A $US10 movement in the iron price translates to a $US2.1 billion difference to Rio Tinto's bottom
line, and $US1.2 billion for BHP Billiton, roughly half as exposed as its rival, according to Credit
Suisse figures for the 2015 year. Or when applied to earnings, the Credit Suisse figures show a
$US10 price movement had a 20 per cent impact on Rio and 9 per cent on BHP.
Atlas Iron boss Ken Brinsden said the iron ore price was outside his control but he didn't sweat over
the short term moves. "We will continue to focus on those things we can control and in particular
growing our production base, controlling costs."
BC Iron managing director Morgan Ball said the surprising thing about the current iron ore price fall
was that the Australian dollar had not responded, although he expects pressure to remain on the
currency.
BC Iron has earned a reputation as one of the biggest dividend payers in the iron ore industry, and
has vowed to pay out between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of net profits after tax to shareholders.

why the iron ore price had dipped below $US100 a tonne for the first time since September 2012.

"Some traders have been caught in the liquidity crunch and have been forced to sell," he said.

Mr Ji said banks had been tightening credit this year and were demanding deposits of up to 30 per
cent to finance cargos, double the previous level. The return of Chinese domestic iron ore producers
to the market has also impacted heavily on supply in the last month.
