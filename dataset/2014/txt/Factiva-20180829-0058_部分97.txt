SYDNEY — Australian food companyGoodman Fielder has accepted a A$1.4 billion (S$1.6 billion)
joint takeover offer from Singapore commodity giant Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment
firm First Pacific after the bidders lifted an initial proposal by 7.7 per cent.
The board of Australia’s biggest baker will unanimously recommend the 70-Australian-cents-a-share
proposal and let the bidders conduct due diligence for four weeks, the Sydney-based firm said in a
regulatory filing yesterday.

Wilmar, the world’s biggest palm-oil producer, already owns 10 per cent of Goodman Fielder. It will buy
out the Australian company with First Pacific through a 50-50 joint venture. A successful takeover
would add brands such as Meadow Fresh yogurt, Olive Grove margarine and Wonder White bread to
Wilmar and First Pacific’s Chinese and South-east Asia-based consumer businesses.

The revised offer on Thursday, up from the original 65-Australiancents-a-share one made on April 28,
gives Goodman Fielder an enterprise value of A$1.92 billion, equivalent to 7.9 times its A$243.7
million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in the most recent 12-month
period.

Rising incomes in nearby Asian markets have stoked interest in acquiring food-related firms in Australia.
About US$12 billion (S$15 billion) in deals have been announced in the country’s food and agricultural
sector over the past five years, including the offer for Goodman Fielder, showed data compiled by
Bloomberg. BLOOMBERG
