The Australian Industry Group Australian Performance of Manufacturing Index contracted for the
third month in a row in January, down 0.9 points to 46.7 points.

Seasonally adjusted, it remained in negative territory across all the major activity sub-indexes.

Some improvement was found in new orders and employment, with those sub-indexes contracting
at a slower rate compared with December, at -48.8 and 48.3 respectively.

Some sub-sectors, however, recorded growth, including food, beverages and tobacco at 54.0,
wood and paper products at 61.9, petroleum, coal, chemical and rubber products at 52.7 and
non-metallic mineral products at 57.6.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said the year is looking challenging for
manufacturers; however, some areas have positive signs of growth.

“Non-metallic minerals – which includes key building materials such as glass, bricks and cement –
has improved in response to the beginnings of a lift in residential construction," he said.

“Some encouraging signs are also evident in food and beverages manufacturing and in petroleum
and chemicals manufacturing, possibly due to the lower Australian dollar over recent months."
United Dairy Power sale locked in
