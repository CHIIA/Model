HONG Kong-based Pacific Alliance Group has seized control of one of North Sydney’s landmark
development sites by appointing receivers Ferrier Hodgson to the $400 million 1 Denison office tower
project.

The long-stalled development by Korean-backed Eastmark Holdings had fallen behind rival projects as
it was unable to lock down precommitments and top-tier tenants demanded steep incentives for
moving to the city’s north shore. Ryan Eagle and Peter Gothard of Ferrier Hodgson were appointed in
late October and have since been working to protect the site’s valuable development approval while
continuing to explore the sale of a small office stratum that is part of the site.

PAG is one of Asia’s top alternative investment management groups with $US11 billion ($13bn) of
funds across private equity, real estate and absolute returns.
The group bulked up in Australia last year with the purchase of about $600m worth of assets from GE
Capital’s suburban office portfolio. It has also emerged as an active financier. But it does not have a
local development presence and is seen as a seller of the site.
Local developers are likely to chase the opportunity to build a major tower on the site as the
fundamentals of the North Sydney market are improving and investors such as China’s Fosun are
chasing properties in the area.
Eastmark, run by Jin Yong Park, formally launched its project in September last year with hopes that
its proposed 30-level building would be the largest commercial tower in North Sydney, with floor
space of 40,270sq m.

However, the developer’s lack of familiarity with the local market saw it beaten to the punch by more
savvy Australian players.

A Leighton Properties project at 177 Pacific Highway forged ahead, with the 30 level A-grade building,
anchored by a head lease to the development group, quickly pre-sold to Singapore’s Suntec REIT for
$413m. Another office project mooted in North Sydney — by land owner Laing O’Rourke and listed
developer Mirvac Group — would also have an end value of about $400m.

Then Australian employee-owned Sinclair Knight Merz held talks with the pair last year. But the
engineering group’s merger with Jacobs Engineering set back any shift into the planned office tower,
to comprise 40,100sq m of space, at 100 Mount Street.

The three developments, if all went ahead, would deliver a combined floor space of 125,000sq m and
boost the number of workers in North Sydney by 6000.In April, a Singaporean group bought a small
empty office block next to the main Eastmark site from the Korean group for $12.5m. The buyer plans
to develop a hotel with more than 200 rooms on the site it picked up at 88 Walker Street.
