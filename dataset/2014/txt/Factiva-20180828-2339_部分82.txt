The following was delivered as the 2014 Dean Jaensch
Lecture at Flinders University, September 16.

In opposition, Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott were fond of
comparing their battles to become the nation’s leader to
climbing Everest.

The analogy was designed to convey the difficulty and
uncertainty of the political ascent. When a leader was
doing well, it was a caution against cockiness.

It can be equally applied to the situation of a prime
minister, who will ultimately be judged on how well he or
she uses their time at the summit and whether they
make the inevitable descent as long and productive as
possible.

It’s a matter of coming with the right stores and
equipment, coping with the rarefied air, avoiding
avalanches and snow drifts, and negotiating the often
steep and treacherous terrain.

In this lecture I’ll look at the arrival at the peak of our last
eight summiteers – Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser,
Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, John Howard, Kevin Rudd,
Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott.

First steps

A prime minister’s first year lays the groundwork for
what’s to come. It tells us much about the leader’s style
and substance. But it is not necessarily a predictor of
how their story will pan out. It’s possible to consolidate
after a bad beginning; equally, a good start can fade into
unfulfilled promise, or explode into spectacular disaster,
with what looks like impressive energy turning out to be
dangerous hyperactivity.

A number of factors will set the tone for this year.
Central will be the personality, vision, competence,
drive, work pattern and judgement of the leader.

Page208of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Also vital will be the preparation for government, what
had been promised in opposition, the quality and
cohesion of the team, and the external situation in which
the administration finds itself. If this latter changes, the
issue becomes whether the PM adapts or is
overwhelmed – or indeed, tries to turn a blind eye.

The chance factors that arise may be crises, disasters or
opportunities. A crisis or disaster can become an
opportunity. The Port Arthur massacre was Howard’s
chance to prosecute gun reform, which became a lasting
legacy. MH17’s downing showed Abbott as an assertive
leader in an international context. The global financial
crisis that confronted Rudd was a challenge of a very
different sort.

Some governments and their leaders will mark turning
points in the nation’s history.

Whitlam took power when indeed the times were
a-changin'. Australia was rethinking itself, with new
issues emerging or old ones taking a fresh turn. It was
the same, in a different way, with Hawke, who assumed
office when opening the Australian economy was
becoming imperative. Gillard’s ascent was a milestone
rather than a turning point: Australia’s first female prime
minister.

Each PM arrives in distinct circumstances, national or
personal or both.

Whitlam brought Labor to power after 23 years, its
previous experience of government virtually a
generation away. The Labor team combined
enthusiasm, impatience, innocence and inexperience.

Hawke was PM within weeks of becoming Labor leader;
he had none of the slog of heading an opposition.

Keating took over the job when he was half worn-out
from years as treasurer, with the government staring at
the spectre of defeat.

Fraser arrived in the most unusual and dramatic
manner, installed as caretaker PM by governor-general
John Kerr after he sacked Whitlam. This was a path
that, despite his immediately winning a thumping
election victory, cast doubts over Fraser’s legitimacy in
the minds of some.

Gillard, having staged a successful coup against her
prime minister, was burdened with a legitimacy legacy of
another sort.

Some prime ministers learn from the experiences or
failures of those who went before; they observe what
worked and what didn’t. (Needless to say, some ignore,
forget or choose to defy the history.)

The Hawke government was determined to distance
itself from the Whitlam one, which despite its

Page209of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.achievements had been dogged by poor management
and ill-discipline.

As Abbott approached the prime ministership, he’d have
been aware Liberal “dries” feared he might follow what
they saw as a cautious, do-little Fraser model.

A new PM must deal with a legacy from the last one.
This can be a political bonus (Hawke could usefully
contrast his approach with the divisiveness of the Fraser
years) or a distracting negative (Gillard inherited
problems with carbon pricing, mining tax and asylum
seeker policy from Rudd).
Energy in the first year can be absorbed by undoing
things (as we’ve seen with Abbott’s undoing of the
carbon and mining taxes).

Feeding the beast

In the more than four decades since Whitlam’s election,
there have been major changes in the external and
internal environments in which PMs operate. Let me
touch on just two: the transformation of the media
landscape, and the growth of the Prime Minister’s Office.

In the early 1970s television was reshaping the political
playground, but the process was in its early stages. The
media cycle was speeding to a quick march; today it is a
continuous sprint.

Whitlam’s undertaking to have a weekly news
conference seemed a significant promise. Now hardly a
day goes by that the PM is not out and about, doing one
or more electronic interviews or fronting reporters,
mostly at stand-up, so-called “doorstops”.

The relentless 24-hour news cycle has had many direct
and indirect implications for prime ministers. It is not only
that the demands are multiplied. The attention spans of
both media and audiences are shortened.

A prime minister’s desire to keep the media beast fed
can rush decision-making. Obviously certain decisions
are urgent, but a lot of freneticism is discretionary; more
time could be taken, leading to more considered action.

Over-exposure to politics, via an intensified media
coverage, has contributed to community cynicism and
accentuated a culture of complaint, which has made
reform harder to sell.

Paul Kelly argues in his new book Triumph and Demise
that “it is by no means certain that Bob Hawke and Paul
Keating would have succeeded in the contemporary
system”. This has set off a debate about whether good
leadership can prevail over the new circumstances.
Whatever one’s view on that, I think we can agree that
today’s environment makes the reform task tougher.

Page210of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The rise of social media is part of the acceleration, and
also interconnects the political process as never before.
It has another dimension for prime ministers; the internet
can become a cesspool of hate, as Gillard found. Abbott
has described it as “kind of like electronic graffiti”.

The burgeoning of the Prime Ministerial Office – known
around parliament simply as the “PMO” – is both a
source of strength and a potential vulnerability. A strong
and numerous staff, especially if combined with a
powerful Prime Minister’s department, gives a leader
greater ability to personally drive policy and to oversee
the work of ministers.

But it can also isolate the PM, limit the impact of
incoming advice; if it is used as an instrument of
excessive domination, colleagues will resent it. Today
the PMO exercises extensive and detailed control over
ministers, including in relation to the staffing of their
offices and what media the ministers and even ordinary
government MPs do.

The growth in ministerial and prime ministerial staff
started in earnest under Whitlam. In a position paper
prepared for him, Peter Wilenski (a Whitlam adviser in
government) described the PMO as:

a service organisation ensuring that no function
performed by the Prime Minister is overlooked, and that
each type of demand is attended to on an ongoing basis
in accordance with the instructions laid down by the
Prime Minister.

When he was simultaneously PM and Minister for
Foreign Affairs, Whitlam had a staff of 21; now, Abbott
has an office of more than 50.

Recipes for success or failure

In their first year, prime ministers face the huge
challenge of getting themselves and their team on top of
the job of governing. Bad habits set early can lead to
deep problems later.

To manage a government well, prime ministers must be
able first and foremost to manage themselves. In a
speech last year excoriating Rudd, former Labor
minister Nicola Roxon offered some “housekeeping tips
for members of a future Labor government”, many of
which are useful rules for a PM of either hue.

Roxon’s advice included: keep your focus high-level on
the things that really matter; be a good delegator; be
polite and persuasive; run a good diary; choose good
people; and accept you are not always right and can’t fix
everything.

We can examine the first year of prime ministers against
various criteria.

Did they come with a policy blueprint?

Did they arrive with substantial political capital, in terms
of legitimacy, popularity and seats?

Were they personally organised and disciplined and
have a good office?

Page211of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.How experienced was the team and did it hold together?

Was the government hit with unexpected developments
and how did the PM handle them?

How successfully did they get out the message – did
they run, in today’s jargon, a convincing narrative?

What were the assessments, within the beltway and by
the public, at the end of their first year and how did they
measure up to what happened later?

A year in, were they learning and growing?

1972: Gough Whitlam

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-
f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.co
m/files/59096/width668/3dbbhx6y-1410841053.png

Gough Whitlam certainly arrived as a man with a plan,
one that had been extensively presented to the nation
over two elections.

“The Program” focused on the life needs of the
Australian families, particularly those in the growing
sprawling suburbs, with promises of better schools, free
university education, a new health scheme and
improved cities.

For Whitlam, “the Program” was a political bible to be
implemented at all costs and with all speed. He was the
one PM in our list to have what amounted to an
obsession with keeping promises, which later became a
fault rather than a virtue when economic circumstances
changed.

The desire to get going fast led to the extraordinary
two-man ministry, which issued 40 decisions in a
fortnight.

Whitlam had a modest majority of nine seats and didn’t
control the Senate. The team was inexperienced: no one
had been a minister before. Whitlam initially also took on
the post of foreign affairs. No subsequent PM has held a
major portfolio.

Whitlam insisted no previous administration had come
better prepared for its tasks. Yet an enduring criticism of
his government was that it couldn’t handle the job. That
disconnect invites the question: what is the most vital
tool in the kit bag? Detailed policy? An administrative
blueprint? Flexibility?

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-
f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.co
m/files/59078/width237/nd9z7zbg-1410833892.jpg

In the Labor tradition, Whitlam had a ministry chosen by
the caucus; he allocated portfolios. He had the problem
of the entire ministry being in cabinet – something that
no subsequent Labor PM would tolerate – and caucus
had the final say on decisions. Ministers who had lost
out in cabinet could refight the case in caucus.

Hawke, the next Labor PM, would ensure he had both a
cabinet and outer ministry, and that cabinet solidarity
prevailed in the party room.

Page212of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.From early on, the Whitlam government faced
formidable resistance. Labor’s conservative opponents
had power centres in the Senate and the states, and the
link would become increasingly potent later. The Senate
– more difficult than the one Abbott faces – by the end of
1973 had rejected 13 bills, deferred 10 and amended
two.

From the get-go, Whitlam had trouble running his team.
This was partly because of Labor’s structural
arrangements at that time, but also because of his own
style.

Biographer Jenny Hocking notes “his inability to control
meetings and to manage difficult, determined,
personalities”.

Nor was Whitlam interested enough, or strong enough,
in managing the economy, a problem exacerbated by
having a weak treasurer. The government faced
worsening inflation (around 10% in September 1973 and
rising). The spending programs would be unsustainable.
Plans for cuts were unpopular.

A 25% tariff cut brought a backlash. A referendum for
Commonwealth control over prices and incomes, held
just after the one year anniversary (and opposed by
Hawke, who was president of both the ACTU and ALP),
would be lost. In October 1973 came the oil shock that
would later rock the economy.

At his first anniversary Whitlam boasted 244 bills had
been introduced and 90 commissions, committees and
task forces had been at work, and reeled off many
reform achievements.

Whitlam’s first year was marked by a flurry of activity,
including many big and some visionary decisions, driven
by a PM with a fixed agenda and inadequate
management skills. At the anniversary the economic
outlook was threatening and the polls were suggesting
he would lose an election held then.

1975: Malcolm Fraser

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-
f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.co
m/files/59084/width668/5252rp34-1410833922.jpg

His successor Malcolm Fraser started with a double
advantage. After his brief period as caretaker, he won
the 1975 election by a huge majority. And he had control
of the Senate, the only one of our eight to begin that
way.

And yet he approached government quite cautiously.

In his “Turn on the Lights” campaign Fraser promised
economies in spending. “Getting rid of extravagance will
make its own contribution to reducing the deficit,” he
said. Some Liberals regarded Fraser’s start as a missed
opportunity, especially to cut harder into spending
(although this was often in retrospect – much of the
public debate of the time was about cuts).

The political atmospherics were still affected by the
hangover of the dismissal. Apart from that Fraser,
despite his pre-election rhetoric, was not a small

Page213of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.government ideologue, but rather a traditional
conservative, believing in a significant role for
government.

Fraser himself had regrets about not using his early
opportunity to do more to tackle spending. He told
biographer Philip Ayres: “In retrospect, we should have
established an expenditure base that was totally
sustainable over a long period ahead,” and he noted that
he’d later told Margaret Thatcher to “get in with a broad
axe very quickly”.

He put some blame on Treasury and his cabinet.
Treasury secretary Fred Wheeler had advised not to go
further; as for the cabinet: “I’d proposed that
unemployment benefits for 16- and 17-year-olds should
be cut off … I couldn’t get my own cabinet to wear it”.

Of these prime ministers, Fraser was the first who
arrived with an agenda for and a need to cut spending.
The memoir he and journalist Margaret Simons
co-authored says:

The idea of limited resources and a limited government
role became commonplace over the next 30 years … In
Fraser’s time it was a new theme. Placing economic
management at the centre of politics was an important
part of Fraser’s legacy.

Fraser did use this 12 months to bring in some bold
reforms: a new family allowance paid to mothers;
income tax indexation; indexing of pensions; and
legislation for Aboriginal land rights.
The family allowance was a major equity move, helping
lower income families and women. Tax indexation was
an example of over-reach, which could not be sustained.
The land rights legislation was an important continuity
with the Whitlam government.

Ayres concluded that: “Generally, 1976 revealed
Fraser’s government to be far more reform-minded than
those on the left would ever have predicted in December
1975”.

By the anniversary, the most noted feature was the
dominance of Fraser himself who, backed by an
enhanced department of Prime Minister and Cabinet,
had his hands on everything.

Mike Steketee from the Sydney Morning Herald
observed, “After a year in office, few areas of
government administration and policy have been left
untouched by [his] personal imprint”.

The Fraser government would go on to win two more
terms, but left a mixed legacy. Paul Kelly concluded:
“Fraser’s dominance of his own time is not matched by
his imprint upon history”.

1983: Bob Hawke

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-

m/files/59098/width668/t4h9rwfh-1410841054.png

Bob Hawke pitched for office pledged to a more
inclusive style than the Fraser government. With his

Page214of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.slogan of “reconciliation, recovery, reconstruction”, he
declared “the first pledge I now make, a commitment
which embraces every other undertaking, is that
everything we do as a government will have the one
great goal – to reunite this great community of ours”.

Neal Blewett, a Hawke minister, later wrote that “Hawke
as Prime Minister was corporatist and bureaucratic by
instinct and presidential in style”.

Unlike Whitlam and Keating, Hawke did not see
parliament as his natural forum. His speech writer
Stephen Mills said that Hawke regarded parliament “with
the kind of disdain that the self-made businessman has
for an MBA course at a university”.

Hawke understood the need for order and process in
government; he was a skilled chairman of his cabinet;
ministers, Blewett records, “were generally on a light
rein”.

Most significantly, Hawke was elected on one platform
and implemented another. Anticipating that he would
find a different economic situation from the one that
formed the basis of the campaign, Hawke in the final
days before the election gave himself an “out” on
promises if circumstances required.

The day after his victory Treasury secretary John Stone
presented him with a $9.6 billion projected deficit. As
Blanche d'Alpuget later wrote:

While painful for Hawke’s election promises, the deficit
was electoral gold. Hawke had a huge economic
headache but also a huge stick with which to beat the
Opposition, and a huge lever for reform.

Hawke used consensus as a political tool. The accord
forged with the unions before the election provided a
powerful mechanism for achieving the government’s
economic and social objectives, delivering wage
restraint in exchange for improvements in the social
wage. Hawke’s bringing together of unions, business
and others in the April 1983 economic summit
showcased his approach. He was backed by a personal
office that was strong on both the policy and political
sides.

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-

m/files/59083/width237/h7btqwj4-1410833910.jpg

Before the end of the first year, the government had
taken one of its most momentous economic decisions –
the float of the dollar. That laid the path for later reform.

Just short of the government’s first anniversary
Medicare had been established, after the Fraser
government had largely dismantled its predecessor
Medibank.

Nevertheless, soon after the anniversary questions were
being asked about how reformist the government would
be. Later years would provide the answer: very.

Hawke had also shown he could manage a political
crisis. He was hit by a scandal involving a Russian spy
and a former ALP national secretary; he lost a senior

Page215of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.minister in the course of it, and had to appear before a
royal commission. But the damage was contained.

More electorally serious was the move to tighten
pension eligibility, which would come to haunt his next
election campaign.

Marking the anniversary, journalist Ken Randall
observed: “Hawke’s love affair with the voting public is
still running hot”. His approval was 74%, and approval of
the government 55%.

Hard times, however, were around the corner, with the
personal feeding into the political. Hawke’s second year
saw his reaction to his daughter’s drug problem, as well
as policy challenges contribute to a bad election
campaign and a loss of seats at the 1984 poll.

1991: Paul Keating

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-
f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.co
m/files/59080/width668/cvbfrftx-1410833894.jpg
Paul Keating, one of the two in our group who arrived
via a coup, became PM on the back of caucus fears that
Hawke mightn’t have a fifth victory in him. Keating’s first
year was about readying the Labor government for its
fight for survival, shoring up the defences, and turning
the heat back on the opposition.

But Keating himself was burdened by having as
treasurer presided over what he had infelicitously
described as “the recession that Australia had to have”.

When he became PM, unemployment was around 10%,
the Coalition well ahead in the polls, and he personally
was unpopular. But Keating had the skill set for the task
ahead, which was essentially a political one.

The opposition had a massive economic alternative
called Fightback! Hawke had had trouble countering it,
but Fightback’s radicalism – with a proposed GST,
drastic spending cuts, and bold health and industrial
relations plans – was always going to be scary to voters.

Keating’s attack style, simultaneously forensic and
ferocious and with the ability to make maximum use of
the parliamentary forum, was ideal for the demolition
task.

Keating quickly sought to deal with the economy with his
One Nation package, including tax cuts (later enshrined
as L.A.W.) to stimulate the economy. They proved to be
a landmine. John Dawkins, treasurer at the time, wrote
subsequently: “The promised tax cuts may well have
helped win the 1993 election but they became a huge
burden later”.

While the economy was the main preoccupation,
Keating – especially under the influence of speech writer
Don Watson – also started to frame a debate about
national identity, including republicanism, which he
continued in his second term.

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-

m/files/59097/width237/2wrz5fm5-1410841053.png

Page216of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.At the end of the first year, Keating delivered what
became famous as his Redfern speech, a national mea
culpa for Australia’s treatment of its indigenous people
and a rallying call for the future.

Years later Prime Minister Tony Abbott (a staffer to
opposition leader John Hewson at the time of the
address) told parliament: “I could not disagree with its
central point: that our failures towards Australia’s first
people were a stain on our soul. That was a watershed
moment for me, as for others”.

Earlier in 1992 the High Court had delivered the Mabo
judgement, which rejected the argument that Australia
had been terra nullius when white settlers arrived. Mabo
would be a highly testing second term issue.

The remarkable feature of Keating’s first year, I noted in
my contemporary assessment, was how he had boosted
Labor’s political fortunes while the unemployment
queues had lengthened rather than shrunk. “He has
taken the government from a despairing conviction that
it was headed for certain loss to a belief that it is at least
in there with a chance.”

In early December 1991, just before Keating displaced
Hawke, Newspoll had the government trailing the
Coalition 36%-51% on primary votes; a year later
Keating had turned that around to a Labor lead of 47%
to 42%. But survival had taken precedence over reform.

He would carry forward his success to clinch the
“unwinnable election”, but could not sustain the success,
becoming out of touch with the public and decisively
losing the 1996 election.

1996: John Howard

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-
f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.co
m/files/59095/width668/zv54z9qh-1410841044.jpg

In his autobiography, Lazarus Rising, John Howard
looks back on what he wanted to achieve when he won
office.

Among his goals were to rescue Australia from “debt
and deficit” (sound familiar?), “rebalance the narrative
about Australia’s past,” and “change Paul Keating’s
seemingly Asia-only foreign policy focus”.

Howard shared the Keating view that to change the
government was to change the country but “I did not
come to office resolved to turn the nation on its head”.
Here are the two strands of Howard: part conviction
politician, part pragmatist.

The first budget was tough but well-received, setting the
government up. In its initial year the government also
took a major step in industrial relations reform, including
introducing Australian Workplace Agreements.

The package had to be negotiated with the Australian
Democrats, who sanded the harsher edges.

The IR changes, especially after the compromises, were
moderate, a sharp contrast with WorkChoices years
afterwards, when the PM unleashed his ideology and

Page217of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.there was no Senate restraint to save him from himself.
The first year also saw legislation for the part
privatisation of Telstra.

The national gun laws, in the wake of the 1996 Port
Arthur massacre that killed 35 people, become a
landmark though unexpected Howard reform, one for
which he had to take on parts of his own constituency.

The year also lit what flared as the briefly dangerous
flame of Hansonism. After Pauline Hanson’s maiden
speech in September 1996, with its anti-Asian and
anti-indigenous views, Howard, understanding that the
sentiments resonated with some of his “battlers”, did not
go hard against her. His handling of Hansonism would
become a damaging issue for him, including within his
own party.

The Howard team suffered some early casualties,
victims of his tough code of conduct; later, the stance
became to defend not ditch frontbenchers in trouble.

In December 1996, the High Court handed down the
decision in the Wik case that said pastoral leases did not
automatically extinguish native title. Like Mabo for the
Keating government, Wik would pose a major political
challenge.

One year in, Howard said that from Fraser he had
learned the importance of keeping on top of the detail;
from Hawke the need for “keeping in contact with
people”.

The first anniversary assessments saw the government
as cautious, somewhat accident prone, starting on
reform, and making Australia a more conservative place.
Journalist Geoff Kitney noted:
In personality, they are as different as chalk and cheese,
but Howard is running his prime ministership in much
the same way as Bob Hawke did. Like Hawke, he
believes he is on the same wavelength as the voters. He
wants to bring about change at a pace that takes voters
with him and doesn’t leave them behind.

The big GST gamble was yet to come. Howard’s hope,
expressed after 12 months, of a decade-long
engagement would be more than fulfilled.

2007: Kevin Rudd

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-
f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.co
m/files/59101/width668/zcc52xhj-1410841062.jpg

After nearly a dozen years of Coalition government,
voters welcomed Kevin Rudd as a fresh face; they had
become tired of Howard, and reacted against the
extremism of WorkChoices. Paul Kelly described Rudd
as “a social moderate, a fiscal conservative and a
dedicated economic reformer”.

Page218of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In his election speech, Rudd spoke of “the new
challenges that we face in the future”: climate change,

His government’s first act – starting the process towards
the ratification of the Kyoto protocol – combined the
substance and symbolism of an issue that helped him to
power, and later would contribute to his undoing.

With the opening of parliament in 2008 came Rudd’s
historic apology to Australia’s indigenous people, one of
the most significant moments of his government.

In April, 1000 people gathered for the 2020 summit,
which Rudd described as “throwing open the windows of
our democracy, to let a little bit of fresh air in”. The
summit had something of the new century’s celebrity
politics – among delegates were actors Cate Blanchett
and Hugh Jackman – but also a festive 1970s touch.

It was very different from the grey-suited, workmanlike
meeting Hawke convened a quarter-century before,
although the biggest outcome was an economic initiative
– what became the Henry tax inquiry (something the
government planned to do anyway).

In the first year the Rudd government dismantled
Howard legacy policies in industrial relations and border
protection – the latter decision would soon backfire.

But the global financial crisis became the dominant
story, a drama that fitted Rudd’s style. He took a
prominent role internationally and strongly argued for the
G20 – which included Australia – to become the main
international forum for dealing with it.

In style Rudd, who’d broken Labor tradition by seizing
the right to choose his frontbench, was the classic
one-man band.

He ran an under-experienced office, which he favoured
over his cabinet, alienating ministers who didn’t feel
willing or able to stand up to him.

He centralised excessive power in the Strategic Budget
and Priorities Committee – the gang of four – himself,
Gillard, Wayne Swan and Lindsay Tanner. This was
necessary during the GFC but the kitchen cabinet would
go on to hold close too much of the decision-making for
too long.

Kelly assessed that Rudd “engaged in the most
centralised, novel and risky experiment in prime
ministerial power since Gough Whitlam”. In a review of
Rudd’s first six months, academic Anne Tiernan said:
“Senior sources report that it is ‘impossible to

Page219of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.exaggerate the degree of personal intervention by the
Prime Minister. It’s his personality’”.

He reportedly joked his office was “Stalag Kevin” - failing
to see this wasn’t funny.

David Epstein, chief of staff in 2008, gave a devastating
indictment of Rudd’s management problems. They
included an erratic work pattern, getting too little sleep, a
chaotic office, and a habit of commissioning multiple
briefs but then not reading them because other issues
became more pressing.

It would, of course, end in tears. The government went
on to keep Australia out of recession but individual
programs were badly administered. And key long-term
reforms were not successfully prosecuted.

2010: Julia Gillard

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-

Rudd’s style and fear of an election defeat led to the
extraordinary events installing Julia Gillard in June 2010.
The way she got the job would dog her first and other
years. This played out at several levels.

Many voters were mystified and some angry at the
overthrow of Rudd. They might have marked him down
in the opinion polls, but they were not finished with him.

Gillard said the change of leadership had been needed
because a good government had lost its way, but could
not properly explain this. Trying to deal with the
problems of the past also meant that she could not spell
out her agenda for the future.

She came to the prime ministerial job unexpectedly and
undercooked and did not have the time, opportunity, skill
or clear air to rise to what was needed.

Rudd from the start set out to undermine Gillard. This
began, disastrously, in the run up to the August election.
Almost certainly the leaks against her cost her majority
government.

Her own campaign for the election was bad, with her
statement that it was “time for me to make sure that the
real Julia is well and truly on display” and other errors.
Her promise that there would be “no carbon tax” if she
were re-elected would later lethally detonate the trust
issue.

The hung parliament meant that Gillard faced an
enormous task of keeping her minority government
together. This highlighted her negotiating skills but also
meant the government existed on the edge of
uncertainty, effectively exploited by Abbott as opposition
leader.

Page220of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Minority government led to the ill-judged alliance with
the Greens, when Labor did not need a formal pact
because the Greens had nowhere else to go. The
Greens extracted their price with the deal on carbon
pricing. This trashed Gillard’s pre-election promise of a
more gradual consensus-based approach to the issue.

With the asylum seeker arrivals escalating, Gillard had
raised in the election run up the prospect of processing
in East Timor. It soon became clear this could not be
delivered.
A quick and dirty deal on the mining tax with major
companies immediately after she became PM gave
away a lot and led to a flawed tax that would raise little
revenue but contained inbuilt design faults.

The government’s imposition in early June 2011 of a
ban on live exports to Indonesia, after Four Corners
exposed cruelty to Australian cattle, would spark a
backlash from Indonesia and a crisis in the Australian
industry.

A year after grabbing the leadership, Gillard was in a
parlous position. Labor focus group research reportedly
had found her seen as “cold and untrustworthy, still
haunted by the way she took the job”.

Polling of 12 marginal seats in four states found only
one in three voters backed the carbon tax.

Rudd, who was foreign minister, was a hovering
Banquo’s ghost at anniversary time.

A Canberra Times editorial summed up Gillard’s failure
to make the transition from number 2 to number 1:

As deputy prime minister Ms Gillard was feted for her
political acumen, communication skills and ability to
make deals. As Prime Minister, the perception is that
she has floundered under pressure from an Opposition
that has remained in election campaign mode since
polling day … a failure to sell its messages has been
central to the government’s weaknesses.

A Nielsen poll just before the anniversary showed Labor
with worse results than a year before, and Rudd way
ahead of Gillard as preferred PM. It would be two years
before Labor would switch back to Rudd but the chatter
was underway.

Gillard could never get her feet properly under the desk
because Rudd’s shoes remained there.

2013: Tony Abbott

https://62e528761d0685343e1c-

m/files/59099/width668/5jjgb2v3-1410841059.jpg

Tony Abbott’s victory was much anticipated but the
course of his first year was not. It was full of the
surprises he had said would not be part of the way he’d
govern. It was also more inept than many expected.

Asked on anniversary day whether there were areas in
which he and his government could have done better,
Abbott said:

Page221of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.With the wisdom of 20/20 hindsight there are always
some things, but we’ve faced some difficult challenges
and I think we’ve handled them pretty well.

A few days earlier some desperate dealing had pushed
the repeal of the mining tax through federal parliament.
The government had been particularly anxious to
achieve this by the anniversary; abolishing the mining
tax had been one of its election mantras.

As had scrapping the carbon tax, to which the new
Senate had also agreed, while defying the government
on other aspects of Labor’s clean energy initiatives.

The government had stopped the boats, another core
election commitment. It had been assisted in this by the
second Rudd government’s harsh offshore detention
regime, but also by its own turn-back policy, on which it
stared down the Indonesians.

The government could say it had delivered on key
election commitments. But the promise to repair the
budget brought it enormous political grief, with many of
the savings measures highly unpopular with voters and
still facing defeat or emasculation in the Senate.

The government had trouble with its message, because
it had exaggerated the so-called budget emergency, and
had not paid adequate attention to the need for fairness
in its measures.

Minister Tony Abbott wheels his bike into his new office

Surprisingly, Abbott did not heed the lesson from his
own campaigning on Gillard’s broken promise, which
cost her so dearly. He flouted many of those he had
made: no new taxes, no cuts in a wide range of areas.
He rationalised this by finding ways to claim they weren’t
actually broken promises.

While opposition leaders are desperate to win elections,
it’s a fine judgement about how far they should
mortgage the future to maximise their chance of victory.
Abbott, a sure thing, did not have to give such blanket
undertakings of what he would not do. He paid dearly in
his first year for his purchase of that extra bit of
certainty.

On many fronts, the Coalition failed to adequately
prepare the community and itself for government. It
relied on slogans; promising to be an “adult”
government, it did not treat voters as grown-ups.

In its first year the government was highly ideological
and excessively tribal, including pursuing two former
prime ministers, Rudd and Gillard, though royal
commissions, something John Howard has expressed
doubts about.

But Abbott also displayed signs of pragmatism. The plan
to weaken the Racial Discrimination Act showed the
ideology; the abandonment of the plan in the face of
huge resistance from ethnic communities and likely
Senate defeat was an eye to the politics.

Page222of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.By the end of the year, the government was headed into
military conflict in the Middle East, treading a path
Howard had been down, though much later in his time in
office.

In style, the Abbott government was very centralised.
This led to complaints about the Abbott office being too
controlling and in particular about the dominance of his
powerful chief of staff Peta Credlin.

Poll analyst William Bowe has written that:

no government has ended its first year in a more
precarious electoral position certainly since Gough
Whitlam, and perhaps even since Jim Scullin brought
Labor to power just in time for the Great Depression to
strike in 1929.

Reflections on eight leaders over 40 years

Let me conclude with some observations in terms of the
criteria I mentioned earlier.

PROGRAM: If a PM arrives with a clear policy map,
which has been properly shared with the voters, the new
leader can claim a mandate (to the extent mandate
theory holds) and, importantly, use the first months to
good advantage. However that’s not a sure path to
smooth government, as Whitlam found.

Moreover as Hawke’s experience demonstrates, people
will accept policy being taken in an unanticipated
direction. But, to adapt a point that Howard has recently
made about selling reform, voters need to see that what
is done is in the national interest and is fair.

ARRIVING WITH POLITICAL CAPITAL: This ranges
from how the PM got the job to the size of the majority.
Again, it can be a complicated story. Contrast Keating
and Gillard, who each deposed a Labor PM. Gillard’s
capital was diminished by use of the sword; Keating’s
was enhanced. People understood the Keating-Hawke
changeover; they resented the Gillard-Rudd one. They
saw Keating coming; he won a formal vote; Hawke had
had a long reign. In contrast, Gillard had not been seen
as a challenger by the public, and Rudd’s demise was a
shock.

People understood the Hawke-Keating transition.

A strong majority is obviously helpful to a government,
but arguably the Senate is more important. Abbott has a
big majority but a difficult Senate and low personal
popularity. Even when there are no parliamentary blocks
to action, prime ministers can impose their own, as
Fraser’s admission of regret shows.

PERSONAL ORGANISATION AND OFFICE: These are
vitally important. The PM’s own habits set a rhythm for
the government and an example to colleagues; a good
office empowers the leader and guides team work.

Hawke was organised and had a strong personal staff
(dubbed the Manchu Court by Keating) with a balance

Page223of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.between political hard heads and experts like economist
Ross Garnaut. They weren’t afraid to push him or warn
him. At the other end of the spectrum Rudd had a
shambolic personal style, including an inability to move
paper, and an office unable to do anything about it, even
though in the first year it was headed by an experienced
operator in David Epstein.

TEAM PLAY: The Whitlam team had no experience of
government; the Abbott team has 15 ex-Howard
frontbenchers. With the transitions that took place in
government, the Keating and Gillard teams were
obviously experienced. But a new prime minister, faced
with a choice in individual cases between talent and
experience, would be wise to opt for the former, which
will pay better dividends in the long run.

The inaugural ministry is a special chance. Not that
there won’t be resentments if a new PM begins by
dropping people from his frontbench – as Abbott has
found with Ian Macdonald and Fraser discovered, with
seriously drastic consequences, when he dumped Don
Chipp who went on to found the Australian Democrats.

reform brought John Howard long-term political credit.
AAP/Mark Graham

HANDLING UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS: The
experiences of Howard and Rudd are instructive.
Howard’s gun reform brought him some short-term
political pain but lasting credit. The Rudd government’s
success in warding off recession when most countries
fell into it did not win much appreciation from voters. Did
they expect nothing less?

DELIVERING THE MESSAGE: Of these PMs Hawke
was the best communicator. Communicating in
opposition can be a separate skill from the task in
government: Whitlam and Abbott had been superb at
punching through messages as opposition leaders (one
positive, the other negative). But Whitlam could not rise
above his other problems in government and Abbott (so
far) hasn’t translated into an effective government
salesman. Modern spin machines also drain the human
face of leaders, as we’ve seen with both Gillard and
Abbott.

FIRST YEAR ASSESSMENTS: A look at the polls at the
end of the first year is interesting. In summary the
Whitlam, Fraser, Gillard and Abbott governments fell in
their first year; the Hawke, Keating, Howard and Rudd
governments rose. There is a matching pattern in prime
ministerial approval, with the exception of Fraser, whose
personal rating rose while that of his government
declined (from an extremely high level).

Whitlam and Labor dropped significantly. Labor polled
49.6% primary vote at the 1972 election; Whitlam’s
approval in the Morgan Gallup poll was 62% in February
1973. At the end of the first year, Labor was on 43%
primary vote, according to Morgan, and Whitlam’s
approval was 45%. Whitlam went on to win an election
in May 1974.

Page224of274©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Fraser won in 1975 with 53% of the primary vote. On
election day, Morgan polling has his approval at 38%.
By December 1976, the Coalition’s primary vote was
down to 47%, while Fraser’s approval was 42% (he
would go on to win with another whopping majority in
1977).

At the March 1983 election Labor had a primary vote of
49.5%; the Morgan poll showed Hawke’s approval at
54%. A year on Morgan had Labor at 55% and Hawke at
74% (but he lost seats in 1984).

Labor was rating at 38% primary vote in a Newspoll a
month after Keating took over; his approval was 21%.
By the end of his first year Labor had lifted to 47% but
he had only made 32%.

Howard had 47% of the primary vote at the election of
March 1996; a Newspoll in mid March had him on 45%
approval. A year on the Coalition had risen to 49% of the
primary vote, and Howard’s rating was 51%.

In later years the two party votes are available so we will
use that.

Rudd came in on 52.7% of the 2PP; in January 2008 his
approval rating was 59%. By his anniversary Labor was
polling at 55% 2PP and Rudd was at at 67% in
Newspoll. These figures highlight the drama of his later
fall and execution.

Although Labor was down in the polls when Gillard took
over, an immediate post coup poll had the ALP at 53%
2PP; Gillard’s approval the following month was 48%. A
year later the two party vote was down to 45% in
Newspoll and her approval 28%.

Abbott was elected on 53.5% of the 2PP, and he had a
Newspoll popularity rating of 47%. His anniversary
Newspoll was 48%, with 35% approval.

LEARNING AND GROWING: It should be easy to learn
and grow but politicians who reach the top of the
mountain usually have done so with a high degree of
self-belief. Growing requires being able to identify
mistakes and be willing to address weaknesses. For all
of them it is hard: they are not in the “I was wrong”
business; for some it is impossible.

One example makes the point. At the end of Rudd’s first
year, Hawke said he should delegate more. Others
suggested the pace should be less frenetic.

Rudd was defiant. “If it was possible to handle the
challenges we currently face with less urgency, I’d be up
for it – but it ain’t possible. It’s too big and too hard and
too broad. We’re advancing on multiple fronts, because
we have to deal with the immediate challenges of the
financial crisis … as well as prosecuting long-term
reform.”

He would never have been “up for” a slower pace but
refusing to be more measured undermined what he did.

The view from the top

The first year is the one where, usually, the view from
Everest is clear, or relatively so. Mostly the public is
willing to give the new PM a go, although by the year’s
end, reassessments can be underway.

Generally (though not invariably) the PM’s authority
starts high and those who would challenge it, including
an alternative leader, have not yet mustered their forces.
The elation of office is a more dominant feeling than the
grind of governing or the dread of defeat. At this early
stage, even when things are difficult, there still seems
time to deal with reversals that have come or that can be
seen in prospect.

The inaugural year might not be a prime minister’s best
one, but it will be very special: brimming with the delight
and the shock of the new, and the possibilities that still
stretch out to the horizon.
