ZBB Energy Corp. (ZBB) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange
Commission on August 18, 2014.

Recent Financial Results

TD

On August 18, 2014, the Company announced a proposed underwritten public offering of 9,600,000
shares of its common stock. The offering is subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance as
to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. The
shares will be issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement to be filed as part of a shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form S-3.

Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC is acting as sole managing underwriter for the proposed offering.

The prospectus supplement for the offering includes the following information concerning anticipated
financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.

We have not yet completed preparation of financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2014, but
based on preliminary data available to us, we expect to report:
total revenue ranging from $7.8 million to $7.9 million for such period, compared to $7.7 million for the
year ended June 30, 2013;
total operating expenses ranging from $16.4 million to $16.7 million for such period, compared to $19.3
million for the year ended June 30, 2013; and
net loss attributable to common shareholders ranging from $8.8 million to $9.2 million for such period,
compared to $11.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
We expect results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 to include an estimated charge
ranging from $1.5 million to $1.8 million due to a product upgrade initiative we established late in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Subsequent to commercialization, installation and commissioning of units in
the field we have garnered meaningful insights that have resulted in system design modifications and
other general upgrades that have improved performance, efficiency, and reliability. In the interest of
enhancing customer satisfaction, we launched an initiative to implement these improvements at certain
locations of our installed base over fiscal 2015.

We anticipate filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014 on or about
September 29, 2014. Our actual results for the year ended June 30, 2014 may differ materially from our
expectations. Additionally, during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year
ended June 30, 2014, we may identify items that would require us to make adjustments, which may be
material, to the estimates described above. This preliminary financial data has been prepared by and is
the responsibility of our management. Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP has not audited, reviewed,
compiled or performed any procedures with respect to this preliminary financial data, and accordingly,
Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. For a discussion of the risks that may cause our results of operations to differ from our
expectations, see "Risk Factors" elsewhere in the prospectus supplement.

On August 30, 2011, we entered into agreements providing for establishment of a joint venture to develop,
produce, sell, distribute and service advanced storage batteries and power electronics in China (the "Joint
Venture"). Joint Venture partners include ZBB PowerSav Holdings Limited, AnHui Xinlong Electrical Co.
and Wuhu Huarui Power Transmission & Transformation Engineering Co.
The Joint Venture was established in November 2011 and operates through a jointly owned company
located in Wuhu City, Anhui Province named Anhui Meineng Store Energy Co., Ltd. ("Meineng Energy").
Meineng Energy was initially capitalized with approximately $13.6 million of equity capital, which
included approximately $9.5 million of cash and a contribution of technology from us to Meineng Energy
via a license agreement valued at approximately $4.1 million by Meineng Energy.
On August 12, 2014 Meineng Energy received a cash investment of 20,000,000 RMB (approximately $3.2
million) from Wuhu Fuhai-Haoyan Venture Investment, L.P., a branch of Shenzhen Oriental Fortune
Capital Co., Ltd., for a post-closing equity position of 8%. Subject to receipt of required governmental
approval for this investment, which is expected to be received in August or September, 2014, this
investment capital will be used to fund ongoing operations and development of the China market, and
provides Meineng Energy a 250,000,000 RMB (approximately $42 million) post-closing valuation.
Following this investment our indirect interest in Meineng Energy equals approximately 30%.
