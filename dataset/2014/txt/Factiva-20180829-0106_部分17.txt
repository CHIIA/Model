Social entertainment firm mig33, which is in the middle of a reverse takeover of Latin Gold, has
secured more than $10 million in investment from Hong Kong-listed handset manufacturer FIH
Mobile.
ASX-listed Latin Gold said mig33 had secured an initial US$2.2 million in funding from FIH after it
purchased existing and new shares in migg33's holding companyProject Goth Inc.

Latin Gold said FIH would invest a further US$7.4 million in mig33 by purchasing 40 million Latin
Gold shares at 20 cents per share upon completion of the reverse takeover transaction.
FIH's investment in mig33 will take its interest in the social entertainment company to 19.9 per cent.
FIH is listed in Hong Kong and has a market capitalisation of about US$4 billion. Hon Hai Precision
Industry Company, which has a 67 per cent stake in FIH, has annual revenue of about US$132
billion and a market capitalisation of about US$33.7 billion.
Latin Gold said the introduction of FIH as a significant shareholder would provide the company with
the opportunity to substantially accelerate its growth plans.

"This includes the planned establishment of a development centre in Taiwan, where Hon Hai is
based, which will be focused on business development and extending the company's reach into the
mobile telephony network," Latin Gold said.

mig33 was developed and launched in Perth in 2006 by Steven Goh.
Latin Gold and mig33 announced plans in January for the latter to complete a reverse takeover of
the former. On completion of the deal mig33 shareholders will hold a 69.5 per cent stake in the gold
explorer.
