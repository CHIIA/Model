BHP Considers Asset Spinoff

That Could Total $8 Billion
BHP Billiton said it favored a spinoff of unwanted assets into a new company, which analysts said
could be valued at more than $8 billion.
BHP, the world's largest mining company by market value, didn't specify on Friday which assets it
might separate as it looks to concentrate on producing iron ore, copper, coal and petroleum, which
account for the bulk of its earnings.
Analysts expect the company would include nickel and aluminum operations that BHP acquired in its
transformational takeover of the U.K.'s Billiton PLC in 2001.

A spinoff won't be easy. BHP's dual listing in London and Sydney complicates how management would
distribute any shares in a newly created company. One option for BHP would be to spin the new
company off to shareholders in its Australian entity, compensating investors in its U.K. listing with a
share buyback.

China's Lenovo Group Ltd. has passed the U.S. government panel that screens deals with possible
national-security implications. IBM said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has
concluded its review regarding the company's sale of x86-based server business. In a separate
statement, Lenovo said the deal has completed the regulatory process in the U.S. and is on track to
close by the end of the year.
