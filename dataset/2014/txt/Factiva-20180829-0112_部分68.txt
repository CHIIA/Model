A major domino in the mining industry's year of transactions has fallen, with the long-awaited sale of
GlencoreXstrata's $US5.85 billion Las Bambas project expected to trigger several other deals in
Australia and around the world. Melbourne-based, Chinese- owned miner MMG led a consortium of
Chinese entities that reached an agreement to buy the prized Peruvian copper mine from its Swiss
owners on Monday. MMG's Australian chief executive Andrew Michelmore described the purchase as
"transformative" for his Hong Kong-listed company, and it could prove transformative for several other
companies too. The sale was required by Chinese authorities before they would give their blessings to a
merger of Glencore and Xstrata, having previously expressed concerns about the power the merged
entity would wield over copper markets. ASX-listed PanAust was also an interested spectator to
Monday's events, having needed the sale of Las Bambas to occur before it could proceed with its
preliminary deal to buy one of GlencoreXstrata's other assets: an 80 per cent stake in Papua New
Guinea's Frieda River copper project. Clarity over the Las Bambas sale - which still requires approval
from MMG shareholders and regulators in Peru and China - could also precipitate long-awaited asset
divestments for Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, given GlencoreXstrata is considered a suitor for the assets
that could be discarded by both miners. GlencoreXstrata boss Ivan

Glencore's mine sale could kick off more transactions.

Glasenberg has indicated interest in Rio Tinto's Australian coal assets and BHP's nickel assets in WA.
MMG will own 62.5 per cent of the joint venture that will buy Las Bambas, with Chinese investment firm
Guoxin International taking 22.5per cent and CITIC owning 15per cent. The transaction will see the joint
venture buy 100 per cent of the corporate entity through which GlencoreXstrata owns Las Bambas, using
a share purchase agreement. The deal will involve equity and debt, and was made possible by a
banking syndicate organised by China Development Bank. Mr Michelmore would not reveal the cost of
debt on the deal, but promised to reveal more about the

funding package and MMG's plans for developing the asset in May. Construction of Las Bambas is 56per
cent complete and GlencoreXstrata had expected it to be finished in 2015, but Mr Michelmore said that
after its own investigations,

MMG may believe a different schedule is required. "The addition of Las Bambas to MMG's international
portfolio delivers on our growth strategy and vision to build a global diversified minerals and metals
company," he said.

MMG operates the Rosebery base metals mine in Tasmania as well as Queensland's Century zinc mine,
which will close in 2015. MMG recently deferred plans to build a new zinc and silver mine at Dugald River

of Las Bambas. Las Bambas will produce more than 2 million tonnes of copper concentrate in its first
five years of operation and will be one of the world's three biggest copper producers by 2017.

Baillieu Holst analyst Adrian Prendergast said clarity over Las Bambas would "clear the long-term growth
prospects for PanAust", which he said was likely to favour development of Frieda River over another
option in Chile.
