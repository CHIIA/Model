BEIJING, October 17, SinoCast -- About 50 dairy farmers in west Victoria, Australia were said to have
signed agreements to sell their farms to a China-controlled dairy group at AUD 400 million in total.
The 50 farms have a total of 90,000 cows and annual milk output of 500 million liters, equivalent to about
one twentieth of Victoria's total milk supply.

The group aims to improve the dairy output of newly-merged farms by at least 50% to supply milk to two
newly-built processing factories in west Victoria, which will process and export AUD 700 million worth of
high-quality infant formula milk powder to China and other international markets.
