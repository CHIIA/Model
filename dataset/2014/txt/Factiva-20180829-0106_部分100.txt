from $55.90 to $60.30 ahead of Macquarie's full year profit result due out on May 2.

guidance of up 40/45% and a full year dividend of 1. 170c implying a full year payout ratio of 73%.

The broker said over the past six years the immediate reaction of MQG's share price to the full year result
has been driven by the outlook commentary. It expects this trend to continue.

slow given Delaware's skew towards fixed income and whether an announcement on CEO succession
will be made this year.

Page241of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.price reduced its EBITDA by 2%. "Importantly we continue to see value in AGO with our $120/share NPV
carrying no value for McPhee Creek. Atlas is nearing completion of the McPhee Creek mine and rail
pre-feasibility which is expected to be finalised in the June quarter. Moreover, Atlas continues to progress
minor feasibility studies on its South-East Pilbara projects, which is being done in tandem with
discussions for third party rail haulage", the broker said in its report.
*A leading broker retained a "neutral" on Atlas Iron after its quarterly report which it said was mixed -
while shipments were stronger than the broker expected, achieved pricing pre adjustments was weaker
quarter on quarter and against its expectations. The broker maintained its preference for FMG within the
pure play iron ore universe. The broker retained a $1.20 price target.

*Another leading broker reiterated a "reduce" recommendation while increasing the target price from 75c
to 77c. The broker said production was positive but at a higher discount. Although the business delivered
pleasing shipment volumes over the quarter, the broker said in the report, weakness in the received price
($US100.08/dmt) has negatively affected its near term outlook for earnings and cash flows, but had
limited impact on full year 2015 NPAT and beyond.

AGO down 3.8c to 93.7c.
