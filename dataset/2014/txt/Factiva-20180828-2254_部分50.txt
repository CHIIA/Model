CENTREX Metals has set a final deadline of February 15 for Chinese Government-owned Wugang
Australian Resources Investment to invest in its proposed Port Spencer project.
Both partners signed up to the project in early 2012, but a change of government in China has slowed
down mining investment in Australia, Centrex chief executive Ben Hammond said.

The Port Spencer project is being re-evaluated as a small-scale trans-shipment operation with a low
start-up cost of about $142 million, but Wugang has to invest the next $4 million to win a 50 per cent
stake in the project.

“We haven’t had a date set for a while but we want to see a resolution to the matter,” Mr Hammond
said.

The agreements will terminate if the remaining conditions are not met. The port has been granted
conditional approval by the State Government and Centrex is undertaking a further review to bring
down costs.The port is key to Centrex developing its iron ore projects on the Eyre Peninsula, but the
progress and scale have been reviewed in the current environment of falling iron ore prices.
