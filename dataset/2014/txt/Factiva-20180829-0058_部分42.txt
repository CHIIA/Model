MELBOURNE, Australia--ISentia Group Ltd., an Australian media-monitoring service, plans to raise
283.5 million Australian dollars (US$264.2 million) ahead of a June listing on the Australian Securities
Exchange.
The company, which began as a small family business almost 32 years ago and until recently was
known as Media Monitors, plans to offer 139 million shares to new institutional and retail shareholders
at A$2.04 each, it said in a prospectus filed Tuesday.
ISentia's majority shareholders, funds associated with Quadrant Private Equity, will retain 50 million
shares in the company following the initial public offering.

The IPO will help iSentia consolidate its market positions and continue its growth in Australia and New
Zealand and countries in Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and China, the company
said.

"We are seeing strong growth in our business," said John Croll, iSentia's chief executive.
The company monitors and interprets data from 5,500 mainstream media organizations, more than
55,000 online news sources, plus user-generated content on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to
alert its clients about what is being said about their business and industry, iSentia said.
Macquarie Capital and UBS AG have been appointed as joint lead managers, joint bookrunners and
underwriters of the IPO. ISentia is set to begin trading on the ASX on June 5.
