CHINESE buyers are breaking rules governing the purchase of Australian homes, the head of the
Real Estate Institute of Victoria has revealed.

Enzo Raimondo, CEO of the REIV, said foreign buyers were purchasing existing houses,
demolishing them and rebuilding new, bigger homes in Balwyn, Glen Waverley and other eastern
suburbs.

This is against Foreign Investment Review Board rules that state foreign buyers may not purchase
existing homes.
They can only buy and demolish existing houses if they subdivide the block and build two
dwellings. Or they may knock over houses that are “derelict and uninhabitable”.

But Mr Raimondo said: “There’s certainly heritage-featured homes that are quite habitable that are
being bulldozed for huge French provincials selling for multi, multi-millions, three million.

“It may well be that some of that doesn’t comply with the FIRB rules. “It’s been going on for some
time now.’’ He said it was “obvious the majority of buyers in a certain area (are) doing this”.

Kelly O’Dwyer, member for Higgins, which takes in Glen Iris, Ashburton and Carnegie, said “there
might be occasions where people might totally disregard the rules”.

She is chairing a federal parliamentary committee reviewing foreign investment rules governing
residential real estate.

Ms O’Dwyer said the review would investigate whether there were “distortions” in the market due to
the operation of the rules.“Is it increasing dwellings for Australians or are existing properties being
purchased, making it more difficult to buy homes?” she said.
