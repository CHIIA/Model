BillionaireHarry Triguboff, born in a White Russian Jewish enclave in China, has spent 50 years
building Australia's biggest unit company, Meriton Apartments.
But now, aged 81, Australia's fourth-richest person is considering selling half of Meriton to Chinese
interests in a deal that could net him at least $3 billion. It would be the ultimate sale of Australian
apartments to Chinese investors.

Triguboff told AFR Weekend he received an offer for his business on a trip to China two weeks ago from
the owner of a property developer that builds 200,000 dwellings there annually.

"I am thinking I could sell part of [Meriton]," Triguboff said.

"It is very early stages, but I could be prepared to sell the development part of the business and then the
family could continue to collect the rent on the units I already own. Maybe I could retire soon and they
could run the investment business."
He says the company, which carries little debt, is now worth about $6.3 billion after his wealth was
valued at $4.95 billion on the 2013 BRW Rich List.
Meriton, Triguboff says, will make about $300 million profit from unit sales of about $1.1 billion this year
and the company's land bank for future developments has "easily" gone up $200 million in value in the
past 12 months.
The potential sale to the Chinese developer, who Triguboff would not name, would comprise of the
existing developments that are under way.
The rental business makes about $200 million profit each year, Triguboff said, from the 2000 units he
owns in Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. That business would stay in family hands and is worth up
to $3.5 billion.

Triguboff has mostly built in Sydney and said house prices there have "stabilised" and that better growth
was being experienced in Brisbane, albeit off a relatively low base. CONDITION ON SALE

Any move to sell would be a marked shift in strategy for Triguboff, who has famously said for decades he
had little interest in ever retiring. He said his daughters had never shown real interest in taking over
Meriton but that he now has a grandson, Daniel, working for him who could potentially head the
investment business the family would continue to own.
However, Triguboff cautioned that any sale would only take place if the Meriton sales business remains
intact.

"I am not selling anything if they are going to start firing people," he said.

bad deal, I am looking at the evolution of the company. He [the potential buyer] wants apartments that
are able to be sold. Of course there are many Chinese buying in Australia at the moment and what we
have is a lot of apartments that already have a lot of approvals. That is why they are interested in me."
Triguboff said Australia would be "silly to be afraid of the Chinese" in terms of investment, but warned
foreign property developers could lose interest in investing in Australia if project approvals continued to
unfold at a slow place.

"They do want to be in Australia because it is safe for them, but they can go anywhere they like if they do
not make the money here they want. The planning is still too slow here."
