WA agribusinesses have much on their plate as they react to unprecedented interest from overseas
investors.

Industry experts said in many cases the interest was unsolicited and covered everything from capital
injections, to joint ventures and outright purchases.

The approaches have local businesses unaccustomed to the attention scrambling to hire accounting
firms and advisers to assess the merits of the offers and the people making them.

“Businesses are tooling up to assess whether people are serious because they are being
approached by overseas companies and investors they have never heard of wanting to look at the
books,” one consultant said.

“They are not used to the idea of data rooms and opening the books so they’re getting in
professional help.”
Most of the interest has come from Asia and centred on dairy and meat processors with export
licences.
Harvey Fresh, Wellard, Craig Mostyn Group and Harvey Beef are some of the high-profile
businesses known to have investors knocking regardless of whether there is a for sale or investors
wanted sign on the door.
Meat processors with export capacity, including Yeeda Pastoral Company, V&V Walsh, Western
Meat Packers and Fletcher International Exports, are all considered tempting targets.

Azure Capital director Adrian Arundell said there was a disconnect between the scale of operations
potential overseas investors were seeking and the opportunities available in WA.

“We are seeing increasing interest coming down from Asia particularly with a focus on protein and
people consistently looking at dairy, but outside of those sectors and the key businesses it is harder
to find agricultural assets of major significance,” he said.

“If you look down through the profile of businesses, the higher they are in terms of domestic
consumption — or the smaller their export profile — the less interest there is for players coming out
of Asia.”

Mr Arundell said most of the interest was coming through investment banks and funds operating
through Singapore and Hong Kong looking to supply consumers in China.
Melbourne-based consultant David Williams, who acted for Bega Cheese in the battle for
Warrnambool Cheese and Butter, said dealing with Chinese investors was often a drawn-out
process.

were unaware of the opportunities to invest in successful smaller-scale food producers.

“They just don’t see the smaller, what I’d call sweet, prizes that are around,” he said.

Mr Williams noted Japanese investors had returned to the agribusiness sector.
“The main interest in distressed food assets is coming out of China, but the Japanese are active
again — we haven’t seen much of them for the past 10 years but they are back with a force in food,”
he said.
Japanese giant Mitsubishi grabbed a 25 per cent stake in Tasmanian Dairy Products in 2012.
Hong Kong-based William Hui has just purchased United Dairy Power, which operates in South
Australia and Victoria, for about $70 million.
Craig Mostyn Group chief executive David Lock said outside of the dairy sector there was a lot of
“tyre kicking”.

“Certainty there is an increasing appetite for export-oriented businesses,” he said.

“The interest in businesses producing pork and poultry for the domestic market is less a lot less than
in dairy.”

There are about 1200 food manufacturing businesses in WA, ranging from small family operations to
corporate entities.

The food manufacturing sector employs about 18,000 people.
