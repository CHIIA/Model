*Reuters reports China will further tighten supervision over the shadow banking sector, the country's
banking regulator said on Friday, part of an ongoing campaign to control off-balance sheet lending by the
country's financial institutions.
However at the same time, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) will continue to support
buyers of affordable housing, first-time home buyers and small- and medium- sized businesses amid
signs of a slowing economy. "Currently, the economy, broadly speaking, is stable. But downward
pressures are relatively significant which is a reflection of ... imperfect financing structures, inefficiencies
in finance allocation and use and difficulties with SME (small and medium enterprises) financing," a press
release circulated at the CBRC's conference said. Wang Zhaoxing, a vice president at the China Banking
Regulatory Commission, told a news conference that the regulator will improve ways to manage
deposit-to-loan ratios, an indicator of a bank's ability to absorb risk, and classify bad loans.
