RESOURCES

THE number of major resource projects receiving the green light has tumbled to the lowest level in
more than a decade.

And spending on new projects by mining and energy companies will shrink further as falling
commodity prices destroy their business cases, Australia’s official commodities forecaster says.
The warning from the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics comes after the price of iron
ore — the nation’s single biggest export item — crashed through $US70 a tonne yesterday for the
first time in five years.
Only three resource projects worth $597 million, all backed by Fortescue Metals, received a final
investment decision in the six months to October, the figures reveal.
This compares with eight projects worth $12.8 billion in the previous six months.

The project pipeline will shrink further as major gas projects are completed. Victoria only has one
project at the committed stage — the $1 billion gas conditioning plant being built at Longford, near
Sale, by ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton.
There were seven projects worth $1.6 billion at the feasibility stage at the end of October, down
from eight worth $1.8 billion six months earlier.

At a national level, there were eight fewer projects considered feasible at the end of October as
companies shelved investment plans amid falling commodity prices.

“Declining commodity prices have continued to weigh on investment decisions with many
developers revisiting project feasibility studies amid weaker than expected prices,” said Wayne
Calder, the bureau’s deputy executive director.
The update came as the price of iron ore fell to $US69.58 yesterday — falling below $US70 for the
first time since June 2009.

It has almost halved since the start of the year.

The price has come under pressure as major miners such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Brazil’s
Vale bring on new supply, and amid mounting concerns over the health of the Chinese property
market.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the seaborne iron ore market needs to absorb a
surplus of about 110 million tonnes next year, almost double the 60 million-tonne oversupply
recorded this year.
