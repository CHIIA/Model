A cross-border team from global legal practice Norton Rose Fulbright has advised China's largest
privately owned corporation, Fosun International Limited (Fosun), on the $489 million takeover of ASX
listed ROC Oil Company Limited (ROC).
The deal, announced on 4 August 2014, involved lawyers from our Melbourne, Shanghai, Perth, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Jakarta and London offices.

ROC is an oil company with assets across China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Australia and the UK. Fosun's
takeover bid for ROC has trumped a competing merger bid with another ASX-listed oil and gas
company, Horizon Energy. The merger was scheduled to be voted on by Horizon shareholders on
August 7 and was due to be completed on August 14.
Melbourne-based mergers and acquisitions and equity capital markets partner James Stewart said
"working with Fosun on their first significant investment in an Australian company has allowed us to
demonstrate our unique capabilities working with Chinese clients to deliver a seamless cross border
service across six jurisdictions".

The cross-border team advising Fosun on the deal was led by Mr Stewart, and also included Sun Hong
(Shanghai), Andrew Fisken (Melbourne), Tony Zhong (Shanghai), Kirsten Gourd (Melbourne), Roger
Hawkins (Melbourne), Fei Kwok (Shanghai), Jeremy Wickens (Perth), Simon Meagher (Perth), Jon Perry
(Hong Kong), Nicholas Wilson (Hong Kong), Esther Yee (Hong Kong), Bintang Hidayanto (Jakarta),
Ashley Wright (Singapore), Geoff Peters (London) and Aidar Darmesh (London).
