Takeover
Parmalat Australia chief executive Craig Garvin said the French-owned dairy company would keep
hunting for quality acquisitions, just hours after penning a $120 million deal to acquire Western
Australia's biggest dairy exporter, Harvey Fresh.

Harvey Fresh processes 130 million litres of milk a year - roughly a third of WA's milk - and produces
100 million litres of fruit juice at its facilities in Harvey, WA, and Griffith, NSW. Mr Garvin said none of
Harvey's 300-odd employees would lose their jobs.
"Our intention is to grow this business. This gives us a market we didn't have a strong presence in, a
manufacturing footprint and access to milk supply in WA," Mr Garvin told Fairfax Media.
The deal comes amid a wave of consolidation and corporate manoeuvring in Australia's dairy sector
and surging appetite for dairy products in Asia.
In February, Canadian dairy powerhouse Saputo won a fierce $500 million takeover battle for
Australia's oldest dairy, Warrnambool Cheese & Butter, and Hong Kong businessman William Hui
snapped up Australia's biggest privately owned dairy processor, United Dairy Power, for $70 million.

"The industry is consolidating. If the value is right, we will look at it [a takeover]. We are very happy with
the acquisition," Mr Garvin said.
Soaring global demand for milk powders and infant formulas has pushed prices for some dairy
products to near record highs and has put a rocket under farm-gate milk prices. But domestic-focused
processors are under intense pressure as margins are sandwiched by the spiralling cost of milk and
depressed prices on the retail shelf due to the supermarket wars between Coles and Woolworths.
Parmalat exports less than 10 per cent of the 850 million litres of milk it collects every year, and Mr
Garvin said growing exports was a core part of his strategy. But he insisted he was not abandoning the
domestic market because of the supermarkets' cut-price milk battle.
"We are keen to invest in Australian dairy with a strong export focus, but we are not walking away from
the domestic market," he said. "We have to work as constructively with Woolies and Coles as we can."
