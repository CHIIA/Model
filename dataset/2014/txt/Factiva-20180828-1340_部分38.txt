Sydney, Australia, July 14, 2014 - (ABN Newswire) - The China CleanTech Index provides the definitive
measure of the performance of Chinese cleantech companies that are listed on stock exchanges around
the world.

The cleantech industry is split into a number of sub-sectors as detailed in the table below. Each of the
sub-sectors contains companies that have both environmental and economic benefits.

TD

Biogas

Geothermal - Hot dry rocks and conventional

Biofuels

Low Emissions Transport Technologies

Carbon Trading
Solar Thermal and Photovoltaics
Energy Efficiency & Biomaterials

Waste Management & Recycling
Energy Storage & Fuel Cells

Water

Environmental Services

Wave, Tidal & Hydro

Green Buildings
Wind Generation

The cleantech sector is fundamentally different to Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) or
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance. SRI and ESG look at incremental
improvements in company performance and can be seen as 'operational hygiene' measures that find the
best in class. Cleantech focuses on companies whose output positively enhances the communities and
ecologies in which they reside. It is about doing 'more good' rather than 'less bad'.

With over 160 companies falling under the coverage of the Index and with a combined market
capitalisation of over 1 trillion Renminbi (US$165 billion), the China CleanTech Index presents for the first
time a picture of the Chinese cleantech industry's growth in a single measure.

The Index is weighted by market capitalisation and is benchmarked against the following indices to show
its relative performance:

Page102of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.- Wilder Hill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX) - which measures the performance of global
clean energy stocks

- Cleantech Index (CTIUS) - which measures the performance of global cleantech stocks
- China Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) - which measures the performance of stocks listed in
Shanghai.

- MSCI World (MSCI) - which provides a measure of the performance of global stock markets.

The rules for the formulation and management of the Index have been developed with reference to global
best practice. An overview of these rules is provided in the annual performance report.
The China Cleantech Index is updated each month and published on the SinoCleantech website at
www.sinocleantech.com and on the Australian CleanTech website at:

http://www.auscleantech.com.au

It is published internationally in conjunction with Cleantech Investor:

and in China in conjunction with Top Capital:

Index Rebalance

Page105of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The China CleanTech Index underwent its quarterly rebalancing at the end of June which took account of
recent share issues and other corporate activity. One company was removed from the index and no
additional companies were added during this rebalance.
The company removed from the Index was Tri-Tech Holding, Inc which is currently in the process of
delisting from the NASDAQ.

Component Sub-Indices
To provide an analysis of the China CleanTech Index, eight sub-indices have been developed. The
performance of each of these sub-indices over the last five years and the current quarter are shown in the
table and charts below.

Only two of the eight sub-indices recorded gains for the quarter. The best results were the 4.4% gain for
the China Hydro Index and the 4.2% gain for the China Solar Index. The worst results were recorded by
the 11.2% loss from the China Waste Index and 7.9% loss from the China Efficiency Index.
Over the first six months of 2014, the best results were the 16.5% gain for the China Solar Index and the
5.5% gain for the China Efficiency Index. The worst results were recorded by the 18.9% loss from the
China Waste Index and 11.3% loss from the China Environment Index.
