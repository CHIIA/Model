The property investment arm of Hong Kong conglomerate Glorious Sun has made its first foray into
Melbourne's CBD, paying $25.3 million for a Chinatown-fringe office building.

Glorious Sun, which owns the Jeanswest, Quiksilver and Roxy clothing brands, bought the 12-storey
building at 231-235 Swanston Street on a tight 3.5 per cent yield.

CBRE agent Josh Rutman, who negotiated the deal with Mark Wizel and Ed Wright, said Glorious Sun
was planning to hold the building as a passive investment.

The move signals a slight shift from the usual interest in development sites shown by Asian investors.

CBRE head of research Stephen McNabb said it was all part of a trend towards greater investment in
the Australian market from Asia, and China in particular.

"What we are seeing is a change in the mix. Historically, foreign investors have been from Europe and
the US but what we have seen in the past 18 months is a significant increase in capital coming out of
China. It more than doubled last year and it's running at the same pace this year," Mr McNabb said.
CBRE research shows that Australian property attracted 12 per cent of Asian capital in 2003 and will
be the target of an extra $US75 billion ($78.5 billion) in coming years as Asian life insurers, led by
China and Taiwan, look for assets.
Australia accounted for 5 per cent of global investment in property in 2013 with investors drawn by
stable economic conditions and higher yields and interest rates than other regions.

Glorious Sun made its first investment in Melbourne in mid-2009 when it bought the Australian Tax
Office building in Box Hill from ING Office Fund for $43.8 million.
Its most recent purchase was the most significant sale in the retail core since the $17 million
purchase of the Bradman building on the corner of the Bourke Street Mall and Swanston Street in
2010 on a 4.78 per cent yield.

"We were blown away by the local market's pricing of the asset which set a very strong benchmark,"
Mr Rutman said. The vendors, who are engaged in legal action, were selling under instructions from
the Supreme Court and were represented by law firm Maddocks.
