Local shares had the biggest daily fall in three weeks as data showed the services sectors in Australia
and China softened in December.

On Monday, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 25.2 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5324.9, after
taking a mixed lead from the United States on Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished
higher while the S&P 500 closed lower.

The HSBC China services business activity index posted 50.9 in December, down from 52.5 in
November. It was the weakest result in 28 months. However, the HSBC China composite PMI data for
December, which covers both manufacturing and services, rose for the fifth successive month.

Major markets around Asia were weaker on Monday afternoon.

Locally, the Australian Industry Group Australian Performance of Services Index slipped 2.8 points to
46.1 in December, indicating the sector is contracting. The index had previously risen for three
consecutive months since September, the month of the federal election, reaching a high of 48.9 points
in November.

Despite Monday's losses Credit Suisse is forecasting high single-digit gains for the ASX 200 this year.
"We are forecasting the local benchmark index to deliver total returns of 9 per cent in 2014 despite a
flat outlook for company profits," Credit Suisseequity strategist Hasan Tevfik said. "The
macroeconomic and company earnings outlooks for Australia are poor and the consensus among
global equity strategists is to be underweight Australian shares.

"But local money will keep pouring into shares because domestic investors like the dividends and, with
the returns on cash and bonds so low, they don't have much other choice."

At the local close on Monday, the dollar was buying US89.48¢, down from US89.86¢ at Friday's close.

Credit Suisse has a stock-picking strategy for 2014 to pick companies that have a clear plan to
increase cash flow without depending on a lower dollar or improving domestic economy.

"Only lazy managers moan about the strength of the currency. We are cautious on companies that
have an assumption about a lower dollar as key to their strategy," Mr Tevfik said.Energy stocks fall on
weak oil price outlook
Energy was the worst-performing sector, down 0.9 per cent as oil commodity prices edged higher
over the weekend after suffering their biggest weekly fall in 19 months. On Monday the Brent crude oil
price was 0.1 per cent higher at $US107.04 a barrel, however most analysts are tipping oil prices to
decline in 2014.
Australia's biggest oil producer, Woodside Petroleum, dropped 1.1 per cent to $37.70, while Caltex
Australia also lost 1.1 per cent to $19.48. Karoon Gas dropped 5.1 per cent at $4.13. Progress on the

Christine. Buru Energy bucked the trend, up 2.5 per cent at $1.82. In late December the junior
explorer provided a positive update on its Ungani project.
"One area where we are already seeing free cash-flow generation is among the big iron ore miners
that have been lowering costs and reducing debt," Mr Tevfik said. On Monday, the big iron ore miners
were all lower despite the spot price, landed in China, holding up at $US135 a tonne.

BHP Billiton dipped 0.6 per cent to $37.56, while Rio Tinto fell 0.9 per cent to $67.75 and Fortescue
Metals Group dropped 1.9 per cent to $5.71.CBA leads the banks
The spot price of gold rose for the third session in a row to $US1239.33 an ounce. Junior goldminer
Northern Star Resources was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 6 per cent to 89¢. In
late December the explorer acquired the Plutonic project from Barrick Gold Corp for $25 million.
However Australia's biggest goldminer, Newcrest Mining, fell 0.6 per cent to $8.62; junior gold
explorer Independence Group was the worst-performing stock, falling 5.4 per cent at 18¢. Mining
engineering services company Cardno dropped 2.3 per cent to $6.69 after announcing chief Andrew
Buckley will retire in March.

The big four banks were mostly lower on Monday. ANZ Banking Group and Westpac each dropped
0.7 per cent to $31.99 and $32.12 respectively, while National Australia Bank fell 0.4 per cent to
$34.55. Commonwealth Bank edged up 2¢ to $77.60.

Telecommunications was the best-performing sector, closing flat as Telstra Corporation was steady at
$5.27.

Commonwealth Property Office Fund was unchanged at $1.25 as a joint takeover offer from the
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and DEXUS Group officially opened. Shares in DEXUS
Group lost 2 per cent to $1.

Continuing dry conditions in northern Australia are putting pressure on the outlook for food producers.
On Monday, GrainCorp shed 0.8 per cent at $8.51, while Australian Agricultural Co lost 1.2 per cent at
$1.22.
