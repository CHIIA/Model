SYDNEY--China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) has abandoned plans for a buyout of Yancoal
Australia Ltd. (YAL.AU), the Australian-listed coal producer said Monday.

"Yanzhou today notified Yancoal that [it] no longer wishes to pursue with its indicative non‐binding
proposal regarding the possible privatization of Yancoal Australia," Yancoal said in a statement to the
Australian Securities Exchange, without elaborating further.

The planned deal was announced last July and would have seen Yanzhou buy out minority investors
in the unit--in which it holds a 78% stake--and delist the stock.
Hong Kong-listed Yanzhou, one of China's largest coal mining companies, said at the time that it
could better manage the impact of weak coal prices if it had full control of the Australian unit.

Last December, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey relaxed ownership restrictions on Yanzhou, which
had committed in 2009 to sell down its holding so it could secure government approval for a 3.5 billion
Australian dollar (US$3.2 billion) takeover of Felix Resources Ltd. The restrictions would have forced
Yanzhou to reduce its stake below 70% by the end of last year.
