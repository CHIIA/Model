SYDNEY, Sept 1 (Reuters) - London copper edged down on Monday, after ending August with its
biggest monthly drop since March on signs of fragility in the global economy, as markets awaited the
release of a key manufacturing gauge in top metals user China.

FUNDAMENTALS

* Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange edged down 0.2 percent to $6,966 a tonne by
0044 GMT after posting a small gain in the previous session.
* London copper finished August with losses of 1.9 percent for its first monthly loss in four months.

* LME aluminium eased 0.2 percent to $2,092 a tonne after hitting its highest since Feb 2013 at
$2,119.50 on Friday. Aluminium was the top performer among LME metals in August, climbing 5.5
percent on tight immediate supply.
* The most-traded October copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 0.5 percent to
50,000 yuan ($8,139) a tonne in overnight trade.

* Euro zone inflation fell to a fresh five-year low in August, data showed on Friday, something likely to
concern the European Central Bank but not force it into immediate policy action.

* U.S. consumer spending fell in July for the first time in six months, but confidence among households
hit a seven-year high in August, suggesting the retrenchment would be temporary.
* Activity in China's vast factory sector likely weakened in August as demand faltered, a Reuters poll
showed on Thursday, reinforcing expectations that further policy steps may be needed to keep
economic growth on track.
* Mexican authorities on Friday searched the offices of Buenavista copper mine, which belongs to
miner Grupo Mexico, as part of an investigation into a toxic spill that could cost the firm billions of
pesos, the prosecutor's office said.

would ease monetary policy next week faded.
