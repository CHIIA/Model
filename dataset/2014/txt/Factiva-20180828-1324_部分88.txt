Hong Kong-based satellite business SpeedCast has raised $150 million at $1.96 a share and will
list on the Australian Securities Exchange in the middle of August, as revealed by Financial Review
Sunday.

UBS has underwritten the initial public offering after receiving strong indications from overseas and
local institutional investors. The deal was priced at 17 times forecast 2015 profit on Friday night.

SpeedCast is expected to list with a $236 million market capitalisation, while private equity owner
TA Associates, which snapped up the company less than two years ago, has retained a 25 per
cent stake.

In May, the satellite service provider lured in iiNet founder Michael Malone as a board director to sit
alongside TransACT chairman John Mackay. Malone's appointment followed the purchase of local
rival SatComms Australia.

Malone bought stock in the IPO, as did the other non-executive directors. SpeedCast's chief
executive and co-founder, Pierre-Jean Beylier, has one of the largest shareholdings.
UBS had been touting a valuation of 17 to 20 times 2015 profit. CIMB was drafted in as co-lead
manager, while Morgans has been drumming up interest from retail investors.
Elsewhere, Quadrant Private Equity has appointed Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley to work
alongside UBS on its $1 billion-odd IPO of Estia Health. UBS advised on Estia's recent
acquisitions, including the $200 million Cook Care Group in June.
