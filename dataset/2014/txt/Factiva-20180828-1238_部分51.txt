ASIA'S appetite for Australian dairy is showing no signs of being satisfied as Bega Cheese outlines
plans to up exports to the orient.
Asian demand for Bega's dairy products already accounts for 28 per cent of sales, which the
company says will be a platform for future expansion.

Domestic customers made up 65 per cent of sales revenue.
As part of its marketing, the company initiated a "chef-led-selling program" in China and South East
Asia which helps teach local pastry chefs how to bake with cream cheese.
Bega chief executive Aidan Coleman said despite Australian wholesale milk prices being driven up
due to competition, the Asian market remains ripe for the long term.
"There does remain a strong underlying demand for dairy products in Asia," Mr Coleman said.
"There is a very good base for expansion."
Bega said it will spend $25 million to increase its milk supply by 25 per cent in the next three years
to meet forecast growth.
But other geopolitical factors cloud the company's future.

Mr Coleman said it was still too early to say how Russia's trade sanctions on Australian produce
would impact Bega's business.
The outlook came as Bega unveiled its full year results, reporting a $66 million profit in 2013/14, up
by 160 per cent on last year.
Net profit was inflated by the sale of Bega's holdings in Warrnambool Cheese and Butter which
was sold to Canadian company Saputo. Bega's stake was worth around $66 million after tax and
transaction costs. AAP
