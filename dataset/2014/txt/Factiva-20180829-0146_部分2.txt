Moody's Investors Service says today that Fortescue Metals Group Ltd's (Fortescue) production report for
the quarter ended December 2013 were broadly within our expectations and hold no rating implications.
Fortescue Metals Group's Corporate Family Rating (CFR) is Ba1 with senior secured term loan facility
rating of Baa3 and a senior unsecured notes rating of Ba2. The outlook on all ratings is stable.
"Total shipments guidance for FY14 of 127mt, towards the lower end of the company's previous
guidance, is broadly in line with Moody's expectation of around 125mt" says Matthew Moore - a Moody's
Vice President and Senior Analyst. "Therefore, production guidance at the lower end of the company's
guidance range does not impact on our expectations for cash flow generation or credit metrics", adds
Moore.

Under our base case assumptions of iron ore prices of around USD110 to USD120 (based on 62% Fe)
for the second half of the fiscal year ending 30 June 2014, we expect Fortescue's debt-to-EBITDA to
improve to close to 2.0x.
The company has also increased its capital expenditure guidance for FY14 to USD2.1 billion from
USD1.9 billion."The Capital expenditure guidance of around USD2.1 billion is still broadly in-line with our
expectation of around USD2.0 billion for FY14" says Moore. "The incremental capital expenditure can
more than adequately be accommodated by the large cash balance of $2.9 billion at the end of the
quarter and the strong operating cash flow generation expected by the company" adds Moore who is also
Moody'slead analyst for the company.
During the quarter the company also completed the construction of the Kings ore processing facility
(OPF) and announced that it is on track to ramp up operations at the Kings deposit to reach the 155mtpa
target production levels within the March 2014 quarter. The recent rating upgrade reflected the continued
progress the company has made on its expansion activities.

"The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Fortescue will continue to generate solid cash flow and
achieve its production targets following the completion of the current expansion activities", says Moore.

The ratings are not likely to be upgraded in the near term. Over the longer term, the ratings could face
positive trend if Fortescue demonstrates a track record of 1) consistently producing at the full expanded
155mtpa capacity and 2) maintaining a conservative financial profile such that Debt-to-EBITDA is
maintained below 2.0x through the cycle. In addition, a critical issue for a rating upgrade will be the
company's growth intentions post completion of the current phase of expansion. Achieving a more
geographically diversified customer base would also be supportive of a rating upgrade.
The outlook or rating could face negative pressure if the company experiences any unexpected
execution challenges with the remaining expansion activities, is unable to sustain production levels near
the 155mtpa target, embarks on any material further expansions, and/or adapts more aggressive
shareholder-friendly initiatives, such that credit metrics do not remain in line with Moody's expectations.
Iron ore prices sustained materially below our base case assumptions could also lead to negative
pressure on the rating or outlook. Financial metrics that Moody's would consider for a downgrade include
Debt-to-EBITDA exceeding 2.5x and FFO-to-Interest falling below 4.0x on a consistent basis
The principal methodology used in this rating was the Global Mining Industry published in May 2009.
