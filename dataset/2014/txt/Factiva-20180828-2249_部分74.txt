ANGLO American, a mining company with operations from Australia to Chile, will probably meet
earnings targets by increasing production and cutting expenses amid declining commodity prices.

"We have delivered on our major commitments to shareholders," chief executive Mark Cutifani said
before the company's investor day conference in London yesterday. "We have successfully turned
around a number of our priority operations this year, principally in our copper, Kumba Iron Ore and
coal businesses."

Seventy-one percent of Anglo's "priority assets" were now performing above plans, compared with 21
percent in 2012, Anglo said.
Coal

Cutifani also said the company was considering the sale of a couple of coal assets in Australia and
talking to stakeholders about its South African coal operations, too.
Coal prices have fallen to multi-year lows this year due to a glut of supply and weaker demand
growth, pushing some producers to curtail activity at sell-or-shut coal mines.
"We have indicated a couple of coal assets in Australia will be considered for sale," Cutifani said
ahead of the company's investor day.
"We have also indicated, when talking about some of the coal assets in South Africa, that we have
just started to talk with stakeholders in terms of domestic supply on the thermal coal side."
Cutifani, who began a review of operations after joining Anglo in April last year, plans to sell assets
that fail to meet his goal of increasing the company's return on capital to at least 15 percent by 2016.
That includes the sale of four labour-intensive platinum mines in South Africa after a five-month
strike that ended in June. He is also seeking buyers for three copper mines and a smelter in Chile.
Anglo, which cut its capital expenditure forecast by a range of $500 million (R5.7 billion) to $800m
for this year and $800m to $1bn next year, delivered its Minas-Rio iron ore project in Brazil about
$400m under its revised budget, it said.
Anglo on October 25 started iron ore shipments from the $8.8bn Minas-Rio mine.

The start of the project, which faced delays and cost overruns since it was bought in 2008, coincides
with a slump in iron ore prices as Australian and Brazilian producers expand capacity and demand
from China, the biggest user, stalls.
Minas-Rio would raise production to 26.5 million tons a year over the next 18 months to 20 months
to an operating cost of $33 to $35 per wet ton, Cutifani said.

through growth and restructuring, it said.
The company is also looking to fund the 2016 dividend from its cash flow.
