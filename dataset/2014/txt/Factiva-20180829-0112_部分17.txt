CHINA's BETTER THAN EXPECTED ECO NUMBERS CHEERED BY MARKETS
Our market closed up 32.1 points to 5420.3, although on light volume worth $3.3 billion with many
market participants already heading off on holiday.

BHP's results were excellent, but not better than expectations, in line with RIO's yesterday, with little local
news to excite today.

Meanwhile, some locking in of profits tomorrow before the four day break could be on the cards,
especially given the situation in Ukraine.

*Echo Entertainment rose 13c to $2.78 on 14.1m shares.

*Fortescue rose 6c to $5.39 on 19.9m shares after its profit result.

*Iluka fell 66c to $9.11 on 4.5m shares after its quarterly. A leading broker, retaining an "equal weight" on
Iluka with a price target of $10.80 said production is increased, but sales have appeared to lag rather
than lead production through 20145, contrary to full year guidance. "the company retains a sound fiscal
position and has not revised 2014 goals, but we see no near term catalysts'.

*McAleese fell 8c to 43.5c on 1.4m share after reporting March revenue and EBITDA fell, it also is
acquiring WA Freight Group for $15.4 mln funded from existing facilities.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures is up 340 points to 14,370 points, Shanghai CSI physical is up 4.39
points to 2105.99, Hang Seng futures is up 170 points to 22,826 points. S&P futures is up 5.6 points to
