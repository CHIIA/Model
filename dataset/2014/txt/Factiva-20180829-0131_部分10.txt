Kimberley Diamonds, whose shares were placed in a trading halt on Friday, has acquired the Argyle
Smoke Creek alluvial diamond project in Western Australia from Venus Metals.
The purchase provides Kimberley with a Joint Ore Reserves Committee resource of 6 million
carats, or $US210 million ($232.2 million) worth of diamonds in the ground, and comprises a
tributary leading from Rio Tinto's Argyle diamond mine, the world's main source of pink diamonds.

Kimberley's flagship Ellendale diamond mine already supplies about half of the world's yellow
diamonds.
While one of the company's former high-profile shareholders, Goldman Sachs Australia head
Simon Rothery, sold out last year, the last capital raising lured fresh funds from the likes of Hong
Kong actress Gigi Lai and investment powerhouse Sun Hung Kai Financial.

Kimberley will pay $250,000 in cash plus $750,000 in scrip to Venus Metals. The deal is expected to
be announced on Tuesday.
