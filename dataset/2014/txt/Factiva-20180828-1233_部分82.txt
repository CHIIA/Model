Trading points:

*AAI: To close Portovesme smelter in Italy

Alcoa announced last night it will permanently close its Portovesme smelter in Italy, reducing Alcoa's
global smelting capacity by 150,000 tonnes to 3.6 million tonnes per year, Alcoa said in a press release.
About half of the plant's production was aluminium billets, the rest was ingots and slabs.

*MMS: NPAT down 11.6%, 31c ff div, no DRP/fully recovered - outlook positive

McMillan Shakespeare Ltd for the year ended June 30 announced a net profit down 11.6% to $54.970
million on revenue up 5.3% to $347.457 million.

A final 31c fully franked dividend was announced. Ex date September 29, record date October 1. There is
no DRP.

Basic eps was 73.8c vs 83.4c last year.

Diluted eps was 72.7c vs 81.9c last year.

NTA backing per security is $2.11 vs $1.95 last year.
In commentary on the results the company said the business has fully recovered from the July 16 2013
proposed changes to novated leasing benefits and returned to strong growth.

Group Remuneration Services 2nd half 2014 revenue grew 8% on the pcp or 10% ex interest on the float.

Consolidated group 2nd half 2014 NPAT was up 10/% on the pcp.

Group Remuneration Services has good momentum going into 2015.
On Asset Management, the company said there was 9% portfolio growth on the pcp in a low growth
economic environment. It has commenced funding in the UK. It is a highly competitive environment - NIM
(net interest margin) is under pressure but holding up and new funding lines have reduced cost of funds.

Outlook

2015 should see another year of profitable growth. New products and services are expected to be
launched in both the UK and Australia during 2015. The business is well placed to make opportunistic
acquisitions.

Analysts expectations: $53 mln

*On May 15 a leading broker retained an "overweight" on SG Fleet with a price target of $2.05, saying the
lack of any meaningful changes in the Fringe Benefits Tax in the Budget suggests that near term risks
have fallen materially.

The broker compared SGF with Bloomberg consensus for MMS (not covered by the Broker):

SGF full year p/e forecast is 10.5x vs consensus for MMS of 11.7x

2015 EV/EBIT is 6.2x for SGF vs 9.8x for MMS.

Full year 2015 expected div yield is 6.4% for SGF vs 5.2% for MMS.

Full year 2013/15 eps growth is 2.5% for SGF vs 7.65 for MMS however excluding end of lease income
and significant items the broker forecasts core EBIT growth of 12% per annum for SGF. (Aug25)

Reporting today:

Page272of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*AIA: Auckland International Airport reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $NZ172 mln

*AWE: AWE reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $21.1 mln/$32.8 mln

*On July 30 a leading broker retained an "underweight" on AWE with a $1.37 target price. The broker said
AWE reported full year production of 5.67mmboe, in line with the broker's target and ended the quarter
with $42 million cash on the balance sheet and no debt./ Revenue was $60 million vs $93 million last
quarter, primarily due to the timing of liftings from Tui.

"We remain underweight over valuation concerns. Over the next few years, we expect flattish production
combined with higher depreciation charges .. AWE's AAL project is transformational, but its not yet
sanctioned and development risks remain" the broker said in the report.

*BKL: Blackmores reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $25.2 mln/$24.9 mln
Company guidance: On April 30 Blackmores said the continued growth over the last two quarters
supports directors' confidence that the group will deliver a full year net profit after tax broadly in line with
last year's result ($24.976mln last year).

*BLY: Boart Longyear reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $US68 mln/ neg $US47.1 mln.

On July 29 a leading broker had a "lighten" on Boart Longyear with a price target of 13c, down from 21c.
The broker said management continues to work on addressing myriad challenges, but persistent
weakness in global mineral exploration markets is likely to weigh on profitability and cash generation. "We
believe Boart's negotiating position is progressively weakening. In our view this increases the risk of a
highly dilutionary recapitalisation, an outcome which we don't believe is reflected in the current share
price".

*On July 28 a leading broker had a 'sell" on Boat Longyear after BLY's announcement of a first half
earnings update slightly below the broker's forecast.
The broker said it expects 2014 EBITDA to decline 47% to $US57 million, driven by ongoing pressure in
global mineral exploration activity and a sustained low utilisation rate of 33%. The broker also continued to
forecast a multi year downturn in exploration activity. The broker's 12 month target price is 21c.
Company guidance: On July 28 Boart Longyear Ltd President and CEO Richard O'Brien said in the report
the business overview fort he second quarter shows expected seasonal uplift.
Analysts estimates as of July 25 on Bloomberg for full year 2014 revenue ranges from $US766 million to
$US936 million and full year 2014 EBITDA estimates range from $US26/73 million.
The company does not intend to provide guidance for half year or full year periods, but believes analyst
estimates at the high end of the range may not fully reflect market conditions.

*CVO: CoverMore reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $27.9 mln, div 3.5c.
Company guidance: On June 18 Cover-More Group confirmed it expects to deliver on its prior guidance of
$50.1 million pro forma EBITDA for 2014 notwithstanding more difficult recent trading conditions in
Australia due to a softening in the rate of growth of outbound international leisure travel volumes.
On March 6 Cover-More had increased its pro forma EBITDA guidance for 2014 from $47.3 million to
$50.1 million, inclusive of an impact of $2.8 million from an interim underwriter profit share payment for
the 2012 underwriting year.

Cover-More operates travel insurance activities in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, India, Malaysia and is
in the process of commencing travel insurance operations in China, with their j/v partner having secured
an agreement with Qunar, a leading online travel agency group in China.

*FWD: Fleetwood reports for the year.

Page273of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Analysts expectations: $4.9 mln

On July 4 a leading broker retained a "hold" on Fleetwood with a $2.38 price target. The broker
downgraded 2014 eps forecast by 52% to 8.3cps. This has seen the price target fall to $2.38 from $2.66.
The broker added "While there is going to be a point where FWD starts to look reasonable value (NTA
$A2.49) we do not believe we're at that point yet".
Company guidance: On August 22 Fleetwood advised an impairment charge of $5 million will be booked
against the goodwill of its caravan manufacturing business as at June 30 2014. The charge reflects the
current challenging demand environment for recreational vehicles.

*On June 30 Fleetwood Corporation Ltd advised in a trading update it expects second half operational
EBIT will be approximately $3 million (vs $24.5 mln last year, which was down 69% on the previous year) .
Consumer confidence in some of its markets remains weak. Strong demand is being experienced in the
education sector in WA, Victoria and Queensland however there is lower occupancy at Searipple and poor
performance in the resource sector.
Steve Price, who announced his resignation as CEO recently, has since left the company. Search for a
replacement managing director is well advanced.

*MSB: Mesoblast reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $63.7 mln

*On July 24 a leading broker downgraded Mesoblast to a 'sell" with a price target of $3.20. The broker said
based on the clinical trial evidence to date it believes the development risks of Mesoblast's stem cell
products, particularly in its key heart failure indication, are not fully factored in at current valuations. "We
also review Mesoblast's recent acquisition of Osiris' stem cell assets. We do not yet ascribe any value to
the opportunity given Osiris' mixed clinical trial track record - we believe further clinical trials will be
required to validate the date in GvHD. MSB remains a longer dated and higher risk investment compared
to our coverage group" the broker added.
*NZO: New Zealand Oil reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $NZ9.2 mln

*PBG: PacBrands reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $49.5 mln/$52.4 mln div 1.5c.

*On June 13 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on Pacific Brands, with a price target of 55c, down from
61c earlier after PBG lowered its full year 2014 EBIT guidance by 15% to $90/93 million (2nd half 2014
EBIT guidance lowered by 30%) due to lower than expected sales and increased discounting with the
Underwear division the most impacted. PBG also advised it has retained Macquarie Capital to undertake a
strategic review.
Company guidance: On June 10 Pacific Brands Ltd announced it now expects full year 2014 EBIT before
significant items in the range of $90/93 million on sales growth of around 3% vs the prior year (vs EBIT of
$122.1 million last year, a turnaround from a loss the year before).
The company said at the time of its interim results announced the company had expected group EBIT
before significant items implied at $105 million.

"However a combination of challenging markets, declines in consumer sentiment and a warm autumn
which have been highlighted by other apparel and footwear retailers, have led to lower than expected
sales growth and increased margin pressure".

*PRU: Perseus reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $9.1 mln/neg $20 mln/Neg $3 mln

*On July 30 following its 4th quarter production result and an in-line 2015 guidance, a leading broker
retained a "neutral" on Perseus with a 12 month target price of 24c.
The broker said the key downside risk remains the gold price, given PRU operates at very thin margins,
hence small changes in the gold price can impact cash flow significantly. Upside risks include returning
Edikan to steady production rates following the recent issues as well as progression of the Sissingue
project.

Page274of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*Another leading broker on the same date retained a "hold" on Perseus with a price target of $50 vs $35
earlier. The broker said margins are boosted somewhat by gold hedges but Edikan makes little money at
spot gold prices and costs could increase as grades decline over time. However there is relatively low
operational risk, near term production growth is expected and it provides a cheap option on Sissingue
approval.

*On July 29 two leading brokers had "buy" and "add" recommendations on Perseus with price targets of
93c, down from $1 and 53c, down from 56c respectively.
The leading broker with a 93c price target said more investor patience is required. The gold volumes and
mine life at Edikan both remain compelling and have been reinforced by the exploration potential being
shown at Bokitsi South. The other leading broker said there is an opportunity for costs to be better than it
has modelled. "Perseus continues to offer highly leveraged exposure to the gold price and has a relatively
strong balance sheet" the broker said.

*On July 29 a leading broker with an "underweight" recommendation reduced its price target to 38c saying
production for the 4th quarter was up 7% on its estimate but 2015 guidance of 210/230K oz was lower
than its expectations. The broker now expects a small net loss in 2015.

*another leading broker on the same date had a "neutral" on Perseus with a price target of 24c. The broker
said the key downside risk remains the gold price, given PRU operates at very thin margins. Upside risks
include returning Edikan to steady production rates following recent issues as well as progression of the
Sissingue project.

*RCG: RCG Corp reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $11.5 mln

*SLM: Salmat reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $5.9 mln/$1 mln

*On July 26 a leading broker retained a "lighten" on Salmat with a price target of $1.85.

the broker said new management is confident of double digit top line growth in 2015 and margin expansion
from 2016. "We remain skeptical however given a cumulative annual sales decline of 3% from 2009 to
2013 and four downgrades in the past 12 months'.

The broker said the subdued retail environment is impacting catalogue volumes and the discretionary
direct sales business. Changing its focus to new markets such as online and products with less leverage
to the retail market will take time.
Company guidance: On May 19 Salmat Ltd announced revised earnings guidance for the year ending
June 30 of EBITA of around $14/16 million excluding significant items is now expected to be around $8
million excluding significant items.

Salmat confirmed its growth strategy remains on track with key success milestones being realised and a
strong sales uplift expected for full year 2015.

Salmat said in the report a subdued full year 2014 result is in line with the strategy outlined in July 2013.
The first goal, new platform sales has been achieved before financial year end and the second goal, the
technology transformation will be 90% complete by December 2014.
*SXY: Senex Energy reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $62.7 mln/$62.2 mln
*On July 29 a leading broker had an "equal weight" on Senex Energy with a price target down to 77c from
81c. The broker said SXY has increased its 2P oil reserve position by 4.5 mmbbls to end the year with
13.3 mmbbls of 2P oil reserves. Tghis should underwrite stable production at current levels fort he next
few years. "SXY's upside remains the commercialisation of its large unconventional gas resource base"
the broker added.

*VRT: Virtus reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $33 mln/$31.8 mln, div 14c.

*On July 1 a leading broker with an "add" on Virtus Health retained its $8.96 target price, saying Virtus has
well flagged its expansion into an overseas market and the Irish market is broadly similar to the Australian

Page275of399©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.market. "We think VRT should sit comfortably in clients' mid cap portfolios and positions should be
increased. VRT will deliver sustainable and defensive earnings growth over the medium term".

*On June 2 A leading broker with a "buy" on Virtus Health lifted its price target to $9.15 from $8.65 after
the announcement of its acquisition of 705 of SIMS IVF that controls around 25% of the Irish IVF market.

The broker said at the time of the IPO management had indicated they would consider moving their
successful model offshore, pointing in particular to opportunities in Singapore where VRT have a
dedicated office. More recently conversation pointed to opportunities in Europe. "This acquisition now
gives VRT footprint in both Europe and Asia and forms a springboard to further opportunities' the broker
said in the report.

*Another leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Virtus Health with a $7.66 target price.
The broker said the acquisition is strategically solid and with remaining balance sheet headroom, it is
likely that similar opportunities will be acquired. The broker said the Irish population is growing at 1% per
annum, with 15% of Irish couples possibly requiring VRT services given a declining birth rate since 2003.
