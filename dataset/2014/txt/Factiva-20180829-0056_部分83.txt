KKR & Co. is unlikely to raise its offer for Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. and could walk away if the
Australian vintner doesn't open its books to the private-equity firm, a person familiar with the matter
said Wednesday.

Treasury said the day before that it had rebuffed as too low a preliminary offer from KKR that valued it
at 3.05 billion Australian dollars (US$2.82 billion). Some industry analysts have speculated KKR
might sweeten its A$4.70-a-share cash bid to secure a producer whose wines range from California's
mass-market Beringer to premium Australian labels such as Penfolds Grange.

However, KKR is unlikely either to increase the offer without access to additional due diligence or turn
hostile by pitching the bid directly to shareholders, the person said. The private-equity firm appears
to be betting that shareholders, hoping for a higher price, will pressure Treasury to grant it
due-diligence access, the person said.

Treasury said Tuesday that it chose to disclose the bid after learning that KKR had spoken to one or
more of the wine company's shareholders. Treasury's board decided the offer, received in mid-April,
didn't reflect the fundamental value of the company, and so doesn't intend to take any further action.

A spokesman for KKR declined to comment.
Problems have dogged Melbourne-based Treasury since it was spun off in 2011 from Foster's Group
Ltd., the Australian brewer that later that year agreed to a takeover by SABMiller PLC. Poor U.S.
sales last year forced Treasury to destroy thousands of gallons of wine, leading to a A$155 million
write-down and contributing to the departure of former Chief Executive David Dearie in September.
On Tuesday, the company said conditions in Australia remain difficult, in part because of intense
competition. It forecast a A$35 million charge this financial year as it pushes through a program to
cut costs by A$35 million in fiscal 2015.
Treasury's board should engage with KKR, said Credit Suisse analysts Larry Gandler and Ben Levin
in Melbourne, who had earlier valued the wine company at A$3.15 a share, well below KKR's offer.

In a research report, the analysts suggested KKR might seek growth for Treasury's Australian and
U.S. brands in China, where KKR is invested in liquor-store network Vats Liquor. Other analysts and
investors have called on Treasury to sell its U.S. business or create a new listed company for
premium assets.
Treasury Wine, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said it held initial talks with
KKR after being approached about a deal on April 16.
The shares of the wine company rose 5.6% Wednesday to A$5.07, adding to an 18% jump Tuesday.
