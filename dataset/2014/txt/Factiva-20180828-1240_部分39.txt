RESOURCES: Mount Gibson Iron has lifted underlying profit as record ore sales offset a fall in prices.
It said it would continue to target further cost reductions and was well prepared for future volatility. Net
profit after tax fell 38.8 per cent to $96.4 million in the year to June 30, compared with $157.3m in the
previous year. But underlying net profit after tax, which excluded a $21.3m non-cash charge related to
accounting requirements for the Mineral Resources Rent Tax, rose 26.7 per cent to $117.7m in the
year. Revenue rose by 5.6 per cent to $913.5m, compared with $864.8m in the prior year. Mount
Gibson will pay a final dividend of 4c a share.

RESULTS: Yancoal Australia does not expect a marked improvement in global coal markets in the year
ahead, as the China-backed miner reported another first-half loss. Sydney-based Yancoal said there
were few signs the glut of coal was easing as prices of thermal coal have traded near multi-year lows.
“Significant global oversupply continues to weaken export coal prices, with minimal improvements
expected in the year ahead,” said Yancoal, which is 78 per cent owned by China’s Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. Yancoal reported a net loss of $192.7m for the six months through June. That was narrower
than the $749.4m loss a year ago, when currency swings increased liabilities on its US dollar
denominated debt.
ENERGY: Asia-focused oil producer Roc Oil said it is on track to meet full-year production guidance
after posting a 3 per cent lift in first-half net profit, excluding the profit from sale of non-core assets. The
company made $US53.8 million ($57.7m) in net profit after tax for the six months to June 30, which
included the $US32.6m in the sale of the BMG field. Sales revenue rose to $US143.4m, up from
$US114.1m.

MEDIA: Auction website Trade Me Group net profit rose slightly in the 2014 financial year but met
forecasts previously published by the company. Net profit for the 12 months to June 30 was up 2 per
cent to $NZ80.1m ($72.5m) from the prior year, while revenue rose 10 per cent to $NZ180.1m for the
2014 financial year. Trade Me chief executive Jon Macdonald said investments had been “substantial
but careful” over the year.
