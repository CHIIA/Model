Chinese billionaire Tong Jin Quan, the chairman of Shanghai-based Summit Property Development,
saw his stakes in Singapore real estate investment trusts (REITs) grow in the month of February. Tong
has been named the 35th richest man in China by Forbes, with a net worth of US$2.7 billion. Since Feb
18, shares in ÂSuntec REIT, Soilbuild Business Space REIT and Cambridge ÂIndustrial Trust had been
acquired on Tongâ€™s behalf by Wealthy Fountain Holdings Inc. According to filings with the Singapore
Exchange, Wealthy Fountain Holdings is wholly owned by Tong, through Shanghai Summit Pte Ltd.
Tongâ€™s other shareholdings include newly listed Viva Industrial Trust, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail
Trust, and OUE Commercial REIT.

On Feb 18, 5.1 million units of Suntec REIT were acquired by Wealthy Fountain, bringing Tongâ€™s
indirect stake to 114.4 million units, or 5.04% of the REIT. With that transaction, he is now the
second-largest shareholder of Suntec REIT, after Suntec City Development.

Suntec REIT recently broke ground at its North Sydney asset on 177 ÂPacific Highway, where
construction had begun on a 31-storey commercial Âtower. The Grade A commercial space is
expected to be North Sydneyâ€™s first new commercial tower in six years. With an estimated A$413.2
million ($472 million) price tag to build, the tower is expected to be completed in early 2016. 177 Pacific
Highway, which will offer a net lettable area of 423,915 sq ft, has been fully pre-committed, with
Australian property development group Leighton Group taking the head lease of 76% of the total net
lettable area.
For its FY2013 results released on Jan 23, Suntec REIT reported a 9% decrease in net property income
to $148.7 million, and a 0.9% decrease in distributable income to $211.2 million. The decrease was due
the partial closure of Suntec City mall, which is undergoing asset enhancement, mitigated by the positive
rental reversions from Suntec City Office and Park Mall Office during the year. Distribution per unit was
9.3 cents, 1.7% lower than that for FY2012.

On Feb 19, 502,000 units of Soilbuild Bizspace REIT were acquired by Wealthy Fountain. Tongâ€™s
Âindirect stake in the REIT, which Âspecialises in industrial business parks, now stands at 48.7 million
units, or 6.04% of the REIT, making him the third-Âlargest unitholder.

Soilbuild Bizspace REIT was listed on the Mainboard of the SGX last Aug 16, with a 3.2 million sq ft
portfolio of business parks, multi-user factories and single-user factories valued at $935 million. It has the
right of first refusal to four assets from Soilbuild Construction Group, the first of which is expected to be
acquired in 2015.

For 4QFY2013, Soilbuild Bizspace REIT announced a 1.51-cent DPU, 3.4% higher than forecast figures
in its IPO prospectus. Its net property income of $13.7 million and distribuÂtable income of $12.2 million
were, respectively, 2.1% and 2.5% above IPO forecasts. The groupâ€™s overall portfolio occupancy rate
rose 0.1 percentage point to 99.9%, owing to the expansion of an existing tenant at its Eightrium
business park. Seventeen per cent of the groupâ€™s net lettable area is due for renewal in 2014 and
about 47% of that has been pre-committed, with the rest under negotiations. Soilbuildâ€™s management
told reporters on Jan 23 that rental reversions for the year are expected to be positive as current spot
rentals were signed in 2010 and are below the current market rate.

acquired on his behalf by Wealthy Fountain. Now, Tong has an indirect stake of 103.8 million units, or
8.32% of Cambridge Industrial Trust, and is the single-largest unitholder.

CIT owns a portfolio of 47 properties with a total gross floor area of approximately 7.6 million sq ft, valued
at $1.2 million. The properties range from logistics and warehousing to light industrial, and are located
close to major transportation hubs and in key industrial zones throughout Singapore.

For FY2013, CIT announced a DPU of 4.976 cents, compared with the 4.784 cents announced in
FY2012. Net property income rose 5.5% to $80.4 million, while distributable income rose 6.4% y-o-y to
$61.3 million. The trust completed four acquisitions worth $92.7 million and started two asset
enhancement initiatives valued at $58.2 million that will complete in 4Q2014. Its $32 million proposed
acquisition of 11 Chang Charn Road, a 97,546 sq ft six-storey, purpose-built warehouse and light
industrial building located in Bukit Merah, is expected to be completed by 1Q2014.
