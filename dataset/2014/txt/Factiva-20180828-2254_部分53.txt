Banks, miners lead broad gains despite another iron ore slump

Stocks Max Mason

The Australian sharemarket has pushed higher, with broad gains across sectors, including the major
miners and banks, despite another slump in the price of iron ore. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 added
61.4 points, or 1.2 per cent, to close at the day's high of 5396.2. The broader All Ordinaries rose 59.4
points, or 1.1 per cent to 5324.1. The Australian dollar plunged to a four-year low overnight on Tuesday,
falling more than 1 per cent. It recovered marginally in the local session to US85.35ï¿½. The fall was
sparked by comments from Reserve Bank of Australia deputy governor Philip Lowe suggesting the
currency was still too high and that the RBA still had the option of cutting interest rates to help stimulate
growth. JBWere executive director Mike Kendall said the fall in the Australian dollar, Dr Lowe's comments
and a view that shares had been a bit oversold helped shares lift on Wednesday. "I think it's those factors
that are leading investors to dip their toes into the water today but it's still a very choppy market," Mr
Kendall said. The price of iron ore fell under $US70 per tonne for the first time in more than five years,
with concerns about the Chinese property market and oversupply continuing to weigh on the
steel-making ingredient. Iron ore has slumped more than

49 per cent this calendar year. Despite this, Rio Tinto shares finished Wednesday 1.7 per cent higher at
$58.39, while rival BHP Billiton gained 1.3 per cent to $32.53. Iron ore pure-play Fortescue Metals
slipped 0.7 per cent to $2.79,
BC Iron rose 2.6 per cent to 48.5ï¿½ and Atlas Iron sunk 4.9 per cent to 19.5ï¿½. Among financials,
Westpac lifted 1.4 per cent to $33.07 and Commonwealth Bank rose 1.1 per cent to $81.01. National
Australia Bank finished 1 per cent higher at $32.46 and ANZ gained 0.9 per cent to $32.38. Medibank
Private, on its second day of trading, fell 1.9 per cent to $2.10. Webjet shares slipped 1.3 per cent

to $3.10 after it warned that the domestic travel market is likely to remain flat for the rest of the current
financial year. Cabcharge shares lifted 2.3 per cent to $4.86, after director Rodney Gilmour resigned on
Wednesday morning. James Packer's investment vehicle Ellerston Capital sold down part of its stake in
Tabcorp, selling off 7.7 million shares. Tabcorp shares finished Wednesday 0.2 per cent lower at $4.16.
Ausdrill shares plunged 10.9 per cent to 45ï¿½ after after one of its clients, Resolute Mining said it plans
to defer expansion work at one of its miners. Resolute Mining shares posted the biggest gains among the
top 200, rising 19.6 per cent to 28ï¿½.
