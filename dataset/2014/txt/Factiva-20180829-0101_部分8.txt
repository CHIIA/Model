MELBOURNE, Australia--Units of Hong Kong-based conglomerate Cheung Kong Group have banded
together to make a 2.37 billion Australian dollar (US$2.21 billion) takeover bid for Australian natural
gas distributor Envestra Ltd. (ENV.AU), trumping an agreed offer from APA Group (APA.AU).

Envestra said the consortium's cash bid is worth A$1.32 a share. That represents a premium to
Envestra's last-traded share price of A$1.13, and the implied A$1.17 value of APA's cash-and-shares
offer.

The bid battle is the latest showing how investors are piling into Australia's booming natural gas sector.

Australia started taxing carbon emissions to encourage greater use of fuels that are cleaner-burning
than coal. The country is also experiencing a surge in demand for gas from nearby Asian countries,
including China, and has seven liquefied natural gas terminals worth 180 billion Australian dollars
(US$169 billion) under construction on its coastline to feed utilities overseas.

For investors seeking low-risk exposure to gas, pipelines that connect gas fields to export plants,
power generators and homes are typically monopoly assets that can provide steady returns.

The takeover tussle pitches existing shareholders in Envestra against each other. APA has a 33%
stake in Envestra and also manages its gas distribution networks and pipelines under a long-term
agreement. Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. (1038.HK) holds a more than 17%
interest in Envestra.
Envestra delivers natural gas to about 1.2 million customers across South Australia, Victoria,
Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory through thousands of kilometers of
distribution networks and transmission pipelines. It makes money by charging retailers for gas moved
through its networks.

The Cheung Kong consortium's offer needs support from Envestra investors holding at least 50% of
shares to succeed. It would also require approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board.

Envestra, advised by Goldman Sachs, said it was putting back together an independent board to
consider both bids. It also plans to ask the federal court to adjourn a shareholder vote on APA's bid that
had been set for May 13.

In addition to Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the bid consortium includes Power Assets Holdings Ltd.
(0006.HK) and Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (0001.HK), the flagship listed company of Cheung Kong
Group.

Envestra said it had been advised by the consortium that each of its members had sufficient financial
resources to fund their share of the offer, and that it didn't expect Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission approval would be a condition of the bid.

In August, the competition regulator said it wouldn't oppose an earlier all-share offer from APA that
Envestra's board had rejected. APA later returned with a revised bid comprising cash and shares.
