Ebos leads the way after Reserve Bank says interest rates may stay low for longer
New Zealand shares rose to a record led by Ebos Group amid optimism about its prospects in
Australia as it signalled a 10 per cent boost in first-quarter trading. The NZX 50 index rose 17.65
points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5387.83, its seventh consecutive record close. Within the index, 24 stocks
rose, 20 fell and six were unchanged. Turnover was $142 million.

Ebos advanced 5.2 per cent to $9.57 but has fallen 6.2 per cent since the start of the year. The
healthcare and animal care products company said it is tracking ahead of last year in the first three
months of trading, as it beds in a much bigger focus in Australia after its 2013 acquisition of
pharmaceutical firm Symbion. It also announced it bought Australia’s BlackHawk Premium Pet Care
pet food business for $57.8 million, which it expects will immediately add to earnings.
“The stock has been sold off, and this is a long overdue bounce back,” said James Smalley, director
at Hamilton Hindin Greene. The benchmark index is being pushed higher as central bank Governor
Graeme Wheeler kept the official cash rate on hold at 3.5 per cent this week and flagged rates may
stay lower for longer. “It’s a hunt for yield,” Smalley said. “It’s the inverse relationship between interest
rates and equity markets which has underpinned that rise.”
Regular dividend paying stocks rose. Genesis Energy advanced 1.5 per cent to $2.01. Spark,
formerly Telecom, rose 1.3 per cent to $3.155. Contact Energy gained 0.3 per cent to $6.20. Steel &
Tube climbed 3.1 per cent to $2.99. Fletcher advanced 1.4 per cent to $8.60. Government data
showed seasonally adjusted building consents rose 6.6 per cent in September from a year earlier.

Freightways climbed 3.6 per cent to a record $5.70, extending Thursday’s gains after the listed courier
and data management company recorded the strongest first-quarter performance in a decade.

OceanaGold was the worst performer on the day, dropping 9.6 per cent to $2.27. The
Melbourne-based miner, which operates the Macraes goldfield in Otago, reported a 61 per cent drop
in third-quarter profit to US$16.9 million.
Units in Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund were unchanged at $6.29. Chinese authorities have lifted a
temporary ban on the importation of Fonterra Cooperative Group’s whey powder and dairy base
powder.
Xero was unchanged at $15.85. The cloud-based accounting firm slowed its quarterly cash burn in
the September quarter from the June period.

Air New Zealand fell 0.5 per cent to $2.01. The national carrier and PT Garuda Indonesia have won
their bid to dismiss action against them in Australia. Heartland New Zealand was unchanged at $1.
