When Joanna Lee first saw the Mid-Levels flat she and her husband, Michael, an investment banker,
would eventually buy, it was in such a state she felt it could pass for something out of the 1970s. The
2,750 sq ft flat was dark, damp and smelly, but something about it - the high ceilings, its potential for
space - struck a chord.
"The apartment was in a poor condition and dated but I felt that as long as the space was there, I could
do something with it," says Lee. "I'm not a designer, though, and didn't have a vision. That all came from
Clifton Leung and his team."

Leung gutted the property and, among a host of changes, reduced the number of bedrooms from five
to four and substituted the fifth bedroom with a glass-walled study. He opened up the living and dining
areas and installed large glass doors leading onto the balcony to allow light to flood in.

Since the Lees and their three children were living in Australia while the renovations were taking place,
everything was done via Skype, e-mails and phone calls, with Lee paying only two visits to check on
progress. The renovation took about eight months, from initial concept discussions to completion.

"Technology is amazing in that it enabled me to see what was going on and make decisions without
actually being there," she says. "What also helped enormously was that Clifton really understood where
we were coming from. A family of five is larger than the average and we needed a design and layout
that worked for everyone."

Although open planning was the order of the day, the Lee children were about to hit their teenage years
when the family moved to Hong Kong three years ago, so a degree of privacy was also required. Leung
used sliding doors in larger-than-average doorways to section off the sleeping quarters and the kitchen
from the living area when needed.
"Joanna often jokes about how many doors she has ended up with but they give the apartment great
flexibility," says Leung. "Joanna and Michael love having friends over, so if they are entertaining in the
living room, for example, their children can shut off the entire corridor leading to their bedrooms and
enjoy their privacy. Smells from the kitchen can also be contained. But when all the doors are open, the
apartment has a flow of space from one room to the next."

Unlike a typical "out with the old, in with the new" renovation, the Lees decided to bring most of their
existing possessions with them. Again, thanks to modern communication technologies, Leung was able
to see what furniture they had and come up with a suitable layout and colour palette.

"We took pictures of our old house and the furniture we were bringing," says Lee. "Clifton and his team
then suggested wallpapers, colours and curtains that would match our things and our requirements. We
like our bedroom to be simple and functional, so the colours are in soft, neutral tones; my son's
bedroom has one black wall and dark brown pieces as he wanted something more masculine and
grown-up."

home, the family wanted similar facilities in Hong Kong and Michael's brief to Leung was that he
"needed to feel as though he was in a spa". Again, Leung didn't disappoint. He worked around a sunken
bath in the master bathroom, a feature of every flat in the block, modernising it and incorporating it into a
large shower stall rather than keeping it separate. Meticulous attention was paid to detail, to avoid
spoiling the overall look with unsightly but necessary features. The shower drain is partially hidden but is
still accessible for easy cleaning; light switches are positioned at mid-thigh rather than eye level. Leung
also added soft-blue lighting to create a muted, spa-like mood and a semi-partition in the form of
magazine shelving between the loo and the double sinks to give a degree of privacy.

"I spent a lot of time on the bathrooms, to make them look clean and peaceful but still functional," he
says.

Leung says one of his main challenges was thinking up ways to configure the galley kitchen to make it
usable. He lined it with custom-made cupboards, which were designed to be narrower than the norm so
the kitchen didn't feel cramped but nevertheless provided ample work surfaces.

"The long kitchen took a bit of getting used to but it has a surprising amount of space and is very
practical," says Lee.

Although she wanted white walls in the kitchen, she didn't want splashback tiling or glass. To stop drips
and splashes marring the look, Leung covered the textured walls in paint typically used for outdoor
areas because of its durability.

"I really use my home and I wanted us all to enjoy it, to be able to relax, work, entertain and live in it,
without worrying about it. That is exactly what we have," Lee says.
