DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

Page180of273©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The 166,000 hectare Walker Gossan project is located within the Walker Trough, a package of Middle
Proterozoic carbonate sediments, situated in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia.
Geographical maps and geological setting illustrations are available on the company's web site.
(www.gpmmetals.ca/projects/australia).
The primary area of interest is the Walker Gossan. Gossanous outcrops with highly anomalous lead
values were discovered by CRA - Conzinc RioTinto of Australia (predecessor to Rio Tinto Limited) in 1970
and a tenement application was made to the Government of the Northern Territory in 1972. An agreement
under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act is required prior to grant of the tenement. To date the area has been
held under tenement application and no exploration has been undertaken within the 40 years which have
followed the discovery of the gossan.

The Walker Trough is part of an extensive Middle Proterozoic carbonate sequence which occurs from
South of Mount Isa through to Darwin over an area of approximately 600,000 square kilometres which
hosts one of the great metallogenic belts of the world.
The region includes a number of major silver, lead, zinc and copper deposits. These include the Mount
Isa, George Fisher and MacArthur River mines owned by Xstrata; the Cannington Silver Mine, regarded
as the largest silver mine in the world, owned by BHP; the Century zinc deposit, one of the largest zinc
mines in the world and owned by MMG Mining of China; and several other deposits.

The Walker Trough region was identified by the Northern Territory Geological Survey team as being a
direct analogy of the Pb-Zn endowed Batten Fault trough which contains the MacArthur River Zinc mine.
Further, it was considered the "hottest untested exploration play in The Northern Territory" in a 2004
publication of the Northern Territory Geological Survey.
