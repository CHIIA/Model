After being in the limelight last week with Glencore's merger offer, iron miner Rio Tinto continues
to show why it is in demand.

Rio will release its third-quarter production report on Wednesday and Deutsche Bank is expecting
a 7 per cent increase in its Pilbara iron production from earlier-quarter results.

Analysts expect shipments from Pilbara to outpace production and estimate the company has a
stockpile of 10 million to 15 million tonnes.
Despite an expected 16 per cent fall in its copper production because of temporary maintenance
disruptions at its Bingham mine, Deutsche analysts have a "buy" rating for Rio with a 12-month
price target of $86.75 a share.
Rio Tinto shares closed at $60.81 on Tuesday. Its coal and alumina production will also be lower
due to the closure of its Gove refinery and the sale of its Clermont mine.
Morningstar analysts say despite the slowdown in Chinese demand for iron ore, as the world's
lowest-cost iron ore miner, Rio is best placed to weather the weakening iron ore price.
"Iron ore is more than 90 per cent of Rio Tinto's earnings and we expect it to stay more than
75 per cent in the long term," they said.
"Its iron ore margins and returns on invested capital for such a low-cost player even with a
reduced iron ore price are still superior to any of its other divisions."

Morningstar expects a fair value price of $60 a share for Rio Tinto.

Deutsche Bank said Rio's expansive Pilbara growth plans and cost targets were impressive.
At its last iron briefing, Rio says it will reach shipments of "more than 330 mega tonnes" in 2015,
and reaching 350 mega tonnes by 2017.
Deutsche Bank analysts continue to label Rio Tinto's iron ore business "still the best".
