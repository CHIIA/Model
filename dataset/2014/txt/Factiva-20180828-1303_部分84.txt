SYDNEY—Hong Kong billionaireLi Ka-shing emerged triumphant in a takeover battle for Australian
gas-transmission companyEnvestra Ltd. after a rival bidder agreed to support his 2.37 billion
Australian dollar (US$2.22 billion) offer.

The victory gives Asia's richest man access to a network of pipelines spanning a combined 14,000
miles that distribute natural gas to households and businesses in major Australian cities such as
Melbourne and Adelaide. It also adds to a string of offshore deals for Mr. Li in recent years as he
disposes of some assets in Hong Kong, and comes just days after it was revealed he was considering
a bid for an Irish aircraft-leasing company.

Mr. Li's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. is leading a consortium that offered A$1.32 per
Envestra share, which trumped an earlier bid from Australia's APA Group Ltd. and pitted two of
Envestra's biggest shareholders against each other.

Rather than raise its offer, APA said Thursday that it had decided to sell its 33% interest in Envestra to
the Cheung Kong-led group. "The cash offer put forward by the consortium well exceeded our valuation
of the Envestra business, even at full ownership," said Mick McCormack, APA's chief executive.
Mr. Li's offer for Envestra places a high value on the company by historical standards. The shares
have rarely traded as high as A$1.32, having previously only come close to that level in 2007, just
before the global financial crisis took hold.

In May, Cheung Kong said it would attempt to generate cost savings by combining Envestra's
operations with some of its other Australian power assets. Cheung Kong also owns 51% of both SA
Power Networks in South Australia state and Victoria Power Networks in Victoria state. Around 80% of
Envestra's assets are located in those two states.

Cheung Kong appears to be paying a relatively large premium for Envestra, based on other recent
deals in Australia's power sector, such as State Grid Corp. of China's acquisition of a stake in SP
AusNet Ltd., said Nathan Lead, a Brisbane-based senior analyst at broker Morgans.
"I just wonder if it's part of a bigger roll-up play for them," Mr. Lead said. "They've potentially got an
appetite for further investments in the energy infrastructure space."

In Australia, other potential publicly listed targets could include Spark Infrastructure, already Cheung
Kong's partner in Victoria and South Australia. Duet Group also has energy transmission and
distribution assets in Victoria and Western Australia states, while state governments have privatization
agendas that could spark Cheung Kong's interest.

Pipelines that connect gas fields to export plants, power generators and homes are typically monopoly
assets that can provide steady, regulated returns to investors. APA owns big pipelines to export hubs
and cities, while Envestra owns the thousands of "spaghetti" strands that run to separate end-users.

billion under construction on its coastline to feed utilities overseas, supporting a need for transmission
infrastructure and sparking a spate of deals in the pipeline sector. APA in 2012 paid US$1.36 billion for
rival pipeline owner Hastings Diversified, while last year local pension fund QIC Global Infrastructure
beat out Cheung Kong to buy the Moomba-to-Adelaide gas pipeline.

The outlook for domestic use of natural gas, however, remains cloudy after the conservative
Liberal-National government last month scrapped a tax on carbon emissions that would have
encouraged greater use of fuels that burn cleaner than coal.

Mr. Li is acquiring Envestra through a consortium that includes two of his other companies: Cheung
Kong Holdings Ltd. and Power Assets Holdings Ltd.
Another company that he controls, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., snapped up European assets including
an Austrian telecom company and a British water utility after the 2008 financial crisis softened asset
prices there and weakened the euro. In May, two of Mr. Li's companies agreed to buy an airport parking
lot operator in Canada for $397.5 million Canadian dollars (US$366 million).
In January, Mr. Li raised US$3.11 billion from listing his Hong Kong electricity operations. He also
recently sold a stake in his retail business A.S. Watson Co.
