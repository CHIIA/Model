Pilbara iron ore hopeful Brockman Mining has been rocked by the conviction of Hong
Kong-based chief executive Luk Kin Peter Joseph on bribery and corruption charges.
Dual-listed Brockman told the Hong Kong and Australian stock exchanges yesterday Mr Luk had
resigned immediately after being convicted by a district court on Tuesday.

Mr Luk was charged by Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption over
allegations he took a 1.5 million share kick-back during the $US15 million sale of a China Mining
Resources Group subsidiary.

Brockman said yesterday the case had no relation to Mr Luk’s position with Brockman, and it did
not expect the conviction and resignation to have a “material adverse impact”.

Brockman has been involved in a running legal brawl with Fortescue Metals Group’s infrastructure
subsidiary The Pilbara Infrastructure over access to Fortescue’s rail network, as it seeks a path to
market for its south-east Pilbara iron ore projects.
It had about $31 million at the end of June quarter.

Mr Luk is the second senior executive to quit Brockman in a month, after the resignation of its
Australian chief executive Russell Tipper two weeks ago.

Brockman shares closed untraded at 5.2¢ yesterday.
