2229 GMT [Dow Jones] BHP's (BHP.AU) demerger won't generate a material re-rating for the parent
company according to Credit Suisse. "At BHP's de-merged theoretical ex-rights price, we see BHP's
FY16 dividend yield increasing from 3.6% to 4.1%," the broker says. "With peers already at 3.8% to 4%
this suggests limited capacity for a re-rating." Credit Suisse analysts incorporate higher iron ore
volumes in their model, adding US$5 billion to their iron ore valuation. But higher assumed costs in
other business see outer year EPS reduced by about 2%-4% for FY16-17, offsetting their higher iron
ore valuation of US$84 billion. Rating remains underperform with a A$38.00 target price. BHP last
A$36.67. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2227 GMT [Dow Jones] New Zealand Prime Minister John Key's National Party continues to slip slightly
ahead of the September general election, according to the latest ONE News Colmar Brunton Poll. If
elections were held now, Key's National Party would win 48% of the vote, down two percentage points
compared with the prior poll, while Labour would win 28%, up two percentage points. The Green Party
would win 12%, up 1 percentage point. Among minority parties, the Internet-Mana alliance--an alliance
made up of a party registered by Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom and another that represents
indigenous people--would win 2%, down two percentage points. The poll was taken Aug 23-27.

2154 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian markets including the local NZX-50 likely to open a tad higher following
strength in the U.S. late Friday, says Forsyth Barr broker Dave Schaper in Nelson New Zealand. He
says while there are growing tensions in Ukraine he expects little impact of this on equity markets until
investors can see where things are actually headed. He adds that S&P lowering its long-term rating on
Fonterra is likely to have little impact on the stock although investors continue to make decisions on
whether they see Fonterra's tie-up with a large Chinese company as positive.

2128 GMT [Dow Jones] Demand remains strong for the USD as concerns grow about the situation in
Ukraine and rhetoric from Russia, says ASB Bank Head of Institutional Sales Tim Kelleher. The
EUR/USD is at 1.3129 vs. 1.3140 late Friday in New York. He says the euro is really struggling on
fundamentals at the moment and people are moving out of the common currency. Kelleher puts support
for the pair at 1.3100 with resistance coming in at 1.3150. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter:

2056 GMT [Dow Jones] The AUD/USD is likely to continue lower to 0.9300 given the positive USD
backdrop, says Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer in a note: "The U.S. dollar ended the quarter
with a flourish (Friday). UK PM Cameron raised the terror threat to the country to severe, helping the
U.S. dollar surge to a 14-month high." The AUD/USD is at 0.9320 vs. 0.9348 late Friday in Sydney. He
says Australia has 2Q inventories data and company profits releases but traders are likely to focus on
China's manufacturing PMI reports. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2030 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/USD slipped due to broad USD strength and the pair is smack in the
middle of the 0.8300 to 0.8420 it largely remained in through late August, says BNZ currency strategist
Raiko Shareef. He says commodity prices will take center stage locally: "Today, we expect that NZ's
official terms of trade will finally begin to account for dairy price decline seen earlier in the year. We pick
the 2Q reading to fall by 5.1% q/q." The market is expecting a fall of 2.5%. He says later this week the
ANZ commodity price index is due while the fortnightly dairy auction Wednesday will be closely
