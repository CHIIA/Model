SYDNEY--A Chinese-led group regained the upper hand in bidding for Aquila Resources Ltd. after the
Australian iron-ore miner rejected a rival proposal from Mineral Resources Ltd. valuing it at 1.54
billion Australian dollars (US$1.44 billion).
Directors of Aquila urged shareholders to accept a cash offer from China's Baosteel Group and
Australia's Aurizon Holdings Ltd. worth A$3.40 a share after talks collapsed over an all-share bid from
Mineral Resources worth A$3.75 a share.

"Aquila and Mineral Resources weren't able to agree terms that were acceptable to both parties,"
Aquila said in a statement. "Discussions between Aquila and Mineral Resources have now ceased."
Aquila said Executive Chairman Tony Poli, who holds nearly 29% of the company's shares, intends to
accept the offer from Baosteel and Aurizon.
Separately, Mineral Resources said it hadn't decided whether to sell a 13% stake recently acquired in
Aquila after confirming takeover talks had ended.
