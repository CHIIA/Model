New Zealand dairy firm Fonterra Limited plans to acquire a 20% stake of infant formula manufacturer,
Beingmate, to gain a foothold in China's dairy industry that has been rocked by scandals. The specifics
of the deal were not disclosed. The minority stake acquisition is completed, the 2 parties plans to
establish a joint venture with $A200 million in capital to purchase Fonterra's Darnum plant in Australia
and a distribution agreement for Beingmate to sell Fonterra's Anmum brand in China. Beingmate will hold
51% stake of the Australian dairy plant, and Fonterra will take the rest. The 2 parties aim to create an
integrated global supply chain from the farm gate direct to China s consumers. The infant formula market
in China is worth NZ $18 billion and is expected to be worth NZ$33 billion by 2017. This growth is driven
by increasing urbanization, higher disposable incomes, a preference for premium brands, and relaxation
of the one child policy.

Beingmate, Pingan Caizhi Investment Management and CEL Venture Capital has seen its adjusted net
profit for the first half year of 2014 slumped by 80% to RMB84.2 million, due to the sluggish customer
demand for its products. Both Chinese and Western private equity firms and investors have been
scrambling to strike deals in the Chinese dairy industry, to capitalize on the increasing demand of
high-quality dairy products in the country. Chinese private equity firms Yunfeng Capital and CITIC
Private Equity Funds Management (CITIC PE) agreed to invest RMB2 billion in a unit of Chinese dairy
firmInner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co. Ltd. Fosun International agreed to acquire 20.45% of the
dairy firmSanyuan Foods Co. Ltd. for RMB$2 billion. Asian private equity firm RRJ Capital agreed to
invest US $250 million in Bright Dairy & Food Co., Ltd.
