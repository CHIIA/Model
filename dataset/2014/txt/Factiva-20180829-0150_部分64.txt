AUSTRALIAN billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s risky gamble on China’s appetite for iron ore
is paying off, with Fortescue Metals Group getting its debt pile down below $US10 billion ($A11.19
billion).
Australia’s third-largest iron-ore miner, founded by Mr Forrest, said yesterday it was paying back
$US1.6 billion of debt not due until 2015 and 2016.

Cashed-up Fortescue is repaying the debt early to take advantage of an iron ore price that has
stayed above $US130 a tonne since last July, despite analysts predicting a drop.
The latest repayments will reduce gross debt to $US9.6 billion from a peak of $US12.7 billion last
year, with net debt down to $US7.8 billion from a peak above $US10 billion.
Debt repayments and refinancing have cut Fortescue’s annual interest payments by $US300 million.

The miner used debt to drive what was seen as a risky tripling of production over the past two years
to 155 million tonnes a year.
The world’s largest miner BHP Billiton produced 155 million tonnes of iron ore, its biggest-earning
business, two-and-a-half years ago.
Fortescue was forced into an emergency debt restructure in 2012 amid a cashflow crisis when iron
ore prices plunged.
But chief executive Nev Power is convinced Chinese demand will stay strong for at least another
two decades.
The latest voluntary payment underscored the company’s commitment to repay the debt that
funded its production expansion program that is due to be finished by March, Mr Power said
yesterday.

“The substantial increase in production and strong market conditions have strengthened our balance
sheet and enabled us to accelerate our debt reduction program,” he said.
Fortescue hopes to reduce its gearing — the rate of equity or capital to borrowed funds — from a
peak of 70 per cent to 40 per cent this year and to achieve an investment-grade rating from
agencies.

Fortescue has long been criticised for trying to grow too quickly, but analysts have acknowledged its
debt gamble is working out.

“If prices stay good for another year or so they will have a lot of debt paid off,” said Morningstar’s
Mathew Hodge.

making is obscene.

“Is that sustainable? I don’t think so. We are going to get more supply coming in too from BHP, Rio,
Vale, Gina Rinehart.”Fortescue’s shares rose 18 cents, or 3.5 per cent, to $5.33 yesterday.
