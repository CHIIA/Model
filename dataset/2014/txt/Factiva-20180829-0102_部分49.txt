Further reflection of the Audit Commission's report yesterday may have picked out that changes were to
occur gradually, and some not until the government's second term, bringing bargain hunters into the
market for a little buying.

However, with Ukraine still something of a tinder box, and a lack of inspiration from the markets (UK is
closed on Monday, Japan on Monday and Tuesday, China was closed today - US payrolls for April
reported tonight) buying is likely to remain off the back foot.

"We will probably close down about 15 to 20 points'

"Maree" said, "We will probably close down about 15 or 20 points. We have got our sights on the short
term and ahead of the Budget our market is not very confident. Once we know what we are dealing with
buying may pick up again, but right now it's not China, it's not the Ukraine that is dominating our thinking,
its what's going on here. There's just no interest in buying. There are a lot of unknowns, investor
confidence has gone. Meanwhile, the RBA has a problem. The high $A is holding inflation down (which
would rise if the interest rate is lowered)".

EPS was up 53% to $3.84 on the previous year.
APRA Basel III group regulatory capital of $A12.9 billion was $2.7 billion in excess of minimum
regulatory capital requirement.
Macquarie group managing director and CEO Nicholas Moore said in the report "Global market conditions
continued to improve in 2014, contributing to a significant increase in Macquarie Group's operating
income and profit, with all of Macquarie's operating groups delivering increased net profit contributions'.

Macquarie's annuity style businesses full year 2014 combined net profit contribution increased by $445
million or 26% on the previous year. Capital markets facing businesses combined net profit contribution
increased by $A450 million or 68% on full year 2013.

requirements of the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan, to commence on May 14 and be
completed by late June 2014. The shaes for the DRP will also be acquired on market.

Outlook

The managing director said in the report while the impact of future market conditions makes forecasting
difficult, it is currently expected that the full year 2015 combined net profit contribution from operating
groups will be up on 2014, broadly offsetting the 2014 realised gain relating to the SYD distribution.

The FY 15 tax rate is currently expected to be broadly in line with 2014.

*Most recently, on April 24 a leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Macquarie Group while lifting its
price target to $60.30 from $55.90 (and up from $55.20 before MQG's March 24 guidance). The broker
said over the past six years the immediate reaction of MQG's share price to the full year result has been
driven by the outlook commentary. We expect this trend to continue and that management will guide for
profit in 2015 to be up on 2014.

The broker added, in its view consensus forecast for full year 2015 profit to be up 15% on this year vs the
broker's forecast of 2015 profit to be up 20% on this year - does not look too bullish.

*Following MQG's updated guidance on March 24 leading brokers retained "neutral" price target $50.46,
"neutral", price target $52; "outperform", price target $63; "hold" price target lifted to $57 from $56.
Company guidance: On March 24 tabled its presentation to be delivered at the Credit Suisse 17th Asian
Investment Conference in Hong Kong on March 26/27.

In its presentation to investors and analysts MQG advised since its first half result announcement market
conditions continued to show signs of improvement, however client activity remains subdued for some
capital markets facing businesses.

Macquarie's annuity style businesses (Macquarie Funds, Banking and Financial services and Corporate
and Asset Finance continue to perform well with combined December quarter net profit contribution up on
the previous corresponding quarter and the September quarter.

"Accordingly we currently expect Macquarie's result for full year 2014 to be up approximately 40/45% on
2013, subject to the completion rate of transactions and the conduct of period end reviews'

significant sales impact of the refurbishment of 3 of the top 20 stores and the commencement of a
refurbishment at the Macquarie NSW store in February.

recently the closure of the store at Elizabeth (SA) in February.
