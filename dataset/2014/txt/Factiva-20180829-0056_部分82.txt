Back in beef: While the vast bulk of Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest's wealth is firmly ensconced in Fortescue
Metals Group, the billionaire's recent foray outside of mining has raised questions if beef is the new
iron ore. In May, Mr Forrest spent $30 million on Harvey Beef, WA's largest beef processor, through his
Minderoo Group. Harvey Beef is the only company in WA accredited to export to China, still seen as
both the Holy Grail and untapped market of the beef industry. Mr Forrest is not the first to diversify from
mining into agriculture, with early Fortescue Metals backer Leucadia National Corp dropping close to $1
billion on buying a stake in United States processing giant National Beef in 2012. In fact, the link
between WA-based miners and cattle is well established and goes back some years.

BillionaireGina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting owned at least $60,000 worth of livestock when the
public got a look at the books back in 2011, while mining giant Rio Tinto owns a number of large
Australian pastoral leases including tens of thousands of cattle. As the Chinese economy shifts from a
centrally planned economy to one driven by consumption, Twiggy's beef play seems well-timed.
