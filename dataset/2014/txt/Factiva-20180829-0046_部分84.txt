A CHINESE company keen to get into the hotel business has paid around $10 million for the
Newport Mirage hotel on the waterfront.
Kop International Pty Ltd has commercial property interests in China. This is the Shanghai-based
company’s first purchase of an Australian hotel.

Andrew Jackson, of CBRE Hotels, said the new owners had already taken possession of the
47-room hotel on 1795sq m of land.
“They have retained all the staff and will continue running it as a boutique hotel and popular wedding
function centre,” he said.
“Really, it is just a change of owners.” The business and property was previously owned by the
Bayfield family, who still own the neighbouring Newport Arms Hotel.
Earlier, Mark Bayfield said the family had bought the hotel and conference centre in 2000 as an
investment.According to RP Data, the property, at 2 Queens Pde, Newport, sold for $8.55 million
but the final amount paid for the land and the business was around $10 million.
