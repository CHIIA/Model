The elegant Classic factory in the heart of Sydney's Redfern suburb once manufactured cigarettes,
lathes and milling machinery before it starting turning out the sports jerseys, kitting local league and
rugby teams.

This year, it will be reborn as sleek New York-style warehouse apartments with hardwood floors,
exposed concrete-work and enormous loft-sized windows under the hand of SJB's Adam Haddow and
BKH interior architect Iain Halliday.

Lead by Cornerstone Property Group, the $16 million transformation of the two heritage listing
factories at 267-271 Cleveland Street generated more than $37 million in pre-sales on Saturday, when
every single one of the 39 apartments sold.
One-bedroom apartments started at $595,000. A lavish three-level townhouse style apartment was
listed for more than $1.65 million, while top-floor apartments had price tags exceeding $2.25 million.

A 700 square metre ground floor retail space with exposed brick walls and original brick and mortar
kilns – best known for its former tenant, Chinese homeware retailer, Mao and More – is being
marketed to restaurant operators. Cornerstone took hold of the site in March 2013 in what's
understood to be an off-market deal thought to be worth more than $16 million. At the time, Classic
Sportswear owner James Clive Brennan had held the building for 22 years, after paying $1.8 million in
1991.Sixtieth project
The project comes as the 60th residential project for Sydney based developer Cornerstone, since
chief executive Michael Grant founded the group on the Northern Beaches 20 years ago.
The group's biggest projects to date include Casba at Danks Street in Waterloo, a $90 million
residential and retail project with 65 apartments, built on top of the former Winnings Appliances'
factory. The popular retailer now has a state-of-the-art at ground floor.
In 2010, the group completed the $80 million Holt&Hart commercial development in Surry Hills, with
Cue Clothing as an anchor tenant, in addition to ground floor restaurants MoVida and Guzman Y
Gomez.
A Surry Hills commercial property at 119-121 Kippax Street is expected to be up next on the group's
drawing board for redevelopment.

Cornerstone took hold of the mixed-used building on the city fringe in a $24.475 million deal in March.
The 6752 sq m was sold on a passing income above $900,000 a year.
An iconic Sydney company, Classic still makes jerseys and uniforms for the State of Origin teams and
the Canberra Brumbies. The group occupied 2½ floors of the building until eight years ago, when it
relocated its manufacturing to Camperdown.
