BIBLIOPHILES and record collectors, put down your books and earphones.

There's a giant weekend sale on — a sale that will have you having the time of your life, digging the
Dancing Queen.

No, really, says Kathryn Dickinson, Rotary Club of Galston's Giant Book Fair chairwoman and a secret
ABBA fan.

"I'll have the record player going so people can hear some of the more than 2000 45rpm and 78rpm
vinyl records we are selling, including many collectibles such as ABBA and The Beatles," Mrs Dickinson
said.

There's also more than 50,000 books the club's half a dozen volunteers have sorted into about 50
categories — some new; others dating back to the 1800s.

"I think people who drop them off sometimes don't often realise their true value," Mrs Dickinson said.
"Last year, for example, one book was worth $2000."

The fair will have a separate children's section where the younger ones can browse at their leisure.

And you don't even have to wait until you get home to start reading.
Settle in with a coffee in the on-site cafe, or drive to nearby Fagan Park, on the same street.
The picturesque park was originally owned by the Fagan family and operated as an orchard and cattle
farm, and has 11 themed gardens, including Japanese, Dutch, Chinese and Mediterranean.
The fair raises money for 17 charitable organisations and individuals in need and will also offer for sale
nearly 2000 CDs, several hundred DVDs, films, jigsaw puzzles and board games.

■ Rotary Club of Galston's 16th annual Giant Book Fair is on July 26-27, 8am-5pm at Galston
