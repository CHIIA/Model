The agreement could create export financing opportunities for further iron ore development in Western
Australia.
ANZ has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the China Development Bank (CDB) and
a second agreement with the CDB, Aurizon Holdings and Baosteel Corporation. The MoUs were signed
on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Brisbane, which was attended by China’s President Xi Jinping.

The ANZ-CDB MoU will promote foreign direct investment into Australia from Chinese enterprises. It is
also in line with China’s policy to increase transparency and accountability for its outbound foreign
investments, according to a release from ANZ. The two banks will aim to match corporate partners and
provide financial services.

ANZ, CDB, Aurizon Holdings and Baosteel have signed an MoU for the potential development of the
West Pilbara iron ore project. The project could produce tenders for mine development, iron ore
processing and contracts for associated infrastructure. This includes a 280km railway and a new
deepwater port in Anketell, Western Australia.

Aurizon Holdings and Baosteel are proponents of the proposed West Pilbara project, according to local
media reports. The pair acquired the rights to procure the project after their $1.4 billion takeover of
Aquila Resources. Aquila is a US-based mining exploration company.
The West Pilbara project could be financed in a similar way to the $10 billionRoy Hilliron ore mine also
located in the Pilbara region. The Roy Hill project featured export financing debt and equity
commitments from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the Export-Import Bank of Korea and
the Export-Import Bank of the United States. It achieved financial close earlier this year.
China and Australia signed a free-trade agreement at the G20 Summit earlier this week.
