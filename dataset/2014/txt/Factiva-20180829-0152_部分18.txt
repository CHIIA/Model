Asian stocks rally with the regional benchmark index heading near its highest in two months, after slower
growth in U.S. payrolls which eased concerns that Federal Reserve will cut stimulus. Moreover, Newcrest
Mining Ltd., a Australia gold producer, advanced 6.2% in Sydney as the precious metal climbed after the
American jobs data. Dongbu Steel Co. jumped 6.4%, heading for the highest closing level in two months,
after the Maeil Business newspaper reported companies are interested in buying one of its factories and a
stake in Dongbu Metal Co. Hyundai Motor Co. climbed 3.9% in Seoul as consumer discretionary firms
posted the largest gains among the 10 industry groups on the regional benchmark index. At the same
time, The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 0.6 percent to 460.07 as of 9:41 a.m. in Hong
Kong, which considered the largest advance since Nov. 18.
