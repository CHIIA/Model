AUSTRALASIA’S largest real estate group Ray White has achieved a resounding success at a
combined commercial property auction event on the Gold Coast with seven out of the 12 listings
selling under the hammer.
More than 150 people attended the August 15 event hosted by Ray White Commercial Gold
Coast at the Gold Coast Convention Centre at Broadbeach, with almost $7million worth of sales on
the day.

A two-storey tenanted building in a prime Chinatown location at 22-28 Davenport St, Southport,
achieved the top price with an Asian buyer paying $1.6million for the property marketed by Ray
Commercial Southport’s Wayne Devenport and Luke Boulden.
A strata-titled restaurant space fronting the Broadwater at 8-9/300 Marine Pde, Labrador sold for
$810,000, $200,000 above its reserve price, through Adam Young of Ray White Commercial Gold
Coast.

Auctioneer Richard Impiombato said it was an outstanding result to see seven of the 12 properties
sold under the hammer.
“There is strong confidence from the agents involved that the remaining properties will be sold
within the next week,” Mr Impiombato said.

“We had a great turnout and the room was full of energy with some spirited bidding for many of the
offerings, with more than 60 separate bids on one property.”
Ray White Commercial Gold Coast director Greg Bell said there was a remarkable amount of
interest from Asian parties.
“Three properties sold to Asian buyers, and we had Asian parties bidding on every property,” he
said.
“Southport is particularly appealing to Asia-based buyers with the emergence of the Chinatown
precinct and relaxed development restrictions associated with its status as a priority development
area.”
The listings came from Ray White Commercial Southport, Ray White Industrial Gold Coast and
Ray White Commercial Gold Coast.

Combined Gold Coast auction events are also scheduled for October, November and December
this year.
