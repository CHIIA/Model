APPLE

Apple Wins Antitrust Case

Over Competition for iPod

A jury ruled in favor of Apple Inc. on Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit that accused the technology giant
of violating antitrust laws by suppressing competition for its iPod music players.

After deliberating for only about three hours, an eight-person jury in U.S. District Court in Oakland,
Calif., found that Apple's iTunes 7.0 was a genuine product improvement, and therefore didn't violate
antitrust laws. The decision was unanimous.

Apple applauded the jury's verdict. "Every time we've updated those products -- and every Apple
product over the years -- we've done it to make the user experience even better," the company said in
a statement.

The plaintiffs had said Apple made changes to its iTunes music service so it was incompatible with
other companies' devices, driving up the price of iPods. The plaintiffs, representing potentially eight
million harmed consumers, were seeking $350 million in damages, which could have been tripled
under antitrust laws.

For now, the verdict closes a 10-year legal battle over the iPod.

BLACKBERRY
Company Launches Phone

With Keyboard and Trackpad

BlackBerry Ltd. unveiled a new device on Wednesday meant to appeal to the smartphone maker's
traditional customers with signature BlackBerry phone features like a physical keyboard and trackpad.
Dubbed the Classic, the new phone is part of the Canadian company's plan to reignite sales and return
to profitability by focusing on business customers after its previous attempt to appeal to consumer
customers fell flat. The plan also focuses on increased sales of management-device software and
security services to enterprise customers. The Classic has a traditional qwerty keyboard, a row of
navigation keys to manipulate the device's operating system and a trackpad to scroll through lists.

In the U.S. the Classic will cost $449 unlocked. That is $50 more expensive than a BlackBerry Bold
9900 .

SYNGENTA
China Approves Biotech Corn
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has approved a controversial biotech corn, Syngenta's Agrisure
Viptera, one year after China began rejecting shipments of grain it said contained traces of the
unapproved trait, according to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
Mr. Vilsack said Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang told him during a meeting of U.S. and Chinese
officials in Chicago that the corn and two biotech soybeans had been given the green light for import.
Mr. Vilsack said the two had also discussed the need for a "high-level strategic dialogue and discussion
on innovation in agriculture generally."
Syngenta submitted the corn for Chinese regulatory review in 2010.
