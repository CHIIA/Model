SYDNEY, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Oz Minerals Ltd said on Monday a copper and gold mine it wants to
develop in Australia could generate A$22.1 billion ($20.58 billion) in revenue over more than 20 years
but will require a partner to proceed.
The company's projections, based on a target of 114,000 tonnes of copper and 117,000 tonnes of
gold a year coming out of the company's Carrapateena project, drove Oz Minerals shares 3 percent
higher to A$4.40.

Copper mining is one of few sectors investors appear willing to risk capital in developing as
commodities markets in general cool in step with slowing growth in China.
Morgan Stanley forecasts a supply surplus of copper concentrate will shrink to around 87,000 tonnes
by 2018 from 580,000 this year.
BHP Billiton , the world's biggest diversified mining house, includes copper as one of its "pillars of
growth" and owns a majority stake in the world's biggest copper mine in Chile.
Rio Tinto is investing heavily in Mongolian copper mining through its 51 percent stake in Canada's
Turquoise Hill Resources, while China's MMG Ltd and its partners have paid $7 billion for the Las
Bambas copper project in Peru.
Oz Minerals, capitalised at A$1.34 billion, has been looking for partners to help shoulder the A$2.985
billion it forecasts will cost to get the mine up and running later this decade. The deposit is located 100
kms (62 miles) from the BHP-owned Olympic Dam mine, another giant copper mine.
"We have reviewed in detail numerous copper-gold projects around the world over the past five years
and there are very few like Carrapateena which offer the potential of multi-decade production at low
operating costs," said Oz Minerals Managing Director Terry Burgess.
OZ Minerals has put a net present value on the project of A$1.15 billion based on a pre-feasibility
study, higher than previous estimates by analysts of around A$500 million.

"It doesn't have a great return, it only has an internal rate of return at 13 percent, with a very very big
price tag of A$3 billion so I think they'll be quite challenged to find anybody that's prepared to buy into
the project at that kind of the price," said Brenton Saunders, a portfolio manager with BT Investment
Management.
"So to come out and say it's now worth A$1.1 billion is quite a big difference so I guess the market is
reacting to that," Saunders said.

It is unlikely that OZ Minerals will have the financial capacity to bear all of the cost and project risk.
A sell-down of its interest through a joint venture could form part of the funding mix, the company said.
