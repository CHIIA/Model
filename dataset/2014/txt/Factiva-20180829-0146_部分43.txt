The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close lower today.

Markets rose in Europe, the UK and US last night.

On the NYSE where 3203 issues traded there were 2,314 issues higher, 788 down and 101 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2700 issues traded there were 1,761 issues higher, 860 down and 79 unchanged.
Metals were mixed, crude rose, gold was barely changed. The $A is at 87.70US c, down a few from last
evening.

"I think our market will finish down 34 points"

"Maree" said, "Expectations that our market will have a better day today following gains in the US market
will be short lived.

"Downward pressure from emerging markets will keep our market capped.
"With the NAB's UK exposure and Australian banks lending to Chinese borrowers up by 75% in a year, I
expect the banks to be sold today.

"I think our market will finish down 34 points".
Maree added, "We rose on the coat tails of the Chinese expansion, with manufacturing from the US and
Europe flowing into the emerging markets where labor was cheaper. But now the cycle has turned.

"People are working for a lot less money in Europe and the US - eg, in Europe there are Spanish builders
undercutting French builders in bidding for jobs in France. In the UK, competitive bidding for work at lower
wages is becoming more frequent.

"It is no longer as viable to export manufacturing to emerging economies, where you are also subject to
the laws of a foreign country - so manufacturing in China is declining while it rises in Europe and the US".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 65.8 points to 5175.1 points last evening.

January 29. Good morning.

Trading points:
*Nomura lifts mining sector rating to "neutral", BHP and Rio named top picks
A gauge of mining companies rebounded from its lowest level in almost two weeks in the UK after
Nomura Holdings Inc raised its rating on the industry to neutral from bearish. The brokerage said
companies may reduce costs by more than analysts predict.

BHP Billiton and RIO Tinto were named as top picks by Nomura.
*China smog crackdown to boost demand for high grade iron ore

A Reuters report in the Western Australian yesterday (grateful thanks to Reader who forwarded) was
picked up by other international news agencies last night, including the Financial Times - suggesting that
Chinese demand for high grade Australian and Brazilian iron ore could squeeze out exporters of lower
grade suplies from Iran, Mexico and Vietnam.

*BLD: Strong 1st half profit, 2nd half profit to be significantly lower

Boral Ltd announced it expects Net Profit After Tax before significant items for the first half of 2014 to be
approximately $90 million, subject to finalisation of the audit review. (Vs a net statutory loss of $25.3
million for the half year ended December 31 2012 vs a profit of $152.7 million for the previous
corresponding period (pcp) on revenue up 14% to $2.773.8 billion.
Net profit before significant items was down 21.7% to $52.2 million)

The result is underpinned by favorable weather conditions in Australia, strong volumes from major
projects, a significant turnaround in the performance of the Building Products division and benefits from
the prior year restructuring activities.

For full year 2014, Boral expects a significant skew of earnings to the first half of the year compared to the
second half, due to factors including lower contribution from major projects, reduced contribution from
Boral Gypsum following the move from a 100% owned division to a 50% j/v on completion of the
transaction with USG during the second half and significantly lower levels of expected profits from
property sales for 2014, which in prior years have traditionally benefitted the second half.
Boral will announce its first half 2014 results on February 12. (Jan 28, posted 8.33 a.m. missed by us
earlier, deepest apologies).

*CFU: Handelsblatt report on CFU - "Silent Power Plant for the Basement"

Handelsblatt in a report today entitled as above said, " It is as big as a dishwasher, generates electricity
and heat and is still one of the luxury goods among the home appliances: a fuel cell power plant.

It is almost inaudible by day, by night - always. In submarines, space shuttles, cars and even in German
boiler rooms. Fuel cells are considered an exotic, when it comes to supply a house with heat and
electricity. But the technology is on the rise because more and more manufacturers are venturing out to
the production of small series.
Ceramic Fuel Cells is one of them. Since early 2012, the Australian-German company micro power plants
that come along with the efficiency of modern gas power plant and the size of a commercial washing
machine. In North Rhine-Westphalia Heinberg the result is a device that can make a significant
contribution to the energy turnaround.

By means of a solid oxide fuel cell in which electricity and heat is generated when connecting hydrogen
and oxygen from the air to water, the manufacturer wants to achieve an overall efficiency of up to 85%. All
it takes is beside a stream connection, the supply of gas and water. The BlueGen uses both natural gas
as well as biogas for the necessary hydrocarbons to bring the reaction. This all takes place at
temperatures of about 750 degrees Celsius, resulting in the combustion of the gas.

BlueGen combines a small natural gas boiler with the fuel cell technology and has thereby created an
efficiency-Beast for the cellar. Every year, the unit supplies namely up to 13,000 kilowatt hours of

Page123of273©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.electricity, which is at a price of 12 cents per kilowatt hour, according to manufacturers. But even in this
case there is again a problem: An average four-person household can not consume as much electricity.
Although the excess energy can be returned into the net, the feed-in tariffs are rather low: less than five
cents per kilowatt hour. In terms of the purchase price of around Euro 33,000 - that's almost as much as
for three conventional gas heaters.

Many a private consumer has for this reason been prevented from replacing a faulty gas heater with a fuel
cell model.

The hope of all manufacturers is the same: With more funding and mass production, the technology can
be significantly more affordable in the coming years".
