RANGE TRADING ON LOW VOLUME
Our market up 6.6 points to 5409.9 on low volume worth $3.5 billion after trading in a narrow range all
day. The $A is at 92.18US c, down about 15 points from last evening.

With a "horror budget" expected to be brought down on May 13, which could alter the earnings outlook
for several companies, it is likely that, in the absence of market moving news, investors will continue to sit
on their hands - and look to tax loss selling perhaps pre-Budget.

*NAB shed 19c to $35.37 on 4.5m shares after the surprise announcement that Cameron Clyne would
leave in August.
*Goodman Fielder was up 3.5c to 51c on 53 million shares, recovering after telling it "like it was'
yesterday, when it fell 3.5c to 47.5c on 28.5 million shares.

*Dr Glenn Stevens made a brilliant speech in Brisbane today, outlining where we are and potentials that
lie ahead and also quoted his colleague Dr Martin Parkinson's speech yesterday.
*China's official non manufacturing gauge fell to 54.5 in March from 55 in February, announced today,
Bloomberg reported.
*China will sell 150 billion Yuan ($US24 billion) of bonds this year to fund railways for less developed
regions and to extend preferential taxes to more small companies, the State Council had said yesterday.
China Railway Group rose 5.6% in Hong Kong, China Railway Construction Corp rose 8.1%.
