Banpu Public Co. Ltd. said Nov. 11 that its run-of-mine coal production came to 12.8 million tonnes in
the third quarter, higher than 10.6 million tonnes a year earlier.
Of the total production for the period, 8.2 million tonnes came from the company's operations in
Indonesia while the remaining 4.6 million tonnes were from its Australian operations.

Banpu sold an aggregate of 12.4 million tonnes of coal for sales revenue of US$852.0 million during the
quarter.
It posted a net profit of US$4.1 million, much lower than the US$21.9 million it recorded in the
corresponding period in 2013. This was due to the effect of a reversal of US$24 million in deferred taxes
due to the Australian government's repeal of the minerals resource rent tax.
EBITDA for Banpu's coal business slid 5% year over year to US$149 million. The company's total
EBITDA likewise slipped 13% from last year to US$167.2 million.

In a separate release, Banpu said its fully owned subsidiary Banpu Power International Ltd. entered into
an equity joint venture agreement to co-develop the Shanxi Lu Guang power project, a new
1,200-megawatt coal-fired plant in China.
Under the deal, Banpu will hold a 30% interest in the project with Shanxi Lu'an Mining Group and
Gemeng International Energy Co. Ltd. as partners.
