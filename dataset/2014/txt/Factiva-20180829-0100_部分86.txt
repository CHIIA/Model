Moody's Investors Service has assigned a provisional (P)A1 rating to the credit enhanced bonds to be
issued by Guotai Junan Financial Holdings (BVI) Limited (unrated).
The bonds will be supported by an irrevocable and standby letter of credit from the Bank of China Limited,
Sydney Branch (BOC, A1/P-1, stable).

Issuer: Guotai Junan Financial Holdings (BVI) Limited
.... U.S.$[] [] per cent. Credit Enhanced Bonds due [], assigned (P)A1
The rating of the bonds addresses the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity.
Moody's issues provisional ratings in advance of the final sale of the securities. The ratings, however,
only represent Moody's preliminary credit opinion. Upon conclusive review of the transactions and
associated documents, Moody's will endeavor to assign a definitive rating to the bonds. A definitive rating
may differ from a provisional rating.

Moody's rating addresses only the credit risks associated with the transaction. Other non-credit risks have
not been addressed, but may have a significant effect on yield to investors.

RATINGS RATIONALE
The (P)A1 rating of the bonds is the same as BOC's foreign currency long-term senior unsecured debt
rating of A1, because the bonds are fully supported by an irrevocable USD-denominated standby letter of
credit provided by BOC.

The standby letter of credit is an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of BOC.

BOC's payment obligations under the standby letter of credit will at all times rank at least equally with all
of its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch will be the principal paying agent and its Hong Kong
Branch will be the account bank for this transaction.
The issuer, Guotai Junan Financial Holdings (BVI) Limited, is a limited liability company incorporated in
the British Virgin Islands. It is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Guotai Junan Securities Co., Ltd.
Both entities are not rated by Moody's.
Bank of China Limited is headquartered in Beijing. It reported assets of RMB15.1 trillion (approximately
USD2.5 trillion) as of 31 March 2014.

Moody's analysis of the transaction is based primarily on the unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of
BOC to support the payment of the bonds through the standby letter of credit.
As such, the rating of the bonds is directly linked to the foreign currency senior unsecured debt rating of
BOC. Consequently, any change in BOC's rating could lead to a corresponding change in the rating of the
bonds.

Approach: Letter of Credit backed, Insured and Guaranteed Debts published in March 2013. Please see
the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:
Any change to the foreign currency senior unsecured deposit rating of BOC could lead to a corresponding
change in the rating of the bonds.

REGULATORY DISCLOSURES

For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections
Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.

Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.

For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, this announcement provides certain
regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from
existing ratings in accordance with Moody's rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, this
announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to the rating action on the support
provider and in relation to each particular rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive rating that may be
assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction structure and
terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would have
affected the rating. For further information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.

For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit support from the primary entity(ies) of
this rating action, and whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the associated
regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. Exceptions to this approach exist for the
following disclosures, if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure to rated entity, Disclosure
from rated entity.
