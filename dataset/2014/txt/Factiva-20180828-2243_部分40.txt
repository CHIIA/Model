GINA Rinehart has bought the world’s second biggest Wagyu cattle herd outside Japan, two Dubbo farms
worth about $25m.
The acquisition of the Boogadah and Kagan properties from businessman Paul Salteri marks Mrs
Rinehart’s first investment in beef on the east coast and is the latest example of her push to capitalise on
booming Asian demand for Australian food.

Earlier this year Mrs Rinehart paid about $40 million to buy a 50 per cent stake in two vast cattle
stations in the Kimberley.
She is close to finalising the purchase of four more Kimberley cattle stations worth $65 million in a deal
that would see her end up with nearly 1.5 million hectares across Western Australia.
In a deal finalised today, a company owned by Mrs Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting bought the two
grazing properties as well as Mr Salteri’s Greenhills wagyu herd numbering about 3000 head.

A spokesman for Mrs Rinehart confirmed the deal.

“This is part of Gina Rinehart’s commitment to invest in Australian agriculture and make sure the country
is positioned to meet the demands of our northern neighbours,” he said.
Mrs Rinehart is also pursuing a $500m joint venture in Queensland’s dairy industry with plans to export
infant milk powder to China.
Her main focus remains on building the $10 billionRoy Hilliron ore mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara.
