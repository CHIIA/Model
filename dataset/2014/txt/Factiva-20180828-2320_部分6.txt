Asset sales, manufacturing closures, redundancies, offshoring production and a sell down in inventory
are all combining to make FY15 a complicated year on the earnings front for household fittings supplier
GWA Group (GWA.AU), says UBS. The broker thinks concerns raised by Australia's competition
regulator over GWA's proposed sale of its Dux hot water division to Rheem Australia may cloud the
outlook around the sale price. UBS values Dux and another business--Brivis (Heating & Cooling)--at
A$61 million combined. "While momentum in the residential market is yet to be fully reflected in GWA's
volumes, uncertainty around FY15 earnings and execution of restructuring initiatives will likely constrain
near-term share price performance," UBS says. It retains a neutral call, and A$2.55 price target. GWA
last traded at A$2.76. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

[Dow Jones] Macquarie retains an underperform rating on Port of Tauranga (POT.NZ) "as we can't get
close to the current share price on our valuation," it says. The stock closed Friday at NZ$16.30 and
Macquarie has a 12-month target price of NZ$14.50. It also noted that "nearer term, forestry export
growth is slowing and competition in the North and South Island port sectors seems to be building again
as shipping companies once again press for efficiencies and sharper port pricing."

[Dow Jones] With Australia's central bank continuing to indicate that it and the bank regulator will soon
announce new clamps to stem a rush of investor lending for mortgages, a close watch will be kept on
comments later today by one of its top officials. Luci Ellis, the head of financial stability at the RBA will
participate in panel discussion at a housing conference. The extent to which the regulators embrace
these new lending clamps will have an impact on interest rate expectations going forward.

After raising its earnings forecasts for Qantas (QAN.AU), UBS shifts to a buy recommendation from
neutral and a price target of A$2/share from A$1.50. The brokerage's EPS forecast doubles to A$0.10
from A$0.05 for fiscal 2015, rises by 33% to A$0.25 for FY16 and by 26% to A$0.27 for FY17. QAN
shares have retraced about two-third of the gains made since its results last August despite what UBS
says is evidence of positive earnings momentum. At the same time, jet fuel in AUD has fallen 10% and
the airline has confirmed a recovery in the domestic market is well under way. UBS says it also expects
rival Virgin Australia (VAH.AU) is under increasing pressure to improve profitability. QAN last traded at
A$1.425. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

Macquarie cuts its price target for Gryphon Minerals (GRY.AU) by 42% to A$0.15/share. It notes a recent
steep fall in Gryphon's stock means management will likely have to issue new shares at a lower price to
fund the equity component of developing its Banfora gold project in Burkina Faso. Macquarie also
pushes out the likely start date for development of Banfora by six months to mid-2015. "We still believe
Banfora is an achievable project although we acknowledge it is marginal at the current gold price," says
the broker, which retains an outperform call on the stock. GRY last traded at A$0.094.

2250 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian interest-rate markets will continue to trade at the mercy of offshore
events this week, with little economic news or events out locally, says CBA in a strategy note. "We
expect a mild recovery in yields (higher) this week, but highlight the significant risk of a rally around the
Fed meeting," it said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

academic member of the PBOC's monetary policy advisory committee, that China's economy should
slow to 7.2% year-on-year in 4Q from 7.3% in 3Q, but expand by 7.3% in 2015, says CBA in a strategy
note. "We maintain there are downside risks to China's GDP growth amid the authority's crackdown on
corruption and pollution," CBA said. However, Australia's exports to China should continue to make new
record highs, continuing the trend of recent years, as higher grade Australian commodity exports and
new capacity come on-stream, it adds. "We see some modest upside risks to the Australian dollar this
week, generated by some softness in the U.S. dollar and some tapering of global growth concerns as
global equity markets continue to recover," it said. The Aussie should lift to 0.8864 from US$0.8800 now.

[Dow Jones] New Zealand's central bank was already expected to be on hold for a "sustained period"
before last week's CPI result "but another very low inflation reading raises the question of whether a
deeper reappraisal is required by the central bank," says J.P.. Morgan. This week's rate review does not
include forecasts but only a short statement which "is a blessing, in that it gives (RBNZ Governor)
Wheeler flexibility," it says. He can "acknowledge that inflation is undershooting, and can state in a
roundabout way that this has implications for the rate path, without having to explicitly back down on the
view that further rate hikes are coming in 2015." Rather than using the statement to reset the policy bias
it should "use it as another opportunity to slug NZD," it says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter:

[Dow Jones] The Federal Open Market Committee meeting Wednesday is set to be the defining event of
the week. This is well expected to be the meeting where quantitative easing ends, leaving the focus on
any adjustments to the forward guidance language and potential views on the European economy, says
RBC Capital Markets in a strategy note. "We expect the Fed to err on the side of caution, which means
on forward guidance, changes should be minimal, and the key 'considerable time' phrase will likely be
kept," RBC said in a strategy note. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

[Dow Jones] The Australian dollar is beginning to work its self into a more defined range last as market
volatility has eased somewhat, says Macquarie Bank. Still, the Aussie's ability to hold above US$0.8720
last week will again begin to concern some of the less ironed-on shorts with the potential for some
stop-loss action if we can clear US$0.8840 over coming sessions. Macquarie says US$0.8900 really
needs to be broken "before we can safely say we have put in place some sort of a medium term low."
The Australian dollar is currently trading at US$0.8803. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

The profit & loss trend for Suncorp (SUN.AU) is likely to be favorable in fiscal 2015 but the company's
growth targets, particularly for general insurance, could prove a stretch, J.P. Morgan reckons. SUN
suggested at its recent annual general meeting that it had lots more in the tank, but J.P. Morgan says
that it's not so sure and needs to see evidence. Longer term, the brokerage says SUN will need to
address growth challenges in home and motor insurance posed by the rivals including Commonwealth
Bank (CBA.AU) and Westpac (WBC.AU), which are achieving better loss ratios on a like-for-like basis.
J.P. Morgan maintains a neutral recommendation, A$14.24/share target. SUN last traded at A$14.31.

[Dow Jones] New Zealand's central bank is now likely to keep rates on hold until 2Q 2015, says Barclays
economist Kieran Davies. "We still expect the RBNZ to return policy to a more neutral setting - where the
RBNZ believes the neutral cash rate is around 4.5%, but persistently low inflation suggests that the
RBNZ can stay on hold for longer than first thought, especially when it is still frustrated by the relatively
high real exchange rate," he says. Davies expects this week's rate decision to highlight both points.
