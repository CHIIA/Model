Following payment of this third installment, the company will have a balance of $12.6 million in Québec

the 2013 financial year, and $3.2 million for the first 9 months of 2014.
The company anticipates accruing approximately $1 million during the remainder of 2014, such that total
Québec Investment Tax Credits under this program as at December 31, 2014 should reach approximately
$30 million.
