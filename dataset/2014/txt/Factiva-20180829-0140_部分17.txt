Upgrades
AGL Energy ((AGK)) upgraded to Outperform from Neutral by Macquarie. B/H/S: 3/5/0

TD

AGL is now the front runner to acquireMacquarie Generation over ERM Power ((EPW)) now the Chinese
consortium has pulled out, the broker suggests. If not successful, Delta Coastal is another opportunity
which should ensure market position. Ahead of the Feb result, the broker has upgraded to Outperform.
Target rises to $16.80 from $16.70.

APA Group ((APA)) upgraded to Neutral from Underperform by BA-Merrill Lynch. B/H/S: 2/4/2

The broker has reviewed the regulated utilities sector and is now more comfortable with APA's growth
profile. Expansions in Queensland and Western Australia are expected to underpin growth. Analysis of
cash earnings since FY08 reveals returns are on an upward trajectory over a 10-year period. The rating is
upgraded to Neutral from Underperform and the price target is $6.05.
Aristocrat Leisure ((ALL)) upgraded to Buy from Neutral by UBS. B/H/S: 4/3/1
Some positive signs are emerging, in UBS' view, particularly in regard to the company's participation in
the US market, while in Australia, despite a competitive environment, products appear to be performing
strongly. The broker has upgraded to a Buy rating from Neutral, justified as Aristocrat is now trading at a
discount to the All Industrials ex Financials. The price target is raised to $5.20 from $4.50.
Atlas Iron ((AGO)) upgraded to Neutral from Sell by Citi and to Hold from Sell by Deutsche Bank. B/H/S:
2/6/0

Production and shipments were strong in the December quarter and earnings guidance ahead of Citi's
estimates. Capex for the next stage of growth remains a key concern for the broker. The upgrades to
earnings and valuation mean an increase in the target price to $1.10 from 90c. The broker upgrades the
recommendation to Neutral from Sell. Deutsche Bank thinks the company has been clever in lifting FY14
sales guidance by using lower grade material. The broker also notes some modest savings have been
identified at Mt Webber and this is a key driver of the valuation uplift. The next catalyst is the long-awaited
rail access agreement. The rating is upgraded to Hold from Sell and the price target is raised to $1.05 from
90c.
Boral ((BLD)) upgraded to Neutral from Underperform by Credit Suisse. B/H/S: 2/1/4

Credit Suisse has upgraded to Neutral from Underperform following Boral's trading update. The broker has
increased FY14 earnings forecasts by 7%. Credit Suisse sees the company making good progress on
controlling the controllables -reducing overheads, simplifying the structure and conserving capital. The
broker considers operational and macro concerns are now reflected in the share price and the value is
better on a risk/reward basis.
Fletcher Building ((FBU)) upgraded to Neutral from Underweight by JP Morgan. B/H/S: 3/3/2

Page37of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The broker now expects the residential and non-residential upswing in New Zealand to persist for longer.
Moderate short-term earnings downgrades are made but long-term there's a rise in forecast cash flow and
JP Morgan has upgraded the price target to NZ$8.50 from NZ$8.00. The recommendation is upgraded to
Neutral from Underweight.
Fortescue Metals ((FMG)) upgraded to Buy from Neutral by Citi. B/H/S: 7/0/1

The December quarter was below the broker's estimates because of cyclone activity but costs were better
than expected and, combined with the Australian dollar depreciation, has driven earnings upgrades. On the
back of a share price correction Citi has upgraded the rating to Buy from Neutral and the target to $6.70
from $6.40.
Goodman Group ((GMG)) upgraded to Outperform from Neutral by Macquarie. B/H/S: 3/3/1

Macquarie considers the backdrop is favourable for investment flows and the lower Australian dollar
provides a filip, with a positive translation benefit. Conversion of industrial sites to higher and better use
provides another tailwind, in the broker's opinion. The company's global diversity underpins a growing
development pipeline and the broker has upgraded to Outperform from Neutral. The price target of $4.98 is
retained.
Insurance Australia ((IAG)) upgraded to Neutral from Sell by UBS. B/H/S: 1/6/1 UBS has updated
forecasts following lifting of research restrictions. The broker estimates the proposed transaction with
Wesfarmers ((WES)) to be neutral for FY15 earnings and boost FY16 by 6.3%. The rating is upgraded to
Neutral from Sell, given the recent underperformance. IAG in the latest update provided no details of why
the GWP range had been ratcheted down by 2%. UBS thinks a small contributor could be the need to
make refunds in the personal lines segment in Victoria. A refund is required to be paid to customers for not
passing on full benefit of lower  premiums from July 1 2013. UBS believes the issue must be dealt with
carefully in an environment where growth is slowing and market share needs to be protected. Origin
Energy ((ORG)) upgraded to Overweight from Neutral by JP Morgan. B/H/S: 4/4/0 Origin's earnings are
expected to recover through FY15 and FY16 while fears surrounding APLNG's capital requirements have
diminished, according to JP Morgan. The broker has re-set timing to capture first gas in late 2015. This
accounts for a large portion of the revision in the target price, raised to $16.15 from $14.40. The rating is
upgraded to Overweight from Neutral.
Regis Resources ((RRL)) upgraded to Buy from Neutral by UBS. B/H/S: 1/4/2
Despite the company lowering the life of mine production profile at Garden Well the broker's valuation for
the company has increased because of the recent lift to long-term gold price assumptions. Regis remains
one of the lowest cost producers in the Australian gold sector. UBS believes the company has the ability
to maintain a healthy dividend stream. The rating is raised to Buy from Neutral and the price target is
steady at $3.30.
Roc Oil ((ROC)) upgraded to Overweight from Neutral by JP Morgan. B/H/S: 4/0/0

After the fourth quarter exceeded expectations JP Morgan is upgrading the recommendation to Overweight
from Neutral. The broker expects a solid operating cash flow in the year ahead and the expected FID on
the phase 1 of the Malaysian RSC project this half should act as a positive catalyst. The price target is
raised to 61c from 54c.
The Reject Shop ((TRS)) upgraded to Neutral from Underperform by Credit Suisse. B/H/S: 0/3/0
Credit Suisse suggests the valuation has become more appropriate following the company's shock profit
announcement and the subsequent sell-off. Price target loses 20c to $13.50. Rating moves to Neutral from
Underperform. CS analysts are pointing the finger at an increasingly more competitive environment that
seems to be hurting the company in traditional hard goods categories. Estimates have been slashed.

Western Areas ((WSA)) upgraded to Buy from Neutral by UBS. B/H/S: 4/2/0

December quarter production of contained nickel was down 3% but ahead of the broker's forecasts. The
company expects to update guidance at the half year result. UBS has raised the 2014 nickel price forecast
but lowered the 2015 and 2016 price forecasts. Offsetting some of this decline is an average 3% reduction
to the Australian dollar for 2014-2015. The net impact is an increase in FY14 earnings forecasts by 20%.
The rating is upgraded to Buy from Neutral. The broker thinks recent investor concerns over debt have
been overstated. Under current price assumptions the broker expects Western Areas to have sufficient
liquidity to repay the July 2015 convertible bond.

Page38of307©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Westfield Group ((WDC)) upgraded to Outperform from Underperform by Macquarie. B/H/S: 2/4/0
The broker considers the company's poor share price performance has resulted in an improved value
proposition. The exposure to a recovery in the US market and leverage to a depreciating Australian dollar
bodes well for Westfield in Macquarie's view. The rating is upgraded to Outperform from Underperform and
the price target is reduced to $10.72 from $11.12. Earnings growth appears subdued, but Macquarie
considers the stock is approaching a point where earnings growth will accelerate. The Scentre proposal is
not yet a done deal and, while it makes strategic sense, Macquarie thinks the price is too high. The broker
suspects the proposal's metrics may change ahead of the shareholder vote in May.

Downgrades
AGL Energy ((AGK)) downgraded to Neutral from Overweight by JP Morgan. B/H/S: 3/5/0
At the right price, acquisition of MacGen, or part thereof, should enable AGL to strike a balance between
the drag on near-term earnings and longer-term value creation, in the broker's opinion. In the meantime,
the focus is on the falling away of the Loy Yang A compensation. The broker envisages gas sales are
unlikely to bridge the gap from falling compensation. The FY15 earnings forecast is lowered and the price
target is reduced to $16.40 from $16.90. The rating is also downgraded, to Neutral from Overweight.

See also AGK upgrade.
Drillsearch Energy ((DLS)) downgraded to Neutral from Overweight by JP Morgan and to Neutral from
Buy by UBS. B/H/S: 2/2/0

Drillsearch has increased production guidance by 30% and now beat expectations over two strong
quarters. JP Morgan continues to like the strategy and asset mix but believes there are better options on a
valuation basis, such as Senex Energy ((SXY)). The broker thinks it's time for the share price to take a
breather. December quarter production was 30% ahead of UBS estimates, driving a 28% rise in sales
revenue, quarter on quarter. The company has increased production guidance but UBS was surprised at
the size of the increase. A reserves upgrade is expected to follow. The broker likes the performance of
Bauer but thinks the share price adequately captures the upside. Hence, after a 21% rally over the past
three months, the rating is downgraded to Neutral from Buy.
Forge Group ((FGE)) downgraded to Sell from Neutral by Citi. B/H/S: 0/1/2

Forge has materially downgraded expectations just two weeks after confirming FY14 guidance. The
company now forecasts an EBITDA loss of $20-25m. Citi thinks this poor visibility is because of weak
reporting systems as well as a function of industry-wide margin pressure, project losses and focus on cash
flow rather than profitability. Citi suspects another dilutive equity raising is on the cards. The broker does
not think the stock is investment grade and has downgraded to Sell/High Risk from Neutral. Citi thinks
there is continuing risk to underlying earnings given the damage to reputation in the Perth market. The
price target is reduced to 60c from $1.10.
ResMed ((RMD)) downgraded to Hold from Outperform by CIMB Securities. B/H/S: 4/4/0

Earnings for the second quarter were below CIMB's expectations while pricing continued to be affected by
competition. In the broker's view it is not clear if the competitive bidding is a "distraction" and can be
addressed or whether there is more damage in the pricing/volume dynamic. CIMB expects ResMed is well
placed to offset the pressures but suspects the stock will be volatile over the short to medium term. The
price target is lowered to $5.40 from $6.44 and moves to a Hold rating pending greater visibility on
earnings.
SP AusNet ((SPN)) downgraded to Underperform from Neutral by BA-Merrill Lynch. B/H/S: 2/2/2

The broker is downgrading the rating to Underperform from Neutral, citing lower total returns. Merrills finds
the stock is underperforming with a distribution yield of 7% and 5-year compound growth rate of just 1.5%
based on forecasts. The broker does not think the stock is particularly cheap versus history and, while this
trait may be common at present in the sector, it does confirm the view that the stock will underperform its
peers.
The Reject Shop ((TRS)) downgraded to Neutral from Buy by UBS. B/H/S: 0/3/0
The company grew first half sales by 18% but like-for-like was flat, softer than budgeted in the lead up to
Christmas. UBS estimates that the earning contribution per established store has been in decline since the
second half of 2012. The reasons given centre on the fact that new stores are smaller than average but
UBS thinks investors need more assurance that this is not a deeper problem. In the interim, the broker is
downgrading to Neutral from Buy. The price target is reduced to $12.30 from $18.20.

Treasury Wine Estates ((TWE)) downgraded to Neutral from Outperform by Macquarie. B/H/S: 1/3/4
Treasury Wine yesterday cut its FY14 guidance by 17% based on weaker sales in Australia and a
slowdown in China and the broker does not see conditions improving in the near term. The broker has also
replaced its TWE analyst, pulling its rating back to Neutral pending a full review of the numbers. Target
falls to $4.00 from $5.75.
