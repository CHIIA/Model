Burcher Property Group has sold has a corner office building in the Sydney central business
district to a local private Chinese investor for $45 million.
It is the buyer's first major commercial investment in Australia. The sale price reflected a yield of
6.65 per cent and the building provides a net income of about $3 million. The fully-leased, 12-level
building at 299 Elizabeth Street, is on a prominent corner opposite Hyde Park.

John Bowie Wilson and Richard Garland of Knight Frank and Scott Gray-Spencer of CBRE worked
for the vendor.

"This illustrates that for well-leased and well-located properties, cap rates are going to continue to
come down," Mr Bowie Wilson said."People view the interest rate environment as stable and are
prepared to pay a premium to get in the market because stock is so tightly held."

The building has a net lettable area of 5974 square metres, which includes 375 square metres of
ground floor retail. It has a weighted average lease expiry of just over three years.
