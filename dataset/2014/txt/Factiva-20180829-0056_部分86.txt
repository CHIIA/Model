A continued rally in Telstra, a warm reception to Woodside Petroleum's decision to pull the plug on an
Israeli joint venture and international interest in beleaguered Treasury Wine Estates pushed the
sharemarket marginally higher.

The market recovered from early losses sparked by another drop in the iron ore price and a slump in
consumer confidence to close flat.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index edged up 4.2 points, or a bit less than 0.1 per cent, to 5419.7, while the All
Ordinaries Index added 2.2 points to 5403.9.
Local shares took a weak lead from offshore after big markets in the US and Europe finished lower on
Tuesday night. Asian sharemarkets were mixed in the afternoon session.

Domestically, investor sentiment was subdued amid further evidence consumer confidence is at a
more than 2-year low. The monthly Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of sentiment slumped 6.8 per
cent to 92.9 points in May, down from 99.7 in April.

"The sharp fall indicates an unfavourable response to the federal budget," Westpac chief economist
Bill Evans said.

Meanwhile, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed wages grew 0.7 per cent over the March
quarter. Wages are up 2.6 per cent over the past year.

The big four banks were mixed. Westpac sank 1¢ to $33.67, and National Australia Bank fell 0.2 per
cent to $33.05. Commonwealth Bank added 0.5 per cent to $80.19, while ANZ rose 0.9 per cent to
$33.03.
Mining stocks tumbled as the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, slipped another 1 per cent to
$US97.50 a tonne - its lowest price since September 2012.
The country's biggest producer of iron ore, Rio Tinto, lost 1.1 per cent to a near nine-month low of
$59.40. BHP Billiton shed 0.8 per cent to $37.17, while the third-largest local iron ore miner,
Fortescue Metals Group, fell 2.4 per cent to $4.43.

Woodside rose 0.8 per cent to $41.23, with investors now expecting a capital return after the
company terminated its agreement to take a stake in a $US2.7 billion natural gas project in Israel.
Treasury Wine Estates was the best-performing stock in the S&P/ASX 200 as it continued to get a
boost from Tuesday's revelation the company rejected a private equity takeover bid last month, with
Chicago-based investment firm Harris Associates emerging as a new significant shareholder.
