The Platts daily Australian alumina assessment rose $2 to $340/mt on September 19, marking a week
of hefty gains, with the assessment up $7/mt from the end of last week, on China's seasonal stock
building during the fourth quarter and high Chinese domestic prices.

The Australian assessment is also up $22.50/mt from a month ago.

Chinese consumers were spooked by Chalco's unplanned refining cut this week in Henan province,
sparked by problems at a red mud dam. But on September 19 a Chalco source told Platts the repairs
were nearly complete and refining operations may be able to resume next week. The 2.4 million
mt/year unit was operating at 2 million mt/year before its curtailment, and is expected to lose
50,000-100,000 mt of output, the source said.
On September 19, alumina buying interest was around $360/mt, CIF China, with selling interest at
$365-370/mt. On September 12 the bid-offer spread was $350-360/mt CIF. Lately price discussions in
Asia have mostly been in CIF China terms rather than FOB Australia, as participants look to Chinese
domestic prices as key indicators. As a guide, FOB Australia bid-offer levels centered around
$338-343/mt on September 19.
A steep run-up in Chinese domestic alumina prices in the last month has made Australian material
cheaper in import parity terms.

As in previous weeks and months, market participants continued to note that there remains a global
surplus of alumina, as smelting cuts are not being matched with refining cuts. They said alumina offers
have been harder to come by only because sellers have been deferring as they wait for higher prices.

However, a Western producer was heard to have quietly put an Australian cargo on the market on
September 19 for shipment in November or December. The seller did not give price guidance, a
prospective buyer said.
Earlier in the week, a producer reported the sale of a 30,000 mt Western Australian parcel at $340/mt
FOB, paymennt 10 days after documents, for shipment in mid-November.
The Platts daily ex-works Henan alumina price assessment at Yuan 2,770/mt ($451/mt) for 70:30 cash
and credit payment terms, on September 19, was up Yuan 40/mt, as market sentiment stayed strong on
tighter spot availability.

The latest assessment is up Yuan 130/mt from a week ago and up Yuan 300/mt from this time last
month.
