Japan IP down 3.3% in June, expected to rise in coming months

Reuters reports Japan's industrial output fell 3.3 percent in June as companies curbed production due to a
pile-up in inventories, government data showed on Wednesday, but manufacturers expect output to rise in
the coming months.

The month-on-month fall compared with economists' median estimate of a 1.2 percent decline in a
Reuters poll of economists. It followed a 0.7 percent increase in May, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry data showed.

Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 2.5 percent in July and increase 1.1 percent
in August, the data showed. The ministry lowered its assessment of factory output, saying it has
weakened.

*Our market has seen a welcome burst of optimism, with the rising tide lifting all ships this morning.

The rise may have been inspired by a rush into equities on newspaper speculation that the RBA may cut
rates next Tuesday - also ahead of the profit reporting season and following encouraging company news
so far - as well as on 'safe haven" buying with China holding up and troubles in many regions. All sectors
have gained, and the market is at a new post 2007 high (the market hit an all time record high of 67828.7
on November 1 2007).

"Down slightly .. close probably dictated by Asia"

"Bernborough said, "I'll call it down slightly, giving back yesterday's rally, with the close probably dictated
by Asia. I have no strong view at present. Down about 6 on the day".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 11 points to 5588.4 last evening.

*CPU: UK Govt decision means CPU's CVS biz will enter into rundown in 2016

Computershare Ltd announced it has today received notice that the UK Government has concluded its
consultation process on the provision of childcare accounts within the new UK tax free childcare scheme.
The scheme is scheduled to commence in the second half of calendar year 2015.

The UK government has determined that National Savings and Investments, a government agency will be
the Scheme's account provider, working in partnership with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.
This will not impact CPU's UK based Voucher Services business (CVS) in 2015. However it is now
expected that the CVS will move into run off mode in full year 2016 and is expected to progressively wind

Page24of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.down over the subsequent two years. The CVSbusiness has in recent years contributed in the range of
2/3% of CPU's consolidated EBITDA.

An update will be provided at CPU's full year results released on August 13 on the potential implications
of this development on the carrying value of goodwill associated with the CVSbusiness, which is
approximately $US130 million.

CPU President and CEO Stuart Irving said, "While we have previously flagged the regulatory risk
associated with our CVSbusiness, we are naturally disappointed by today's announcement by the UK
government".

profit after tax of $133.1 million.

investment portfolio. "With bond yields having come down during the half, we are expecting it to book an
unrealised gain of around $27 million pre tax".

share for 650 million shares on issue, with the rest retained by the US parent company. Goldman Sachs

Major Banks accounted for 78% of residential mortgage loans outstanding as at December 31 2013..

forma net profit after tax of $179 million and underlying NPAT of $221 million in full year 2013"..

Progen Pharmaceuticals Ltd announced PI-88 licensee Medigen Biotechnology Corp is continuing PI-88's
Phase III PATRON clinical trial for PI-88.

While results of the interim analysis carried out on the Phase III clinical trial indicated it did not meet the
primary endpoint of Disease Free Survival and that further analysis by an independent medical imaging
company in the US, BioClinica will be conducted by the end of the year and will be an important
reference for the efficacy of PI-88.

While the interim analysis conducted on July 27 mainly analysed the primary endpoint of Disease Free
Survival the final analysis will analyse all of the efficacy endpoints including Disease Free Survival, time to
recurrence, tumor recurrence rate and overall survival.

Both the interim and final analysis use the two tailed P-value to determine statistical difference between
the treatment and placebo groups. The smaller the P-value the more significant the difference. The interim
analysis was based on only 60% of available data and therefore the P-value was set very low at 0.01806.
the final analysis will be conducted on the data from the total targeted recurrent 218 patients, with the
statistical significant difference set at a P-value of 0.04148. (Jul 29)
