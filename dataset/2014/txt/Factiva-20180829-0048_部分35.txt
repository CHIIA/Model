The Australian property developer wants to achieve balance in its projects by offering units that appeal
to both local and overseas markets
Australian property group Crown International Holdings Group opened an office in Singapore on May
27. The office at Suntec Tower Two will serve to extend the groupâ€™s reach beyond Singapore to
neighbouring countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines. This will be Crown Groupâ€™s third
regional office, following the opening of the first in Jakarta and second in Surabaya, Indonesia last year.

Mainland Chinese buyers are the biggest group of foreign buyers in Australia today. Thus, the regional
offices were established to further expand the base of foreign buyers from Indonesia, Malaysia and
Singapore, says Iwan Sunito, CEO of Crown Group, who was in Singapore for the launch of the new
office.

The opening of Crown Groupâ€™s office in the city-state came a week after the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) warned investors of the risks involved in investing in overseas properties, particularly
since rules and regulations governing foreign investors are different from those of Singapore, and that
there may be no safeguards to protect their interests. Singaporeans are said to have poured $2 billion
into foreign real estate last year, a 43% jump from $1.4 billion in 2012. The top three markets were
Malaysia, Australia and the UK.

The recommendations by MAS are both necessary and timely, says Sunito. â€œForeign investors tend
to overlook some factors when buying properties overseas, he concedes. â€œIn particular, they need to
look at who they are buying from, and whether the developer has a long-term presence and interest in
the market. For instance, even in Australia, there are some new developers that have no capacity or
track record to undertake big developments, so foreign buyers should always do their homework and find
out the background of the developers if they do not want to suffer from buyersâ€™ remorse, he warns.
The increase in overseas property investment by Singaporeans is partly due to the punitive government
property cooling measures back home. Likewise, developers from Singapore have ventured abroad for
the same reasons. Australia has been a favourite destination for both investors and developers, as it
presents many more investment options, without the same restrictions in Singapore, says a property
consultant.
Singapore property groups that have been active in Australia include Frasers Centrepoint, which early
this month put in a bid of A$2.6 billion ($3.1 billion) for Australand Property Group. Frasers Centrepoint
also has a large mixed-use development in Sydney called Central Park, a redevelopment of the former
Carlton & United Breweriessite. Another Singapore developer that has been active in Australia over the
past two years is Far East Organization, which purchased the Ausgrid Tower on George Street in
Sydney for A$151.8 million in March, bringing its total purchases in Australia to more than A$1 billion.
Other Singapore-listed developers that have made inroads into Australia in recent years include Aspial
Corp, Hiap Hoe, Ho Bee Land and Sim Lian Group.
Mainland Chinese developers such as Shanghai-based Greenland Group have also been very
aggressive. In April, Greenland purchased two new projects in Sydney, in addition to an existing
development in Sydney and a development in Melbourne acquired last year, bringing the total value of
acquisitions to about A$1.5 billion. Last December, it launched its first phase of 300 units at Greenland

released in Hong Kong and Singapore were snapped up, and mainland Chinese buyers are said to
have accounted for the majority of the sales. All 300 units in the first phase have been sold, and the
second phase of 200 apartments was launched in April.

Strong competition driving up prices

Sunito notes that there are still many development opportunities in Sydney, even if local developers such
as Crown Group face stiffer competition from overseas developers, especially from China and
Singapore in recent years. â€œItâ€™s not difficult to find sites in Sydney, but land prices are quite high
at the moment and there is a danger of these new players coming in and buying at the top of the
[market], and this could prove quite risky, he cautions.
As for Crown Group, Sunito maintains that they will purchase only sites that are close to transport nodes
and shopping centres, and where there is a good balance between local and foreign demand.

Some foreign developers may launch projects that see strong interest from overseas buyers but may not
appeal to the domestic market. The only concern about such projects is when it comes to reselling, says
Sunito. In Australia, foreign buyers may purchase residential property directly from developers in the
primary market, in either off-plan or completed projects. When it comes to reselling, however, they are
allowed to sell only to Australian citizens or permanent residents. â€œThe risk is that the owners may
face difficulty in finding a buyer for their units in the resale market, if units do not fit local homebuyersâ€™
taste, he says. And if many of the buyers are foreign investors, it could affect pricing in the secondary
market if many units are offered for sale, he explains.

To safeguard buyersâ€™ investment and protect the prices of its developments in the secondary market,
Crown Group ensures that foreigners make up not more than 30% of the buyers of its projects. â€œWe
do not sell an entire development to foreign buyers because projects that have strong local support are
less likely to experience big price fluctuations in the secondary market, he says.

Prices in Sydney are said to have risen 14.5% since 2013, with gross rental yields in the 5% range.
However, net yields are closer to 3%. The rise in prices can be attributed to several factors, including
strong local investment demand, Asian parents buying property for their childrenâ€™s further education,
and migrants from Asia who â€œlove investing in property he adds. â€œNew South Wales is currently
home to the largest immigrant popuÂlation in Australia.

Migrants

Sunito himself is a migrant who is now an Australian citizen. Originally from Surabaya, he moved to
Sydney in 1984 for his high school education and went on to complete a Bachelor of Architecture and
Master of Construction of Management at The University of New South Wales. He co-founded Crown
Group with fellow Indonesian, Paul Sathio. The two friends lived in a tight-knit Indonesian community in
Sydney. Sathio, who grew up in Sydney, even won second place in Adelaideâ€™s junior badminton
championship one year.
Crown Group was founded as a 50:50 partnership between the two friends in 1996. Sunito assumed the
role of architect and concept designer, along with overseeing project marketing. Meanwhile, Sathio, a
civil engineer and builder by training, focused on the more technical aspects of development and
construction.

Sunito says Sydney is a choice destination for Indonesian students. â€œThere are more Indonesians
living in Sydney than in Los Angeles, another popular city among Indonesian students looking to further
their studies
Indonesians investing in overseas property have traditionally favoured London, Singapore and Sydney.
In terms of price point, however, Sydney remains the most affordable. In the Sydney CBD, an apartment
costs around A$10,000 psm (A$929 psf), says Sunito, whereas in Singapore, the average price of prime
condos is $1,645 psf, and in prime Central London, the average sale price is Â£1,503 psf.
â€œPricewise, Sydney looks cheap, he adds.
Since its inception 18 years ago, the partners at Crown Group had decided they would focus on
developing projects within a 30km radius of the Sydney CBD, an area they know well. The partnersâ€™
maiden project was a 10-storey, 54-apartment block with retail units on the ground floor. Located at
Bondi Junction, the project is said to be worth A$28 million today.
The group has a portfolio of developments worth A$3.5 billion, including both completed projects and
those under construction. â€œOur goal is to build a A$10 billion pipeline, says Sunito. This year, the
group intends to roll out A$1 billion worth of residential projects in Sydney.

Page86of295©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Its latest project, called Top Ryde City Living, was recently awarded the Urban Development Institute of
Australia (UDIA) New South Wales Presidentâ€™s Award under the â€œBest High Density
Development category. The A$500 million resort-style development with seven blocks comprising a total
of 653 apartments is located in Ryde, near the Sydney Olympic Park and Macquarie University.

Top Ryde City Living was launched and completed in phases. Construction began in 2011 and 500
residents have moved in. The final phase of the project, called Viva by Crown, was launched for sale last
September and is scheduled for completion in August. Viva by Crown has a total of 166 one- to
three-bedroom apartments, of which only 45 are available for sale. Asking prices are said to be between
A$633,000 and A$935,000.

Projects in the pipeline
The group is currently working on a A$250 million freehold residential project on Clarence Street
located in the heart of the Sydney CBD. The 25-storey tower, called Sydney by Crown, will have a curved
steel roof feature and will be designed by Koichi Takada Architects, which also designed Crown
Groupâ€™s other iconic towers, such as the 20-storey Infinity by Crown at Green Square and Skye by
Crown in North Sydney. The Sydney by Crown development will feature a pedestrian laneway with 11
new cafÃ©s, restaurants and retail outlets. A total of 220 apartments as well as five-star serviced
apartments will occupy the upper levels of the complex. The units will be a mix of one- to three-bedroom
apartments and penthouses. Construction is expected to commence in mid-2014 and prices of the
project have yet to be fixed.

Sunito believes Sydney continues to be an attractive investment opportunity for buyers, as it has some of
the strongest fundamentals in Australia. There has also been a shift in demand based on demographic
trends, with the older population looking to downsize, and therefore moving closer to amenities and
transport hubs. Meanwhile, their grown-up children who want to live on their own prefer to live either near
their workplace or entertainment spots.

This shift has contributed to an increase in demand for housing that has outstripped supply. Thus, Sunito
reckons, there is a shortage of some 50,000 housing units in Sydney alone. In addition, only about
20,000 of an annual target of 31,000 homes are being built each year, exacerbating the housing
shortage, he adds. â€œIf we assume A$800,000 per housing unit, weâ€™re looking at a shortage of
about A$40 billion worth of homes.
To expand beyond Sydney, Crown Group is looking towards Melbourne, where Sunito is in the midst of
establishing a joint venture to acquire a large site in Melbourne CBD. This joint venture will be Crown
Groupâ€™s first project outside Sydney. â€œWe will still be focused on Sydney, but we believe that
having a property in Melbourne will help us in establishing Crown Group as a brand. The location we
have in Melbourne CBD will help us differentiate ourselves from other projects there, he says.
