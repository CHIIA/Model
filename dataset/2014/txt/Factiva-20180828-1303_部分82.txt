While in Europe, the UK and the US, markets head into the summer holiday break, with some locking in of
profits ahead of going on leave, in Australia, we are heading into the profit reporting season, with investors

"Down, but not a hi conviction call .. high 5530, low 5480, close down 10"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract pointing down 8 points.

"US equities printed lower lows overnight (before closing slightly higher) with the exception of the
small-cap Russell 2000.
"Junk bonds have also managed to hold up over the past few sessions, suggesting a bottom, if only of a
short-term nature, is close at hand for equities in terms of time.

"A general rule of thumb I run with is that five successive closes in either direction is indicative of a trend
in that direction so it will be very interesting to see how we close today.

"I am guessing down but it is not a high-conviction call. The high will be 5530. The low will be 5480. When
the dust has settled, the market will have closed at 5502, down 10 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 6.6 points to 5512 last evening.

*BWP: NPAT up 34.8%, distrib was 7.88c, DRP was avail/outlook cautious
BWP Trust for the year ended June 30 announced a net profit up 34.8% to $149.081 million on revenue
up 16.7% to $127.426 million.

NTA backing per security is $2.07 vs $1.93 last year.

A final distribution of 7.88c was announced, record date was June 30. The DRP was available.

NTA backing per security is $2.07 vs $1.93 last year.

Gearing is at 24.4% vs 21.2% last year.

Weighted average lease expiry is 6.9 years vs 6.8 years last year.

During the year a portfolio of 10 Bunnings Warehouse were acquired and five were divested in separate
transactions.

The Trust pays out 100% of distributable profit each period in accordance with the requirement of its
constitution.

Outlook
BWP said the level of income growth the Trust derives from market rent reviews will depend on property
specific factors. Some retailing sectors are still experiencing soft trading which is likely to put ongoing
pressure on market rental levels for these sectors. Bunnings is developing most of its roll out of new stors,
giving it greater control over commencing rents through sale and lease back transactions than it would
have through lease deals with third party developers.

These factors may result in more moderate market rental growth for the Trust vs prior years.

Analysts expectations: $91.9mln, div 7.8c/$88.7 mln.

Page208of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On July 28 a leading broker retained a 'sell" on BWP Trust with a price target of $2.13. The broker said it
will look for colour on the 22 market rent reviews due to be conducted in 2nd half 2014 and their impact on
earnings. Also it notes 17 market rent reviews remain unresolved during 2013 and first half 2014. Given
the nature of the arbitration process they are all unlikely to be resolved by this result and may potentially
be pushed out to future periods.

The broker said with 214 slated to be a big year in terms of the number of market rent reviews, it remains
cognisant that acquisitions may dilute the impact market reviews have on the REIT's earnings profile. It
added that BWP has made a number of portfolio acquisitions during the year.

BWP down 2 cents to $2.49

*DUE: Recontracts with more than 85% of shippers ahead of 2016 tariff
DUET Group announced DBP has reached agreement to recontract with shippers representing most of
its firm full haul capacity under its Standard Shipper Contracts. DBP will now have tariff certainty for more
than 85% of its aggregate firm full haul contracted capacity including Alcoa's exempt contract. This
means that less than 15% of DBP's firm full haul contracted capacity will now be subject to the 2016
regulatory tariff determination.

As part of the agreement some of DBP's shippers have brought forward a portion oft heir relinquishment
rights. As a result DBP's aggregate contracted capacity from July 1 2014 will be 58TJ/day lower, around
7% of previous firm full haul contracted capacity.

DUET's CEO David Bartholomew said in the report it was a positive outcome for DBP. Recontracting
reinforces DBP's strong long term shipper relationships and recontracting ahead oft he 2016 regulatory
tariff determination was compelling for both parties.

treat patients with advanced heart failure requiring an implantable left ventricular assist device to maintain

The company has agreed to acquire ACTTAB subject to regulatory approvals.

Refinancing of bond maturities was completed on May 1 resulting in interest savings of approximately $10
millon per annum.

Managing director and CEO David Attenborough said in the report the strong result illustrates the benefits
of being diversified across four businesses, with market leading brands and a unique milti product, multi
channel distribution model.

Guidance

Mr Attenborough said Tabcorp is well placed to drive profitable growth through its diversified portfolio of
businesses, while maintaining expense discipline. Following the integration of ACTTAB the group expects
a Return on Invested Capital of 14%.

Analysts expectations: $144.9 mln, div 7.8c/$146.1 mln/$132.4 mln.

Page212of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Following TABCorp's announcement that the Appeal Court had ruled against Tabcorp in the Health Levy
case, one leading broker with a "reduce" on TABCorp and an unchanged price target of $2.70 said the
ruling will reduce full year 2014 NPAT by $19 million or 15% of the broker's forecast NPAT. The broker
said while this will be treated as a one off, it is yet another negative development following the ruling on
the gaming machine licences last week and the recent hikes in race fields.

The broker also expected the newsflow on the stock to remain negative on the wagering side as the retail
channel and tote product continues to decline and the market shifts towards online and fixed odds where
the more sophisticated new entrants have significant competitive advantage.

*Another leading broker with a 'sell" on TABCorp and a price target of $3.20 said it expects continued
migration away from tote betting to fixed odds. The 4th quarter 2014 will be boosted by World Cup
turnover, which may also have a cost impact, given that increased online competition saw gambling and
spend up 14.5% in 2nd half 2014.
The broker excluded the $19 million one off after tax charge relating to the Victorian Gaming Machine
Levy from its NPAT forecast (of $146.1 million).

Leading brokers with 'sell" and "reduce" ratings on Tabcorp had price targets of $3.20 and $2.70
respectively, both unchanged.
Following TABCorp's to acquire ACT TAB for $105.5 mln
*One leading broker said while the transaction appears to be a logical bolt on, if completed it would
increase TAH's tote exposure which is being eroded by online corporate bookmakers.

*The other leading broker said while the licence is attractive, and the multiple is well below where Tabcorp
is currently trading, the market is clearly shifting from retail to online/mobile and from to tote to fixed odds.
"This is even more critical, in our view, as the sophisticated online operators (Sportsbet, William Hill,
bet365) continue to grow their active player base .. through better pricing (40%) product and platform".

*The Financial Times reported as of Aug 01, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 20 polled investment
analysts covering Tabcorp Holdings Limited advises investors to hold their position in the company. This
has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts deteriorated on Jan 22,
2014. The previous consensus forecast advised that Tabcorp Holdings Limited would outperform the
market. There were 4 buys, 4 outperforms, 6 holds, 4 underperforms and 1 sell.

*WOW: ACCC will not oppose acquisition of Hudson Bldg by WOW/Lowe's

Woolworths Ltd announced the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission announced it will not
oppose the proposed acquisition of Hudson Building Supplies Pty Ltd by Woolworths Ltd and Lowe's
Companies Inc.

Hudson operates a chain of stores in NSW and Queensland that supply building supplies, hardware and
home improvement products. While the ACCC found the degree of overlap in the supply of products and
services to smaller trade customers is limited, it also found the j/v would be likely to be competitively
constrained by retail competitors in each of the relevant local markets following the proposed acquisition.

copper, an increased dividend, and overall cost reductions, and negative surprise potential if the dividend

247.3% to $2.267 million.

No final dividend is proposed.

NTA backing is 4.4c vs 6.6c last year.

EPS was negative 2.3c.

Tidewater chairman Paul Young and managing director Andrew Brown said in the report while 2014 has
been disappointing for Tidewater in a financial sense, the majority of the loss recorded was a result of the
divestment of the group's stake in Adelaide Resources at an average price of just over 6c per share vs
9.5c the previous year, despite ADN achieving some excellent drilling results over the past 12 months.
"With many other smaller expLoration companies sitting on low cash reserves, we suspect it may be some
time - absent a spectacular exploration result - before improved prices for such entities are seen".
Late in 2013, the company met with James Jackson who put forward a number of interesting investment
ideas in the agriculture and agricultural infrastructure sectors.
As a result the company made an initial investment in Namoi Cotton Cooperative which trades at below
one third of its stated net asset backing.
Subsequently James joined the board and will present an outline of his and the board's renewed
objectives and strategies at the upcoming AGM".

per share after the 10 for 1 consolidation. (Aug 6)

Outlook
Managing director Jim Sturgess said in the report the company's diversity helped it achieve robust growth
in 2014 and while it endured some setbacks with a few contracts delayed or cancelled, it was generally
happy with the progress made.
The group starts the new year with solid foundations and expects continued profit growth and business
expansion during 2015.

Analysts expectations: $11.6 mln, div 7c.

*On July 14 a leading broker following Titan's unaudited full year 2014 result announcement indicated that
EBIT is at $18.5 million, 5.6% behind guidance due to the delay in a Camp Contract (water, waste and
catering) that had been scheduled to be mobilised in May. While this is disappointing for 2014, it does
drag earnings into full year 2015 which is a positive, the broker said.

The broker added while it believes the outlook in Queensland remains strong with 1300 wells needing to
be drilled annually, the company's decision to drive interstate expansion is a positive and demonstrates
TTN's ability to transfer its skill sets across varied geographies. The company retained an "add" on Titan
but lowered its price target to $2.57 from $2.64.
Company guidance: On July 10 Titan Energy Services Ltd announced it expects EBIT in the order of
$18.5 m for the year to end June, up above the $14.5m EBIT for 2013 but lower than the targeted range
for 2014 of $19.5/21m.
