Investors focused on Australia Tuesday even as trading remained thin as the region's bourses closed for
public holidays in Japan, Hong Kong, and Seoul. The Shanghai Composite ended unchanged while the
Sensex was up 0.3%. The All Ordinaries added 0.4%.

Earlier Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia expectedly held interest rates at its existing record-low of
2.5% with few changes in the accompanying statements of RBA Governor Glenn Stevens.
