Final result of Danfoss’s tender offer for all the shares in Vacon

The offer period under the voluntary public tender offer by Oy Danfoss Ab (the ‘Offeror’), a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of Danfoss A/S, to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares in Vacon Plc
(‘Vacon’) that are not held by the Offeror or Vacon or its subsidiaries (the ‘Tender Offer’) expired on 21
November 2014 at 4:00 pm (Finnish time).

According to the final result of the Tender Offer, the shares tendered in the Tender Offer represent
approximately 85.74 per cent of all the shares and voting rights in Vacon. The tendered shares, together
with the shares that the Offeror has purchased from AC Invest Three B.V., increase the Offeror’s
ownership to approximately 96.30 per cent of all the shares and voting rights in Vacon.

The final result of the Tender Offer confirms the preliminary result according to which the valid tender of
shares together with the shares held by the Offeror represent more than 90% of the shares and voting
rights in Vacon. As all the conditions to completion of the Tender Offer have been satisfied, the Offeror
declares the Tender Offer unconditional and completes the Tender Offer in accordance with its terms and
conditions. The offer price will be paid to the shareholders who have validly accepted the Tender Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer on or about 1 December 2014.

The Offeror's intention is to acquire all the shares in Vacon. As the Offeror's ownership in Vacon will
exceed nine-tenths (9/10) of the shares and voting rights in Vacon after the settlement of the shares
already tendered in the Tender Offer, the Offeror intends to initiate compulsory redemption proceedings
for the remaining Vacon shares under the Finnish Companies Act.
The Offeror may purchase shares in Vacon in trading on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd. or otherwise at a
price not exceeding the offer price of EUR 34.00 per share. For the sake of clarity it is noted that the
Offeror will not use its right to extend the offer period by a subsequent offer period as referred to in the
terms and conditions of the Tender Offer.
