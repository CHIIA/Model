Poor's GSCI Total Return Index of 24 commodities climbed 0.6 per cent this month as of 5:08 p.m. in
London. Nickel advanced 15 percent, the most since September 2012, on concern possible sanctions on
Russia will curb supply with an export ban on ore already in place in Indonesia. Russia is the
second-biggest producer of refined nickel.
Rio Tinto Plc sued Vale SA, Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz and his BSG Resources Ltd. alleging they
conspired to steal mining rights to the world's biggest untapped iron-ore deposit by bribing officials in
Guinea. Vale used information obtained from Rio during discussions in New York to buy a stake in the
Simandou property in southeast Guinea.
