TASMANIAN businesswoman Jan Cameron has sold her $36.6 million stake in a Launceston
baby food company following a multimillion- dollar partial settlement with creditors of her failed
Retail Adventures.

The Cameron-run Retail Adventures, which operated 29 Chickenfeed stores in Tasmania,
collapsed in late 2012 with debts of about $200 million.

Last month liquidators Deloitte, on behalf of creditors, reached a settlement with Ms Cameron
regarding a number of claims.
This included an immediate payment of $3.95 million to Deloitte and agreement that Ms Cameron
and her two companies - Discount Superstores Group (DSG) and Bicheno Investments - drop a
$38.4million creditors claim against Retail Adventures.

It's unclear if Ms Cameron, a keen philanthropist, agreed with a key term of creditors that she not
make donations totalling more than $10,000.

Deloitte is still planning legal action against Ms Cameron and two other Retail Adventures directors
for alleged insolvent trading.
Following the partial settlement Ms Cameron sold all her shares in Launceston-based Bellamy's
Austra- lia for $36.6 million.
The developments come as her firmDSG - which bought back Retail Adventures after it collapsed -
enters receivership spelling the possible end to the Crazy Clarkes and Sam's Warehouse outlets.

Meanwhile Bellamy's Australia is planning a float on the Australian Securities Exchange in a bid to
raise $25 million.
If realised the company will have a market capitalisation of nearly $100million in a remarkable
Tasmanian success story.
Bellamy's, which has its office in Tamar Street, got a foothold in China's $1.2 billion baby food
market after the communist country's con- taminated milk scandal.

Bellamy's penetration into Asia relies heavily on Tasmania's clean, green image.
The company started in 2004 as a family-run business before being bought by Tasmanian Pure
Foods, which became Bellamy's Australia.

The float will take place at the end of the month.
