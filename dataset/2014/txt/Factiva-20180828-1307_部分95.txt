The long-abandoned Kinnears Rope Factory is believed to have been sold to a Chinese-backed
development company for $60 million.
R&F Estate Pty Ltd has bought the 4ha site at 124-188 Ballarat Rd, Footscray, after it was
offloaded by property tycoon Richard Gu, according to reports.

State Planning Minister Matthew Guy had given development approval for about 1500 homes in
2012.Kinnears relocated to the site in 1902 but closed in 2002.
