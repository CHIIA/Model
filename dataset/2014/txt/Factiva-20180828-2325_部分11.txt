Perth, Australia, Oct 14, 2014 - (ABN Newswire) - Atrum Coal NL ("Atrum" or the "Company") (ASX:ATU)
(OTCMKTS:ATRCF) is pleased to announce an upgrade to the JORC anthracite resources at the
Company's flagship Groundhog Anthracite Project ("Groundhog"), located in British Columbia, Canada.

Executive Chairman, Mr James Chisholm commented:

TD

"Our development strategy is simple - we plan to sell down a minority equity stake in Groundhog North in
return for complete funding of the first 3Mtpa mine. Subsequent mines can be financed separately through
cash flow or traditional debt, positioning the Company for significant growth."

"Groundhog North now has a massive resource base of more than 600Mt of high and ultra-high grade
anthracite and this covers only a fraction of the broader Groundhog Coalfield. The expanded resource is
being incorporated into the upcoming Supplementary PFS, which in turn will allow the Company to
progress with the proposed partial sell-down of Groundhog North. Interest in Groundhog's highly strategic
ultra-high grade anthracite is very strong."

GROUNDHOG NORTH RESOURCE UPGRADE

The reportable JORC resources at Groundhog North have increased from 305.2Mt to 609.2Mt, the
categories of which are summarised in the table below.

The majority of reported JORC Resources in the Groundhog North area are at a relatively shallow depth
of cover. In excess of 80% of Resources are at a depth of less than 300m.

The table below illustrates the depth cut-off of the JORC resource at the Groundhog North Mine:

The following considerations have been used in the estimate of the JORC anthracite resource:

- 200m river setback with resources on the eastern side of the river not included

- Indicated resource extrapolated 1,000m from points of observation

- Inferred resource extrapolated 2,000m from points of observation

- Maximum 0.3m stone parting
- Minimum 0.4m mining thickness for open cut mining at <300m depth
- Minimum 1m mining thickness for underground mining at >300m depth
It is noted that the overall strategy at Groundhog North is one of low-impact mining.
A comparison of the potential anthracite specifications (notably carbon) at Groundhog North with Chinese
BF Coke, which is an essential input into North Asian blast furnace steel production, indicates an
exceptional product in all specification measures. High grade and ultra-high grade anthracite is used in
steel manufacturing as an economic and environmentally superior substitute for metallurgical coke.
Anthracite is also used in the manufacture of specialty steels and alloys, in electric arc furnaces, for ore
sintering, as a reductant and cathode paste and as an economic alternative to graphite.
The recent upgrade of JORC resources at Groundhog North is in part due to the acquisition of Anglo
Pacificcoal licences (September 2014) located immediately west of the original Groundhog North area.
Incorporating these licences allows simpler mine plans, incorporating longer extraction panels.
It is anticipated this will lead to mining efficiencies and an overall reduction in mine OPEX.

A comparison of the estimated anthracite resource as calculated in May 2014 and October 2014
respectively for the Groundhog North area across the various seams is outlined below. The Seam #70
and the Seam #40 demonstrate the greatest increase in estimated resource compared to the previous
estimate.

GROUNDHOG NORTH - SUPPLEMENTARY PFS
The Company will release a Supplementary PFS in the coming days based on Groundhog North, which
will consider:

- expanded anthracite inventory

- extended mine planning

- optimised surface infrastructure
The initial PFS completed for the first stage of production at Groundhog is based on adit mining of the
Seam #70 and the Seam #40 at Groundhog North. This area represents less than 5% of Groundhog and
only considers 2 out of 20 potentially mineable anthracite seams. Overall economics are expected to
improve with the pending optimisation.
