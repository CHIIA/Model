LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Sept. 16, 2014) - Market research
companyEuromonitor International released today new global packaged food data
showing 3.6% growth in value sales over 2013 to reach USUSD2.4 trillion in
2014.
"Both 2013 and 2014 have so far delivered some of the highest growth rates in
retail value terms in the last decade," said Lamine Lahouasnia, Head of Global
Packaged Food. "This marks a departure from the historically volume-driven
nature of the packaged food industry."
Key findings from Euromonitor International's 2015 Packaged Food research:

-- Record all-time high for both sweet and savoury snacks and confectionery
sales with the categories valued at USUSD125 billion and USUSD198 billion
in
2014, respectively.

-- Another strong year of growth for global dairy reaching USUSD550 billion

in 2019, of which half will be generated from only eight countries:
China, US, Brazil, Russia, France, Japan, Germany and the UK.

-- The cost of cocoa is likely to see a 10% increase by the end of 2014

with Hershey, Mars and other players announcing a price increase of 8%.
With a number of commodities rising in price, the key question for many
in the food industry is how to pass these increased costs to the
consumer and protect profit margins.

-- Less is now more in the packaged food industry. With consumers eating
less in some markets, several brands are charging more for less. For
example, companies have launched 'thins' - lighter and thinner versions
of their original products that sell for considerably more per kilogram
than their counterparts.

Over the next five years, the fastest growing category in packaged food will
be baby food, with 7.8% compound annual growth rate to 2019. Supported by
emerging regions, where the global financial crisis has not had a severe
impact on economic growth and birth rates are still relatively high, the
category sees China at the forefront despite its one child policy.

"Acquisitions this year were geared towards arming food companies with greater
natural and organic credentials that align with their corporate social
responsibility initiatives and product portfolios. General Mills's very recent
acquisition of organic food firm, Annie's, is an example of this trend but it
is by no means an exception. 2014 also saw Hain Celestial acquire Rudi's
organic bakery and WhiteWave Foods purchase of Earthbound Organic. The drive
to absorb these smaller organic organisations is caused not so much because of
the growth of the organic category, but more because of the requirement for
companies engaged in the food industry to align their CSR communications with
their product portfolio."
In 2014, pressure on the food industry from a variety of activist groups and
media resulted in a lot of bad publicity. This led to greater possibility of
regulation, which along with the backdrop of rising commodity prices, greater
political instability, emerging market slowdowns and Russian import bans,
represents one of the major threats for the future of the food industry.
