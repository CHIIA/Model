BUYING OF AUSSIE STOCKS, BONDS, RESOURCES ON REASSURING CHINA NUMBERS
While our market was always likely to trade higher today in a relief rally, China's flash manufacturing PMI
rising in April vs a further fall expected, although still below the 50 level cheered the markets.
Volume was strong at $4.05 billion.
The $A, a proxy for China rose slightly and so much more heartily did Aussie mines particularly iron ore
miners, heavily dependent on China's manufacturing. Aussie bond yields are down 6 points to 3.65%
while the $A is at 92.62US c, up about 15 points on last evening.
