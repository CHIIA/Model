Commercial property

More than $650 million of properties are due to change hands in the coming month, as investors rally
to get a foothold into the tightly held sector.

In Sydney, final bids are being reviewed for a half share of the Westpac Bank headquarters at 275
Kent Street and the Sofitel Sydney Wentworth Hotel in Phillip Street.
It is understood the South Korean pension fund, KKP, is the likely contender to buy Mirvac's half share
in Kent Street, worth about $420 million. A number of parties did preliminary due diligence on the
asset, but were concerned about whether the bank would exercise its option to sublease about 20,000
square metres.

Westpac is consolidating its remaining Sydney offices into new space at Barangaroo, but will also
retain its presence at Kent Street. However, it is said the bank can "opt out" of space in that property
and move staff to the new site opposite.
The second round of bids are also being reviewed for the Sofitel, with a Chinese group, Sun Life
Insurance and City Developments Ltd (CDL) said to be very keen on the site.
Potentially keeping the price down to about $175 million, the hotel does not have a pool or harbour
views and there are strata issues with the car park.
Seller LaSalle Investment Management also has to now compete with the sale of the Sheraton on the
Park, in nearby Elizabeth Street.
Hotels have been keenly sought after. Late last year, the private Chinese investor Fu Wah
International Group made its first major foray into local property with the purchase of Melbourne's
landmark five-star Park Hyatt hotel.

It was believed the price paid was about $135 million, but the agents and buyer declined to comment.
The hotel, at 1 St Andrews Place, near Melbourne's Parliament House, and was developed in 1999 by
Lustig & Moar at a cost of $150 million. The sale involved both the 240-room Park Hyatt and a
commercial car park next door.
The office and hotel sales come as CBRE's Australian head of research, Stephen McNabb, said
first-quarter office sales activity was lower across all sectors - but this followed a record 2013 during
which sales activity eclipsed the previous 2006 record by more than $5 billion.

"The first quarter is seasonally a softer quarter for activity and hence it is more difficult to interpret
trends in a market subject to large and lumpy deals," Mr McNabb said.

retail. Overall, quarterly volumes in Sydney and Melbourne were ahead of year-ago levels, while down
in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide."

CBRE regional director, capital markets, Josh Cullen, said the lower sales activity had been a timing
issue and there had been no signs of any easing in buyer interest.
"The current level of buyer inquiry and the pipeline of property that is either in due diligence or being
marketed at present suggest that sales volumes in the June quarter will be extremely strong," Mr
Cullen said.

"The inquiries we're receiving have been equal to, if not higher, than they were in the first quarter of
last year."

This was evident in the three major office tower campaigns that had recently closed on assets valued
at about $850 million.
