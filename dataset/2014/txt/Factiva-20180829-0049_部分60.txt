0519 GMT [Dow Jones] Nuclear power station restarts at Japanese facilities belonging to Kyushu
Electric Power (9508.TO) and Kansai Electric Power (9503.TO) are likely to occur first when the nation
begins to turn them back on, says Nomura Securities. But downside risks to companies' finances are
nevertheless real, it adds. Restart dates have yet to be determined for reactors 1 and 2 at Kyushu's
Sendai plant (currently under inspection), or for reactors 3 and 4 at Kansai's Takahama plant, which will
be probably be inspected next, says house analyst Shigeki Matsumoto. He notes that neither firm has
applied for usage rate hikes, nor will either immediately return to profitability simply via the restarts. As
such, deteriorating finances will prompt both companies to keep dividends depressed until at least 2017,
he adds. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0517 GMT [Dow Jones] The Indian rupee extends its three-day fall, weakening as much as 60.51 to the
U.S. dollar - a 2.0% depreciation of the currency since Friday. If USD/INR ends Tuesday above 60.79 --
the top of the daily Ichimoku Cloud resistance zone -- chances are high that the rupee will fall even
further. The escalating conflict in Iraq has led to general risk aversion away from emerging-market
currencies, but in particular affects the rupee because India relies heavily on oil from Iraq. The cost of
crude oil has gone up significantly since Friday due to the increased likelihood of oil-supply
interruptions. USD/INR is now at 60.39 from its Monday close of 60.17. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0459 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar fell 0.32% Tuesday morning against its New Zealand
counterpart to 1.0794, its weakest since May 27, after minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's June 3
policy meeting revealed the RBA expects the nation's economy to remain sluggish this year and believes
record-low interest rates are needed for support for some time. That's in contrast to the hawkish
monetary policy statement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand last Thursday which said New
Zealand's economic expansion has considerable momentum and inflationary pressures are expected to
increase. RBNZ signaled more rate increases in coming months. Further downside in spot AUD/NZD
may encounter support at the 100-day moving average, now at 1.0786, and then at the May 21 reaction
low of 1.0741. Spot AUD/NZD was recently at 1.0804. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0455 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares of heavily weighted SoftBank (9984.TO) are off 2.2% at Y7,508 on
concerns over the growth rate of its Chinese e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holdings. Alibaba,
which will list its shares in the U.S. this fall in what is expected to be one of the largest IPOs in history,
reported that its quarterly operating margin fell to 45.3% from 51.3% a year ago. SoftBank owns over
34% of Alibaba. "The Alibaba listing runs the risk of being perhaps the most overhyped IPOs ever, and
thus its benefactors may suffer the backlash if anything is rumored to be amiss," says an equity trading
director at a European brokerage. "Shares look technically heavy around the Y8,000 mark, making them
easier to sell," says Nobuyuki Fujimoto, a senior market analyst at SBI Securities.

to as low as 0.9351 from 0.9400 late New York. The yuan fell to 6.2330 from 6.2250 in the
over-the-counter market and the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.83% to 2068.70. The Australian
dollar was hurt earlier Tuesday after minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's June 3 policy meeting
revealed the RBA expects the nation's economy to remain sluggish this year and believes record-low
interest rates are needed as a support measure for some time. Further downside in the Australian/U.S.
dollar pair may encounter support at 0.9338, and then at the 0.9326-0.9316 band. Spot AUD/USD was
last at 0.9358. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0449 GMT [Dow Jones] It's time to take politics out of the tax system Down Under, concludes a report
from EY. The advisory firm urges Australia's government to establish an independent commission that
would take on the responsibilities of the Board of Taxation as well as some treasury functions. "With the
right processes and institutions we can build a tax system that does not prejudice local businesses or
foreign investors and meets the revenue requirements of the nation," says EY CEO Rob McLeod, who
led the most recent review of New Zealand's tax system. He says Australia's personal and company tax
rates are well ahead of OECD average, but the system fails to support home-grown businesses, fails to
make Australia attractive to foreign investment and is beholden to the short-term needs of the electoral
cycle. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
0444 GMT [Dow Jones] China Merchants Bank, Industrial Banks and Bank of Chongqing said Monday
they are eligible for 50bps cuts in reserve requirement ratio. Barclays estimates these three "targeted
RRR" cuts could release CNY35 billion in additional liquidity into the market, helping the country's
micro-lending. The move shows "the central bank is reluctant to do a full-blown RRR cut but that it will
continue with moderate loosening measures," Barclays says. This would reduce risks of rising bad loans,
and should thus support a near-term rebound in Chinese bank shares. Barclays says Bank of China
remains its top pick, but it also favors Agricultural Bank of China and China Merchants Bank. CMB's
H-shares are down 0.1% after a 1.5% jump Monday. (fiona.law@wsj.com)
0438 GMT [Dow Jones] The China-sensitive Australian dollar weakened against the U.S. currency on
Tuesday to as low as 0.9351 from 0.9400 late New York, as the yuan fell to 6.2330 from 6.2250 in the
over-the-counter market and the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.83% to 2068.70. Earlier Tuesday
the Australian dollar was hurt after minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's June 3 policy meeting
revealed the RBA sees the nation's economy remaining sluggish this year and considers that record-low
interest rates are needed to support it for some time. Further downside in the AUD/USD pair may
encounter support at 0.9338, and then at the 0.9326-0.9316 band. Spot AUD/USD was last at 0.9358.

0428 GMT [Dow Jones] UOB has slashed forecasts of Singapore's 2014 non-oil domestic export growth
to 4% from 7%, citing the city-state's surprise exports slump in May. The bank also points to rising risks
from emerging-market slowdown and potential oil-price rises on unrest in Iraq. However, UOB remains
more optimistic than Singapore's trade agency, which foresees between 1%-3% non-oil domestic export
growth this year. Official data shows that exports of goods made in Singapore fall 6.6% in May on-year
after a 0.9% rise in April. Poor electronics exports--a major factor in May's slump--extends the sector's
long-term decline, though UOB notes that this "shows Singapore's exports are increasingly being
diversified towards other product segments as the economy undergoes economic restructuring amid the
current tight labour market condition." (chunhan.wong@wsj.com)

0415 GMT [Dow Jones] ING anticipates that the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy committee will slash
rates at its Wednesday meeting, breaking consensus. Most analysts expect the bank to hold its one-day
repurchase rate at 2% after its first meeting since May's military coup, but ING disagrees. "In essence,
while the BoT makes it clear that it does not consider monetary policy to be among Thailand's principal
economic problems we think it will want to reinforce the pro-growth message the military government
now seeks to send," ING says. It expects a cut to 1.75%. (jake.watts@wsj.com; @jmwatts_)
0409 GMT [Dow Jones] The MOF sells Y1.1 trillion of 1.5% 20-year bonds with the lowest price of
100.55 yielding 1.464%, lower than street forecasts for a lowest price of 100.60. "It was slightly weak,"
says Deutsche Securities strategist Makoto Yamashita, adding that investors such as life-insurance
companies were likely cautious about buying with yields at current levels. He said, however, the result
wouldn't likely have an impact on the secondary market. The bid-to-cover ratio deteriorates to 2.71 from
3.56 at the last tender, while the tail is shorter at 0.08 vs. 0.11. Lead September JGB futures are little
changed on the result; the contract is up 0.08 at 145.27. (eleanor.warnock@wsj.com)
