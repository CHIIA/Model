AVIATION: Virgin Australia’s earnings performance on the highly competitive trans-Tasman route has
improved from loss-making to a profit as a result of accounting policy changes and its alliance with Air
New Zealand. The Australian airline’s NZ operations posted a $NZ31 million ($28.86m) profit in the
year ended June 30, compared with a loss of $NZ9m the year before, according to accounts for Virgin
Australia Airlines (NZ) filed with New Zealand’s Companies Office. Revenue rose $NZ1.86m to
$NZ274m. The bottom-line earnings reflect changes to Virgin’s accounting policies after two of its
largest shareholders, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines, began recording a part of the profits or losses from
Virgin in their own accounts.

TRADE: China’s stuttering economy suffered another blow in November as export growth slowed
sharply and imports surprisingly contracted, resulting in a record monthly trade surplus. Exports
expanded 4.7 per cent year-on-year to $US211.66 billion ($255.44bn) in November, while imports
dropped 6.7 per cent to $157.19bn, the General Administration of Customs said yesterday. The surplus
soared 61.4 per cent to a record $US54.47bn in the month, Customs said, beating August’s previous
record of $US49.8bn.
RESOURCES: Ninety per cent of iron ore mines in China’s Shandong province have production costs
higher than the current market price for iron ore, sparking fear of widespread closures as iron ore prices
hover about $US70, according to China Business News. The paper said the price of domestically
produced iron ore had dropped 26 per cent since November. Chinese iron ore miners have complained
about the industry’s heavy tax burden as it faces further downward pressure.
AGRIBUSINESS: Fonterra may cut its forecast milk payout by a fifth this week with dwindling prospects
that the price of whole milk powder will recover enough to support its current estimate. Whole milk
powder sold at $US2229 ($2411.69) a tonne in last week’s Global Dairy Trade auction and would need
to surge 57 per cent by March to reach the $US3500 a tonne level that Fonterra chief Theo Spierings
has said the current forecast payout of $US5.30 a kilogram of milk solids is predicated on. The chances
of that sort of recovery are slipping away, as the board prepares to review the forecast.
