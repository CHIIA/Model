ICON Energy and its partners plan to identify sweet-spot gas-flows at their Cooper Basin tenement
where a six-well program has identified a potential major resource.
Managing director Ray James told the Gold Coast company’s annual meeting four wells were being
flow-tested and it was time to flow-test separate formations within wells.

He said the Etty 1 well, where one zone yielded flow of 870,000 cubic feet a day, highlighted the
potential of the sweet-spot program.

“It is very exciting and I am encouraged by the result,” Mr James said. He said Icon and its partners,
Beach Energy and Chevron Australia, were pioneers in tapping gas in the Cooper Basin’s Nappamerri
Trough, drilling to depths beyond 4000m.

“They are deep, hot, high-pressure wells and the drilling exercise is unique in the world,” he said.
“A Beach Oil rig built in the US for the purpose is revealing its limitations. “Drilling is governed by the
rig’s pressure capability which is about 10,000 pounds per square inch,” Mr James said.

“We want to drill deeper, to about 5000m, and to do that we need a bigger rig.” He said Chevron’s
deep drilling expertise had made a big contribution, and the partners had searched the world to
acquire knowledge.

Mr James said commercialisation would come only after confirmation of a major resource and would
likely see the sale of gas into the domestic market.
Icon has a contract to supply to China and was focused on building probable reserves.

Mr James said Icon wanted to slash well costs.
The six wells cost more than $100 million and the partners aimed to cut cost to below $12 million per
well.

“We are looking at what we can do to take that forward,” Mr James said. He said the joint-venture
program was complete and while Chevron could opt out of further activity he was confident it would
remain a player.

“It is excited about the Nappamerri Trough,” he said.

Mr James said with gas prices high and demand growing, “Icon can and will play a significant role in
meeting demand”.

Chairman Stephen Barry said directors “are disappointed our share price (about 10¢) does not reflect
the intrinsic value, but we are confident it will recover when market sentiment improves”.

and exploration.It received a research and development refund of $7.49 million to close the year with
a $1.57 million net profit, a cash balance of $21.11 million, no debt, and a 10 trillion cubic feet
prospective gas resource.
