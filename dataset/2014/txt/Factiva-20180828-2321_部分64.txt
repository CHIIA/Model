Every H&M store has an "A Area," which is the first thing you see when you enter. It features mannequins
in styled outfits to encourage shoppers to buy
I had my first experience 10 years ago-my first H&M shopping experience, that is! It was early November
and I was in Madrid, Spain to visit my sister, who had moved there a few years before. It was chillier than
I expected, so she took me to H&M to buy a coat. I found a pea green brocade coat with a high collar and
a hook-and-eye closure-certainly a standout when most people prefer black or brown when it comes to
outerwear. I don't remember how much it cost, but what struck me was that it looked like a designer piece
without the high price. I bought it. I still have that coat and always pack it when I travel to colder climes.

And today, many Filipinos will get their first H&M experience as the first H&M store in the country opens at
Mega Fashion Hall.
Exactly a month ago, a group of Filipino journalists and I had the chance to visit the H&M headquarters in
Stockholm, Sweden. Being an H&M fan, I thought I knew a lot about this brand (apart from the fact that
it's Swedish), but boy was I wrong. In the three days we spent there with members of their design team,
the PR department, the group that handles the photo studio for all images, their HR head, store staff, and
even the CEO, it was clear that H&M was more than just a conglomerate; it was like a family. The
corporate culture is one that fosters teamwork, has strong values, and all work for the same goal: to
provide its customers with fashion and quality at the best price.

1. H&M's founder Erling Persson came from a family of butchers. Persson started out selling cheese, but
after a trip to the US where he saw a store selling women's dresses at very low prices, he thought it was a
good business idea. So he opened his first women's clothing store in Västeras, Sweden in 1947 and
called it Hennes (which means “hers” in Swedish). In the 60s, he wanted to expand to men's clothing, so
he bought the adjacent store called Mauritz Widforss, which sold men's hunting and fishing gear. In 1968,
he changed the name to Hennes & Mauritz, which was eventually shortened to H&M, the font of which
has not changed since it was created. Curiously, no one at the company could remember exactly when it
was created or by whom! (Their best guess was late 60s/early 70s by an interior decorator.)

2. H&M's CEO is under 40 years old. Karl-Johan Persson, the founder's grandson, was born in 1975. He
assumed the CEO position in 2009. “I never had the chance to work closely with my father or grandfather,
but I think our management style is quite similar in that we think about the H&M culture all the time,” said
Karl-Johan. “It's a lot about teamwork, delegating responsibility, constantly pushing for innovation, and
having an entrepreneurial spirit.” He added that a huge challenge is to keep the bureaucracy away. “We're
a big company, but we want to keep that startup feeling, and work with fun, friendly people who have
good values and great drive.”
3. It is mandatory at H&M for each and every employee to work in the store at least two days of the
year-that includes top management and the CEO! “I worked for two days last summer here in Sweden,”
Karl-Johan told us. “I think I slowed down the pace at the cashier because I found it hard to do the
de-alarming, folding the clothes in a nice way, and putting them in the bag,” he added, with a sheepish

be made.
4. H&M is now in 55 countries. The Philippines is the 55th! Just last April, they opened the first Australian
store in Melbourne; this week they opened in Sydney. In 2015, they will open the first branches in Taiwan,
India, Peru, and South Africa. So what took them so long to come here? “We get that question from every
country we enter,” said Karl-Johan. “We always knew that the Philippines is a super interesting market,
but we have to look at several things-the size of the market, fashion interest, expansion opportunities,
how easy it is to do business in the country… We have an expansion team that had been traveling to the
Philippines for four or five years, looking for the best location-that's very important.” Added Hacan
Andersson of H&M's communications & press department, “If we don't find it, we'd rather wait.”

5. In 2014, H&M opened approximately 350 new stores. Most of them were in the US, the UK, and China.
They have 116,000 employees all over the world. The Mega Fashion Hall branch alone will have 100
sales associates. “When we open in a new market, the staff-from sales all the way to the top level-have to
work in an H&M store and get training in a nearby market,” said Hacan. Dan Mejia, H&M Philippines' PR
manager, got his training in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur. “That way, the culture is
transferred,” added Hacan.
6. The skinny trouser is H&M's best-selling item for women all over the world. For men, it's the white shirt.
“It's funny, but it took ages for them to start selling,” said Ann-Sofie Johansson, head of design for H&M.
“We had been trying for 10 years, and now we can't get rid of them!” she added, laughing. “We've been
wanting to try looser trousers or something with flare. We want to give the customer something different,
but no, they want their skinny trousers!” Andreas Löwenstam, head of menswear, said it was similar with
menswear: “For such a long time, all men wanted to have were boot-cut jeans-that was the only thing we
sold. But now I think it is much more individual, so you really would have both, the skinny would be as
important as the flared ones.”

7. Yes, we will get the Alexander Wang collection! The collection drops worldwide on November 7. Wang
designed 20 pieces for men and 40 for women, plus assorted accessories, such as bags, shoes, and
sunglasses. Margareta van den Bosch, creative advisor who has been with H&M for 27 years, said,
“Designer collaborations take more or less nine months from sketch to production. Because we also
develop a lot of other things, such as special shopping bags, hangers, and labels.”
8. H&M has actually turned down designers who wanted to collaborate with them. But they won't say who!
The first designer collaboration was with Karl Lagerfeld in 2004. Hacan related how it happened. “One
day someone said, why do we need to do another underwear campaign? Can't we do something else?
Let's do a collaboration with a fashion designer. Let's do it with Karl Lagerfeld!” Apparently, the Kaiser had
noticed that the girls in his office had started mixing Chanel with H&M and he realized that it was a new
thing. Of course, he said yes. But believe it or not, no matter how big the designer, they all get nervous
before the collection drops. “Karl called our marketing director the day before the launch. He said what if
no one shows up, what if we don't sell,” recalled Hacan. “Roberto Cavalli was the same, he said, I'm so
scared. For the Lanvin launch, Alber Elbaz was in New York sitting in the car outside the store. He called
Margareta and said, there's no line outside the store! She told him, well, you're on the wrong side of the
building!” All collaboration collections have sold well, but the fastest to sell out were Versace in 2011 and
Isabel Marant in 2013.
9. H&M is committed to its social responsibility and work with sustainability. Apart from being pro-active in
making positive changes for the environment within its production-for example, training cotton farmers to
use better techniques, saving millions of liters of water in washing denim, transporting goods via sea or
train-they also encourage customers to do their part. H&M is the first fashion company in the world to
offer customers the opportunity to bring to the store their unwanted clothes, which will then be recycled
into new materials.

underwear, activewear, maternity, and accessories-there are concepts within. For example, for ladies,
there is “modern classic,” which you will recognize by its gray label; “trend,” which speaks for itself and
can be a little higher priced; “everyday,” which picks out styles from modern classic and trend, and makes
them more affordable; LOGG, which stands for Label Of Graded Goods and is for the outdoorsy type;
Divided, which is inspired by streetwear; and Conscious Collection, their eco-friendly line, which uses
sustainable material such as organic cotton. (H&M is the biggest user of organic cotton in the world.)
H&M opens today at 9am till midnight at Mega Fashion Hall, SM Megamall. The first 200 in line will get
gift cards up to P6,000. There will be opening-day discounts of up to 50% off. Regular store hours of
10am-10pm will resume on October 20. H&M will open soon at SM Makati, Robinsons Magnolia,
Robinsons Manila, and SM North Edsa
