ENVESTRA majority shareholder APA Group has sold its stake in the South Australian utilities
company to Hong Kong bidder Cheung Kong group – realising $784 million in gross proceeds.
After a lengthy silence on the $1.32 offer that valued Envestra at $2.37 billion, which trumped its own
ambitions for a takeover of Envestra, APAEnergy finally accepted the HK offer. The Cheung Kong
consortium now owns 72.83 per cent of Envestra, with the unconditional offer extended to August 21.

The deal will consolidate Cheung Kong’s position in Australian utilities, adding to its 51 per cent holding
in SA Power Networks, and the same stakes in Victorian power distributors Citipower and Powerco.

As previously highlighted by Envestra managing director Ian Little, it could still mean that South
Australia loses one of its few listed company headquarters – and with the jobs of up to 100 service
providers affected.

However, the consortium is yet to detail its plans for Envestra’s Adelaide presence or SA workforce.
APA Group’s decision will help it realise an estimated pre-tax profit of $430 million to be reported in
the consolidated results for FY15.
On July 25, it also received $21 million as a result of the controversial fast-tracked final 3.5c dividend.

APA says it intends to use the cash for ongoing growth and investment projects over the next 12-18
months. APA managing director Mick McCormack said the cash offer put forward by the consortium
would exceed its own valuation of the Envestra business, even at full ownership.

“While our rationale for owning the Envestra business remains sound, APA assessed the value
proposition of the offer and concluded that selling out of this investment and redeploying proceeds in
other opportunities will provide better long term value for APA securityholders.” APA Group will
continue to operate and manage Envestra assets under contractual arrangements until 2027.

Envestra owns about 23,000km of natural gas distribution networks and 1100km of transmission
pipelines.
It has about 1.2 million customers in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, NSW and the Northern
Territory.Envestra is likely to post a $150 million record profit when it announces its full-year results
next week.
