Treasury Wine Estates boss Michael Clarke will not allow calamitous acquisitions made by former
management or circling private equity suitors deter him from beating a path to the US, and has
signalled an appetite for acquiring premium Californian wine brands to augment his ambitious growth
strategy.

Mr Clarke - who on Thursday unveiled his maiden result as chief executive, which showed a loss of
$100.9 million for fiscal 2014 against a profit of $47.2 million in the previous year - said better times
were ahead.

"I would hope there is upside from here," Mr Clarke said.
But the upside could be captured by private equity rather than existing shareholders, with Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, along with an unnamed second bidder presumed to be TPG, both pitching a takeover
set at $5.20 a share, to value the winemaker at $3.4 billion.

Mr Clarke said acquisitions were still on his agenda, despite the uncertainty around the bids and
Foster's disastrous $6 billion splurge on wine assets that brought the brewer to its knees and led it to
spin off Treasury Wine more than two years ago.

"We believe there is an opportunity to accelerate our growth, especially in the areas of 'masstige'
[mass production, prestige wines] and luxury wines propositions in North America."
Treasury Wine's loss for 2014 was driven by $281 million in write-downs, with pre-tax earnings of
$184.6 million in line with forecasts.
The Australia-New Zealand arm suffered a one-third slide in earnings to $75.1 million.
An austerity drive in China saw Asian earnings drop 12.5 per cent to $47.7 million.
Earnings in the Americas rose 12.1 per cent to $74.9 million.
The company declared a final dividend of 7¢ a share, unfranked and payable on October 2.
