*Banks have contributed 7 positive points to the index, resources have contributed 4.6 positive points,

Our market has recovered about 36% of yesterday's fall intra day, with banks leading the way after
yesterday's huge sell off in the sector. Better US retail numbers last night, and two senators saying the
tapering must remain on track led to markets returning to "business as usual" at least for now. Volume
was low at midday.

"High will be 5257. Low 5220. Close at 5242, up 30 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of The Sextant Report said, "Our market looks set to open higher with our
local futures contract up 30 points.

"Global equities were given some breathing room overnight with a moderate pull back in the Japanese
yen.

"Over in the US the Semiconductor index hit a new rally high and with the Trannies on the verge of doing
the same, there is a green light for US equities to hit new rally highs.

"Volume yesterday in our market, while higher than what we have witnessed recently, was not that
significant, suggesting it is just a pullback on the way to a new, perhaps final, rally high.

"The high today will be 5257. The low will be 5220. When the dust has settled the market will have closed
at 5242, up 30 points".

The S&P/ASX200 fell 80.1 points to 5212 last evening.

*CNU: Chorus Ltd announced it will release its half year result prior to market opening on February 24.

*FSF: Fonterra locates and recalls batches of e-coli contaminated fresh cream The Waikato Times
reported today, "Fonterra's chairman and board are being asked to resign by a Waikato farmer and
Fonterra shareholder Russ Rimmington after the dairy giant's latest food safety scare.

Page230of297©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Fonterra yesterday said a batch of fresh cream supplied to Anchor and Pams was contaminated with E
coli and recalled 8700 bottles - of 300ml and 500ml - of the product.

Mr Rimmington was angry that nearly 24 hours after the recall was announced through media Mr Wilson
had not contacted the co-operative's 10,500 farmer shareholders to explain the situation.

Fonterra shareholder and Waikato Federated Farmers provincial president James Houghton was also
frustrated at the lack of communication provided to shareholders.

Mr Houghton said he only learned about the E coli contamination through the emailed news service
provided by The Global Dairy news service yesterday morning.

"It is frustrating, as a farmer, that these things happen."

But Waikato farmer Bruce Rowe was impressed with Fonterra Brands managing director Peter McClure
communicating that it was the first positive test for E coli in nearly 20 years.

"That was clever, but I don't think this is anything like the botulism scare."
Federated Farmers dairy section chairman Willy Leferink said the recall showed that Fonterra's quality
assurance systems worked.

"It also shows that traceability is working because the co-op has zeroed in on the batches involved and
locations they were sold in."
