These are the highlights from each end of the auto spectrum in LA

THE Los Angeles motor show is increasingly becoming an event of two extremes. On one hand LA is
the home of Pimp My Ride and chromed bling, on the other it’s the spiritual home of the hybrid (the
technology was pioneered in Japan but US drivers embraced it in the millions).

These are the highlights from the frugal and lavish ends of the automotive spectrum, from the Los
Angeles motor show.

TOYOTA MIRAI It looks like a catfish but it’s a genius piece of work.

It can be fuelled by garbage, generates enough electricity to power your house for a week, emits only
water — and will be in showrooms next year.
Almost 20 years after Toyota launched the first Prius — and more than seven million hybrid sales later
— the Mirai promises to be a hydrogen-powered car for the masses that takes over where the Prius
leaves off.

It has an unusual appearance because its hi-tech hydrogen system needs special cooling; sharp
creases in the bodywork help it slip through the air more efficiently.

Unlike pure electric cars, the Mirai can be refuelled in less than five minutes and travel 480km on one
tank, about the same as a regular car.

“Hydrogen can be made from virtually anything, even garbage,” says Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the
company founder.

There is a significant hurdle. Hydrogen refuelling stations are scarce in the US, Japan and Europe and
there are none in Australia.
The Mirai will go on sale in the US for $57,500 or on a $499 a month lease. HONDA FCX Honda’s
latest concept also uses fuel cell technology and will go on sale in the US and Japan in March 2016.
Honda says its latest hydrogen car packs 60 per cent more energy than previously into a fuel cell that’s
33 per cent smaller and is also good for 480km. The Honda will be the first hydrogen car with the entire
fuel cell setup under the bonnet.
MERCEDES-BENZ MAYBACH The preferred ride of gangsta rappers, Middle East oil tycoons, and
super-rich Chinese business types, the Maybach brand was withdrawn from sale in Australia three
years before it was axed globally.

Now it’s back as a stretched, super-long S-Class limousine powered by a 6.0-litre V12 (390kW/830Nm).

Australia — $300,000 more than the dearest S-Class — but it’s an order-only proposition. You’ll have to
fly overseas if you want to test drive one.
PORSCHE The fastest Porsche 911 with a manual gearbox will go on sale in Australia with prices
ranging from $268,000-$313,000.

The 911 GTS uses a tweaked version of the Carrera S’s 3.8-litre boxer six-cylinder engine to generate
316kW and will be sold as a 2+2 coupe and cabriolet in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive.

A seven-speed manual transmission is standard, though the dual-clutch seven-speed auto is an option.

All GTS models are fitted with Porsche’s Chrono performance package and active suspension
management and the GTS coupe has a claimed 100km/h sprint time of 4.0 seconds flat.

Meanwhile, V8 propulsion has been ditched in favour of a twin-turbo V6 for the new Cayenne GTS that
goes on sale in Australia from February, starting from $154,600.

The good news is the drop in cylinders doesn’t correspond to decreased performance, with the new
GTS pumping out 323kW/660Nm. That’s backed up by better fuel economy, with the official rating
dropping by almost a litre to 9.8L/100km.

The GTS takes its front bumper and red brake calipers from the Turbo model, along with a revised rear
bumper and spoiler and a 20mm lower ride height, courtesy of active suspension. Key elements are
blacked out, or black-painted, including the 20-inch rims, light surrounds and exhaust tips.

BMW X5M /X6M SUVs are stealing sales away from sports cars, says BMW. So it has an answer for
that: a super-fast SUV. The X5M is the answer to the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and promises blistering
performance from a family-sized SUV, presumably to get the kids to school on time.

The turtle-shaped X6M is an answer to a question no one asked but BMW says it designed it to appeal
to younger buyers who don’t like the look of the family-sized SUV.BMW marketing experts reckon the
X6M says “I’m single and don’t have kids”. With an X6M you may be single for longer than you think.
Prices are yet to be confirmed but bank on close to $200,000.
