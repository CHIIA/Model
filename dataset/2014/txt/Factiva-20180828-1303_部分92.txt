RIO Iron ore earnings were up 10 per cent on the prior year.
The next largest contributor to earnings was copper, followed by the long troubled aluminium division .

The energy division, which includes coal and uranium, improved to a $US19 million loss.
That comes in the wake of Rio's disastrous $US4 billion-plus loss on the sale of its coal assets in
Mozambique.
The company's net debt reduced by $US1.9 billion in the six months to $US16.1 billion ($A17.42
billion).

Mr Walsh said he was confident of the long term fundamentals of demand for its products, while
recognising the changing nature of China's economic development.

"Global GDP growth in 2014 is expected to exceed three per cent which will support commodity
demand," he said.
"The Chinese government is dealing effectively with the rebalancing of its economy, with its desired
GDP growth of 7.5 per cent in 2014 on target."
China is Rio's key iron ore market and Mr Walsh said high cost iron ore producers were exiting the
market, leaving Rio well placed.

Extra supply through large expansions of major mines has led to predictions of over-supply and falling
iron ore prices.
