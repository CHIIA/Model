Freedom Foods is looking for Asian partners to launch its allergy-free cereal business to bolster
exports in the region.

Managing director Rory Macleod said the company hoped its cereals arm could replicate its Pactum
Dairy operation - which produces long-life milk for one of China's biggest dairy companies, Bright
Foods.
Freedom last week posted an 11.6 per cent slide in net profit to $12.1 million in the year to June 30.
Mr Macleod attributed the decline to booking a pre-tax profit of $11.8 million the year before from
reducing its stake in a2 Milk from 25 to 17.9 per cent.
Freedom grew its sales 5.97 per cent to $104.6 million and investors lifted the company's shares in
response.

Mr Macleod expected more sales growth from increased exports to the US and Asia.

"We want to be quite thoughtful about what we'll do," he said. "It's not a case of taking the whole
range over there and see who will bite. You have to be very careful about what products you are
going to take up there and sell."
Mr Macleod said working with a Chinese company therefore was preferable to relying on distributors.
"In China it's about partnerships, collaboration, which we prefer to do and we enjoy because it's about
value-adding on the products and ideas side, and your partner taking it to market and dealing with
consumers.

"We have got a couple of groups that we have in mind, but it is a little way off."

Mr Macleod said he expected Freedom Foods would be able to ramp up cereal exports to Asia later
next year or in early 2016.

The focus on cereals comes five months after Freedom and Bright Foods struck a UHT supply deal,
which is worth about $40 million.

"We see that as an opportunity to leverage Freedom's uniqueness and capability," Mr Macleod said.
