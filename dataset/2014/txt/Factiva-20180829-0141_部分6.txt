in line with market expectations.

Analysts cautioned that the ongoing Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31, probably
dragged on output as manufacturers shut up shop for China's biggest annual holiday, Reuters reported.

Our profit reporting season seems to have got off to an earlier than usual start, with JB Hi Fi (who had
pre-announced exactly the same numbers on January 18) announcing interim results.
"Mondayitis" is likely to prevail in the absence of any more major reports and with China and several other
Asian neighbors on holiday except for Japan, activity in the Asian day is likely to be limited.

"Floor will be 5125. Ceiling will be 5241.. close at 5169, down 21 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
the local futures contract down 23 points. The weight of evidence suggests that our market should
challenge its 28-October-2013 high of 5457 points going forward.

"The same evidence warns us however that it may be the last act in an intermediate term topping process.
"The retailers are the canary in the coal mine - they took out their December low on the recent downturn
and look set to challenge their June-2012 low in due course.

"The Tech sector, another growth sector, came close to breaking its December low. "And the banks are
struggling too.

"Unless these sectors gain upside traction, the writing is on the wall for a larger decline going forward.

5125. The ceiling will be 5241. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at 5169, down 21
points.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 1.9 points to 5190 last Friday.

Job ads in Australia fell in January for the third consec month

ANZ reported jobs fell in January for the third straight month, but the pace of decline moderated, taking the
year-on-year rate of fall to -8.9%. This was markedly slower than the year-on-year fall of over 15% seen in
most months of 2013. In trend terms, job ads contracted by a modest 0.3% in January, which was the
slowest rate of monthly decline since early 2012.

ANZ said it remains cautious about reading too much into job ads trend around

the turn of the year due to changes in timing of trading days around the

holiday. But ANZ still said it expects to see the beginnings of a moderate

upturn in advertising. There were some positive signs of improving labour demand

in a number of areas, ANZ said, adding, despite declining quite sharply in

January, labour demand in New South Wales had been trending modestly higher

according to a number of different job ads and vacancies measures. Job ads in

Western Australia and the Northern Territory had improved in trend terms in

recent months, following significant weakness over the past two years or so as
mining activity moderated and job advertising in Victoria fell, but at a much

slower pace.

The company, the 4th largest seller of electricity in the National electricity Market, said in preparation for a
possible bid by EPW for the Macquarie Generation assets in NSW, the company has decided to issue
early guidance for 2015 on a stand alone basis excluding any outcome on a possible Macquarie
Generation bid. EPW's "business as usual" 2015 EBITDAIF guidance is $102 million/$106 million and
underlying NPAT guidance is $36/39 million.
Analyst comment: on January 21 a leading broker, valuing MacGen at $1.4 billion said the acquisition
would be game changing for EPW. However with a significant capital raising likely needed to fund the
transacton ($A320/430 million) and a higher cost of funding compared with competing biddrs, we believe
it will be tough for EPW to get over the line".

Our Week's Special dated June 10 2011. EPW was trading at $1.61.5.
