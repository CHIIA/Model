The loonie has attracted a lot of new attention over the last couple of days with traders taking another look
at Canada in response to Burger King's planned purchase of Tim Hortons. The interest goes far beyond
the demand for Canadian dollars that would be needed to pay shareholders.

The deal has shaken up perceptions about Canada in a big way. Who would have thought of Canada as a
tax haven? Really? (I"m still pinching myself from time to time to be sure I"m not dreaming this). The deal
reminds the world that even with its recent sluggishness on jobs, Canada remains an attractive country
with a stable political and banking system, economy and apparently a low business tax rate. This week's
deal has also kicked off speculation that more inversion deals could be on their way that could increase
demand for loonies even further.

CAD has broken out today, calling off a head and shoulders pattern that had been forming. It may remain
active through the rest of the week with US GDP Thursday and Canada GDP Friday giving traders a
chance to compare momentum in the two economies.

NZD and AUD have also been climbing today, joining the resource dollar party as USD has paused for a
rest along with US stocks ahead of tomorrow's US GDP report. NZD appears to be staging an overdue
technical bounce from oversold conditions with yesterday's poor New Zealand food price data apparently
sparking a round of profit taking on short positions.

It's another quiet day for news in Asia Pacific countries but news flow picks up again tomorrow with the
release of Japan's main basket of monthly indicators heading into next week's PMI reports and RBA
meeting. The Hang Seng has dropped back under 25,000 and how it acts over the next day or so may
indicate if current trading is a consolidation or a correction.
