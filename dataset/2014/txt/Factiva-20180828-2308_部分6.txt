(RTTNews) - Mining companyRio Tinto plc (RTPPF.PK, RIO.L, RIO, RTNTF.PK) and Sinosteel Corp. on
Monday signed a Heads of Agreement, with plans to take forward their discussion regarding the second
extension to the Channar Mining iron ore joint venture in Western Australia's Pilbara region.
The original Channar joint venture, which was signed in 1987, provided for the production of 200 million
tonnes of iron ore and was extended in 2010 to produce a further 50 million tonnes of iron ore. Rio
Tinto holds 60 per cent stake, while Sinosteel holds the remaining 40 per cent in the JV.

"The Channar joint venture was a ground-breaking partnership formed in the early stages of the
development of the Chinese steel industry. It's now one of China's longest running and most successful
partnerships with Australia and a model for economic co-operation between our two countries," said Sam
Walsh, Rio Tinto's chief executive.
The signing was at Parliament House in Canberra and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime
Minister Tony Abbott attended the ceremony. The finalization of the mutual agreement for a second
extension is expected to happen during 2016.
