MARKET REPLACES YESTERDAY'S LOSS WHILE $A SURGES ON JOBS

Resources rose strongly, banks were higher as the market responded to a stronger than expected job
number for February. The $A is at 90.71US c, up a little over 1US c from last evening.

*Our market may also be rising on a little 'safe haven" buying - far from the likely problems Ukraine is
likely to cause in Europe, and in the US.
Also of interest, Dr Alasdair Cowden, respected CEO of Altona Mining said today an independent review
of the Little Eva copper mine 2012 DFS had found significantly improved profitability - including a lower
$A and a lower contractor cost. He said in the report, " the marked improvement in costs highlights that
the Australian mining sector is regaining its international competitiveness'.

*Leighton fell 34c to $21.90 on 2.45m shares with HOCHTIEF's $22.50 offer now seen as the ceiling.
ABC News reports Leighton may be facing writedowns of more than $2 billion, relating to a blow out in
costs for a jetty at the Gorgon LNG project in WA and unpaid receipts from the Middle East operation
Habtoor Leighton.
It pointed to $5.1 billion in receivables at the interim, which was better than expected - attributed largely
to the LNG projects.
The report said the 74% stake rather than a takeover means HOCHTIEF (now owned by Spanish
company ACS) will not be required to refinance Leighton's complex debt structure.
*Iron Ore miners recovered, with BCI up 24c to $4.96 while Atlas rose 5.5c to 97.5c on 22.39m shares.
*Graphite company Syrah rose 44c to $3.59 on 1.12m shares.

The Shanghai market rose sharply after Premier Li Keqiang at the end of the annual meeting of
lawmakers today pledged to provide a stable environment for economic growth.
China's Industrial Production numbers for February are due out shortly.

*It appears that the EU and the US will content themselves with imposing some sanctions against Russia
if Crimea votes to secede to Russia, as is expected.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures is up 50 points to 14,880 points, Shanghai CSI physical is up 25.27
points to 2022.96, Hang Seng futures is up 63 points to 21,969 points, S&P futures is up 5.20 points to
1872.90, Nasdaq futures is up 11 points to 3717.75, Dow futures is up 44 points to 16,383 points. Spot
gold is up $6.22 to $1373.06. Crude futures are up 31c to $98.30.
