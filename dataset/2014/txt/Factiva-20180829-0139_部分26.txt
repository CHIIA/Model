Sydney (Platts)--6Feb2014/1140 pm EST/440 GMT (Updating with analyst comment)
Australia's Woodside Petroleum has agreed to pay at least $1.2 billion to purchase a stake of 25% in
Israel's giant Leviathan offshore gas field, the company confirmed Friday.

Woodside has settled on a new deal with the Leviathan partners, after first agreeing in December 2012
to pay $1.25 billion for a 30% stake in the fields. The agreement contemplates supply of gas from
Leviathan to the domestic market in Israel, exports in the form of LNG and pipeline supply to neighboring
countries.
The other participants in Leviathan are Noble Energy, Delek Drilling, Avner Oil Exploration and Ratio Oil
Exploration.

The companies have now agreed to convert the previous in-principle agreement into a non-binding
memorandum of understanding. They plan to negotiate toward executing a fully termed agreement by
March 27, 2014, Woodside said.

Under the new deal, Woodside would still be the operator of any LNG development at Leviathan. Noble
is to remain as upstream operator.
Noble has estimated Leviathan contains 18.9 Tcf of gas and 34.1 million barrels of condensate.
Woodside said the original agreement had been based on an estimated resource for the field of 17 Tcf.
The terms of the agreement provide for a payment of $850 million on completion of the transaction, and
a payment of $350 million on a final investment decision for an LNG development or payments of up to
$350 million on pre-determined export project milestones. Woodside would also pay 5.75% of its
wellhead export gas revenue, commencing after at least 2 Tcf have been exported from the field, capped
at $1.3 billion.
In addition, a royalty of 2.5% would be payable on commercial oil production from a deep Mesozoic
prospect in the Mesozoic. There would also be a one-off payment of $50 million if, after 4 Tcf of gas has
been produced, the total resource is estimated to be at least 20 Tcf.
"The acquisition price at $0.25/Mcf ($1.50/barrel of oil equivalent) appears attractive compared with
recent similar LNG related transactions, although it is slightly higher than the initial price of $0.24/Mcf set
by the previous in-principle agreement," Hong Kong-based analysts with Bernstein Research said in a
note.

"Leviathan will be initially developed as a domestic gas project with gross production of 800,000 Mcf/d
and first gas expected in 2017," the analysts added. "We expect the domestic phase of the Leviathan
field will be sanctioned by the end of 2014."
Bernstein estimated the cost of the domestic gas development at $2.9 billion for 5 Tcf of reserves. The
implied development cost of $0.58/Mcf "looks attractive" compared with the analysts' expectations of
domestic gas prices of between $5 and $8.5/Mcf.

"In addition to domestic gas, there will be up to 9 Tcf of gas exports," Bernstein said. "Although it remains
uncertain whether gas exports will be as LNG or pipeline, Woodside's involvement increases the

supporting two LNG trains," the company said.
"We believe the partners will focus initially on a 4 million mt/year FLNG project with potential FID in 2016
and first gas in 2020. Alternatively, there are regional pipeline options to Turkey, Cyprus and Egypt,
although these have higher geopolitical risks," Bernstein added.

Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said the MOU provided a potential commercial outcome with "compelling
value."
Noble Energy Chairman and CEO Charles Davidson welcomed the deal with Woodside, which is an
experienced LNG project operator. "Their addition to the project will result in substantial added value
while also bringing us much closer to when we will be able to sanction Leviathan for development," he
said.

Following completion of the transaction, working interests in the Leviathan project will be Noble (30%),
Delek (16.94%), Avner (16.94%), Woodside (25%), and Ratio Oil (11.12%).
