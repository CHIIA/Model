Here they are, the Top 25 most expensive homes sold in Sydney so far this year WORTH close to
$200 million in total, they are the stunning homes of Sydney’s elite.

confidence in the economy, the slipping Aussie dollar and the recent change of government. Suburb
records were broken and some extraordinary commissions changed hands as the harbour city’s big
spenders, as well as some well-heeled out-of-towners, rediscovered their cheque books to splash out.
