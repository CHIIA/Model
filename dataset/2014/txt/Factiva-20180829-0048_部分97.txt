Fresh bread claim Supermarket giant Coles is facing more than $3 million in fines for misleading
customers over the freshness of its bread. The Federal Court agreed with the consumer watchdog
that Coles falsely advertised precooked bread as freshly baked. Bread advertised as “fresh, baked
today and sold today” included one product from Ireland first baked months earlier.
Takeover rejected Mining contractor Mineral Resources has failed in a bid to take control of iron ore
explorer Aquila Resources. Mineral Resources bought a near 13 per cent stake in Aquila Resources
last week.

Aquila is already the target of a $1.4 billion cash takeover bid from Chinese steelmaker Baosteel
and rail operator Aurizon.

Aquila said yesterday it had rejected Mineral Resources’ takeover offer.
Newcrest fined Australia’s largest gold miner Newcrest Mining has been fined $1.2 million by the
corporate regulator over its 2013 mass writedowns.
The action relates to a series of broker downgrades before the company announced a series of job
cuts, production downgrades and $6 billion in impairments.

Economy to slow There is further evidence the Australian economy will slow later this year, due to
falling commodity prices, a high dollar and weak consumer confidence.The Westpac/Melbourne
Institute Leading Index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into
the future, rose in May but remains at a level low enough to indicate a below-trend rate of economic
growth this year.
