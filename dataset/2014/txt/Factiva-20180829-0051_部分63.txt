Vale SA's planned closure of its Integra coal mine complex in New South Wales' Hunter Valley could cost
the global miner A$63 million in canceled contracts, Australian Mining reported June 2, citing the
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, or CFMEU.

Vale is planning to place the Integra complex into care and maintenance as the operation is not
economically feasible under current market conditions, a move which is expected to impact about 500
coal mining jobs.

Canceling the coal contract itself will cost Vale A$33 million in penalties, according to Peter Jordan,
district president of the CFMEU, while canceling the port and rail access contracts would add another
A$30 million.
The A$63 million figure for canceling these contracts has been fuelling rumors that Vale has sold the
coal mine complex.
"We are hearing reports that the open cut mine has been sold to a Chinese company, the Shenhua
Group who are involved in the Watermark project near Gunnedah and the closure is just about changing
the workforce arrangements," Jordan said.
The trade union district president, while also noting that Vale has vehemently denied the rumored sale,
expects Integra to be shut down by June 28 upon completion of contract work to remove the longwall and
other equipment.
