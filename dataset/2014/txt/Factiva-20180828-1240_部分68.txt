CLOSES HIGHER DESPITE "BHP EFFECT" ON STRONG VOL/SWITCHING OUT OF BONDS!

Our market closed up 10.8 points to 5634.6, to a new six year record high, just 1.7 points ahead of the
previous six year record high of July 31 - on strong volume worth $4.9 billion. There was also evidence
of investors hopping out of bonds into dividend paying stocks - bond yields shot up 10 points to 3.44%.
The $A fell further, to 92.81US c down 45 points from last evening, likely to be on overseas selling of
BHP - which accounted for 17.9 negative points on the index.

*The star today was Wesfarmers after announcing a strong result and a full year dividend, a special 10c
dividend both fully franked and a $1 per share proposed buyback.

Of some 40 companies reporting their results today there were 19 higher and 18 down - 2 were
suspended for placements - not as positive a reception as yesterday's (15 up, 6 down and one
suspended).
The much awaited HSBC/Markit flash China Manufacturing PMI has not yet been reported.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was up 30 points to 15,460 points, Shanghai CSI physical was up
0.04 points to 2245.37, Hang Seng futures was up 8 points to 25,115 points. S&P futures was down 1.10
points to 1976.10, Nasdaq futures was down 1.25 points to 4033 points, Dow futures wa down 6 points to
16,875 points.
Gold futures were up $1 to $1296. Crude futures were up 90c to $95.38.
