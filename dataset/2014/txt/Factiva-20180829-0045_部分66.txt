MOSCOW, Jul 1 (PRIME) -- Australia’s Norton Gold Fields, which is a subsidiary of Chinese mining
corporation Zijin Mining Group, boosted its stake in Australia’s Bullabulling Gold Ltd to 41.35% from
19.8% earlier as a deadline of the increased offer expires, Norton said in a statement Tuesday.
The company said that the final price of 8 Australian cents per share will remain until the expiration of
the off-the-market offer to acquire all of the shares of Bullabulling on July 16. It added that there will be
no further increases.

Norton considers that it is likely that a significant proportion of Bullabulling’s remaining shareholders will
now also accept the offer. As such, Norton considers that there is a real risk that shareholders who do
not accept the offer may become minority shareholders in a company that is controlled by Norton.
The company also said that Bullabulling shareholders will be subject to dilution as Bullabulling requires
significant funding to complete the definitive feasibility study on the Bullabulling gold project. Norton
also reiterated that it is likely that following the end of the offer period Bullabulling’s share price may
decline back to pre-announcement level.
Bullabulling Gold’s major asset is a project with the same name in Western Australia with JORC
resources of 3.753 million ounces of gold. It has a capital expenditure requirement of more than 300
million Australian dollars to bring it to production.
Norton Gold Fields is one of Australia’s largest domestic gold producers, with annual production of
more than 170,000 ounces. The company has a mining and processing complex in Western
Australia’s world-class Kalgoorlie gold region, including a prospective tenement package surrounding
the Paddington mill.
