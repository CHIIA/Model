A CHINESE private equity company is buying a 15 per cent stake in Paladin Energy as part of a
$205 million capital raising by the Australian uranium miner.
HOPU will spend $61 million on its stake in Paladin as the miner takes action to help shore up its
balance sheet.

The Foreign Investment Review Board has given the go-ahead for the Chinese investor to own just
under a fifth of Paladin’s shares.

Under existing listing rules on the Australian sharemarket, stakeholders can be compelled to launch
a full takeover bid upon amassing a holding of more than 19.9 per cent.
Paladin is also trying to raise $144 million from existing investors through a non-renounceable
entitlement share offer. Chief executive John Borshoff said HOPU would be a long-term strategic
investment partner.Paladin shares have been placed into a two-day trading halt during its capital
raising.
