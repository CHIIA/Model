Today's been a lousy day for Cliffs Natural Resources ( CLF).
It's shares have dropped 4.7% to $17.78 at 2:31 p.m. today, joining a selloff that has caused Rio Tinto (
RIO) to fall 2.4% to $52.11, BHP Billiton ( BHP) to decline 2.8% to $64.82 and Vale ( VALE) to drop 3.2%
to $12.62.

The reason: China's export data was tres terrible and commodity prices have dropped across the board--
especially iron ore. And the one thing Cliffs Natural resources can't afford is lower prices for iron ore.

Axiom Capital's Gordon Johnson and James Bardowski explain why:
In summary, given our view on 2014 iron ore prices, we believe [Cliffs Natural Resources] will likely blow
through its debt covenants in 2014, further cut its dividend, and likely need to do a very large dilutive
equity deal (if the company is not able to execute these options, we see acute liquidity risk in the offing).
While we recognize [Cliffs Natural Resources] has recently replaced its senior management team
(CEO/Chairman & CFO), providing a new, more risk-averse approach to allocating capital, given our view
on iron ore prices (anchored by what we see as structurally slower growth in China), we view the issues
plaguing the company currently as structural. While we see a turnaround as possible, $114 iron ore
suggests bankruptcy is a growing reality, inspiring our report's title "Living On A Prayer".

The sad thing is that it didn't have to be this way, Johnson and Bardowski say. Cliffs Natural Resources
once had a steady business selling iron to non-coastal companies but wanted to get in on the China
play. So it purchased other mines, culminating in the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. Now it's
paying for it.

Shares of Cliffs Natural Resources have plunged 32% so far this year, while Rio Tinto has fallen 7.7%,
BHP Billiton has dropped 4.9% and Vale has declined 17%.
