The Platts daily Australian alumina assessment was again static at $319/mt FOB on April 1, as
participants await the results of the India's Nalco alumina sale tender, which is due to close on April 2.
The outlook for alumina remains bleak, but the price may find momentary support, consumer and trade
sources said. So far, smelter curtailments and closures have been less than capacity expansions in the
West, and smelters across China will still continue to need cargoes, sources said.

However, continued weak domestic aluminum prices in China have put downward pressure on
loss-making smelters and more curtailments are expected in the coming months, sources said.
"The market is oversupplied in alumina globally; any smelter curtailments should make alumina even
longer," a Western trader said.

Meanwhile, Brazil's Para State Environmental Secreteriate, or SEMA, has suspended the Alunorte
refinery's environmental operational license for loading alumina at the Vila do Conde port as of April 1,
Norsk Hydro, majority shareholder of Alunorte, said on April 1. Production of alumina at the 6.3 million
mt/year refinery was, however, unaffected, the Norwegian company said in a statement.

The impact on Australian prices is not yet apparent, as it depends on how fast a resolution is reached
between the two parties, the Western trader said.
The Platts daily assessment for Handysize alumina freight from Western Australia to northeastern
China fell $1 to $25/mt, basis 30,000 mt cargoes for May loadings. A Chinese consumer/trader
reported fixing a larger 35,000 mt parcel for a first-half May shipment from Western Australia to
Lianyungang at $24/mt on April 1, while two shipowners quoted a freight rate of $25.50/mt.

Shipping sources said the freight market had weakened this week as there appeared to be little in the
way of fixtures from Australia for Handysize ships and vessels were readily available along the Western
Australia coast.
The Platts daily China alumina assessment for Henan province was unchanged at Yuan 2,480/mt
($403) ex-works for 70:30 cash and credit payment terms on April 1.

"Prices in Henan have stabilized for the time being, as buyers are taking delivery of parcels and sellers'
inventories are running thin," a Henan smelter said.

The front-month April aluminum contract on the SHFE closed at Yuan 12,830/mt at the end of last
week, up from Yuan 12,705/mt on March 20, but down from Yuan 13,275/mt on February 28.
