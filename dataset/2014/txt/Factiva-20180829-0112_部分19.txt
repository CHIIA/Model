Our market volumes are thinner, expected to be more so tomorrow as many investors begin their Easter
break early. If anything can be read into price action this morning, investors seem to have gravitated to
safe sector stocks today.

"Support is at 5360, resistance at 5400. I will call us up 5 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "Nasdaq again tested support levels last night but
bounced back up which was good to see, indicating the break through support was a false break. But we
need to see 4055 broken this week otherwise it is looking a bit susceptible. Ideally we would want to see it
back above 4150.

"The S&P so far for the week following the break of the 1830 support level had a good close last night,
closing not far off its highs. It is still short term neutral. For the week we would want to see it back above
1860 which would see it close above the 20 day moving average.

"Shanghai closed off a bit yesterday but is still holding above the 2100 level, which we need to see it hold
for now.

Page55of259©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Commodities got whacked last night with copper in a bit of a sell off on Comex to below $3/lb, slightly
bearish for the week. Support is still around $2.94/lb. We would want to see it back above $3.03/lb on the
week, otherwise it is susceptible to testing recent lows. The US dollar was strong across the board.
"Gold was hit quite hard last night, it pretty much gapped yesterday and is now below the 20 day moving
average. The uptrend it has been in for the last week or two has been broken. Selling pressure in coming
days may see it head back down to the previous support at $1280.

*The XJO had a pretty good day, closing right on the 20 day moving average. There is again potential for
a false break of the 20 and 50 day moving averages. We would want to see it close above 5388 for the
week. It will run into pretty strong resistance around 5400. If it breaks that level it can go to 5450.

Support is around 5360 which is also support for the day with resistance at 5400.

I will call us up 5 points.

"Resources are going to be weak, but some recovery in high p/e, high momentum stocks can push us
back into positive territory".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 29.3 points to 5388.2 last evening.

Australia iron ore of 163 million tonnes on a 100% basis. Production for the quarter was 147,387Kt, up
23% from the previous corresponding period (pcp) and up 1% from the December quarter.

Year to date production was up 21% to a record 147,387 Kt.
Full year iron ore production guidance: raise by a further 5 million tonnes to 217 million tonnes on a

months, underpinned by a 71% increase at Onshore US.

Full year production guidance: Now expected to be approximately 245 million barrels of oil equivalent (vs
250 million barrels forecast on January 22) after the divestment of Liverpool Bay. The overall reduction in
full year guidance has been mitigated by an increased contribution from higher margin crude and
condensate.

Page58of259©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Copper Production and Guidance: Remains unchanged at 1.7 million tonnes with a strong June 2014
quarter expected. Production for the quarter was down 5% on the pcp to 1,257.1Kt and vs the December

ford.

production was up 4% on the pcp and down 4% on the December quarter.

mixed and sulphide ore of 13,890Mt grading 0.57% Cu (BHP 57.5%).

operational efficiencies.

40%.
Cash on hand was $US1.9 billion at end March.

Forecast production:
Fortescue plans to ship 41.6Mt in the June 2014 quarter to achieve 127Mt in full year 2014. The mining,
rail and port operations have demonstrated the required sprint capacity during the March 2014 quarter to

relative to the December quarter and March 2013 quarter in line with a planned production increase in
2014 as demand recovers and finished goods inventory is drawn down.
