Australia-listed Wesfarmers Ltd.'s chief executive Richard Goyder said the company will remain in the
coal business "for the long run," despite suggesting metallurgical coal prices may decline in the June
quarter, The Sydney Morning Herald reported April 30. The majority of the group's production is met coal.
'We would expect a reduction in metallurgical coal pricing. … A majority of producers would find it very
financially challenging at current pricing," The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Goyder as saying.
However, Wesfarmers, as a low-cost producer, expects to stay afloat until a favorable pricing environment
emerges.

Wesfarmers on April 29 reported strong production results at two of its coal mines in Australia — Curragh
and Bengalla. Wesfarmers, through its subsidiaries, owns a 100% stake in Curragh and 40% in Bengalla.
Wesfarmers said the Curragh coal mine produced 2.4 million tonnes of met coal in the quarter ended
March, compared to 1.5 million tonnes in the year-ago quarter. Thermal coal production at the mine was
830,000 tonnes, up 13.4% from 732,000 tonnes a year ago.

In the three months to March, Wesfarmers' share in Bengalla production totaled 948,000 tonnes, up
34.3% from 706,000 tonnes during the year-ago period.
Goyder's comments on coal prices come at a time when Whitehaven Coal Ltd., another Australian coal
producer, expected met coal prices to remain at US$93/tonne in the June quarter. Whitehaven sold met
coal at an average price of US$100.79/tonne in the March quarter.
Whitehaven also saw a decline in thermal coal prices, reporting an average price of US$75.19/tonne for
the March quarter, down from US$82.28/tonne in the previous quarter. Whitehaven attributed the weak
thermal coal prices to "a well-supplied market with little disruption from weather-related events and a lack
of buying by Chinese coal customers from the seaborne market.'
