WBC/Melb Institute leading index points to sharp slowdown

The run of disappointments for the economy continues with the release this morning of the Westpac
Leading Index of Economic Activity.

Westpac reported:

The six month annualised deviation from trend growth rate of the Westpac Melbourne Institute Leading
Index which indicates the likely pace of economic growth three to nine months into the future fell to
–1.16% in April from +0.03% in March.

Westpac says this is a sharply weaker reading which points to a significant loss of momentum.

The May Leading Index reading is the weakest since late 2011 when the RBA embarked on its latest
interest rate easing cycle. At that time, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis was in full swing and consumer
sentiment had slumped heavily.

The latest decline has also been associated with a sharp fall in consumer sentiment and deteriorating
external conditions including declining commodity prices and slowing growth in US industrial production.

Aristocrat Leisure Ltd for the half year ended March 31 announced net profit after tax was up 9.2% to
$57.379 million on revenue up 7.7% to $409.899 million.

An 8c unfranked dividend was announced, ex date June 2, record date June 4. The DRP will not apply to
this dividend.

Fully diluted EPS was 10.4c vs 9.5c for the previous corresponding period (pcp).

Operating cash flow was $61 million vs $45.6 million for the pcp.
Net debt was $233.7 million up 26.3%.

CO and managing director Jamie Odell said in the report the gains have flowed directly from the rapid
improvements the group is making in its game portfolio, which have been exceptionally well received by
customers and players.

Outlook

The CEO said "Performance will be weighted to the second half, reflecting the carry forward of a higher
gaming operations installed base, strengthening fee per day and the impact of a full pipeline of
compelling new game content".

Analysts expectations: $50.7 mln, div 8c/$57.7 mln, div 7c.

* A leading broker retained an "accumulate" on Aristocrat with a $6.85 price target ahead of its first half
result tomorrow.

At the full year 2013 result Aristocrat had guided for strong NPAT growth in full year 2014 driven by
momentum in the US and share gains in Australia, partly offset by a significant uplift in R&D spend.

The broker said the market will increasingly focus on the second half outlook, with the broker expecting
growth to accelerate 39% in the second half.

There is the possibility of capital management at the full year 2014 result.

fort he 2014/15 season, matching the opening forecast provided 12 months ago at the start of the
2013/14 season.

2014/15 season will be announced in July when Fonterra's budget is completed and approved.

co-op's opening price of the previous season but also reflecting current market conditions. "Our farmers
understand the realities of dairy commodity price cycles and will exercise caution at this early stage in the
season".
CEO Theo Spierings said volatility continues to exert a strong influence over the global outlook for dairy.
There is more milk available for the international market to absorb. Demand from China is expected to
remain strong. In Russia there will be pressure on the balance between imports and local production.

*TAH: Racing Queensland's proposed Race Inf Fees could reduce NPAT by $3m

TABCORP Holdings Ltd announced it has been advised of Racing Queensland's proposed Race
Information Fees for 2014-15. The proposed fees which cover wagering on Queensland thoroughbred,
greyhound and harness racing include totalisator bets at 1.5% of turnover for Standard Meetings and 2%
of turnover for Premium Meetings and non totalisator bets charged at 2.5% of turnover for Standard
Meetings and 3.5% of turnover for Premium Meetings.

There are 81 proposed Premium Meetings in full year 2015 made up of 34 thoroughbred, 18 harness and
29 greyhound meetings. There are 1,549 proposed Standad Meetings in 2015.

Had the proposed fees been applied to TAH's turnover on Queensland racing in full year 2014, and in the
absence of any mitigating strategies the estimated NPAT impact would be approximately $3 million.

Racing Queensland is holding a 28 day consultation period on the proposed fee structure with the new
approval period commencing on July 1.
*WES: Wesfarmers Ltd managing director Richard Goyder in his over view for the group pointed to its
continued strong performance while during the year Wesfarmers also sold its 40% stake in Air Liquide
Wafor $95 million, and insurance underwriting operations and insurance broking and premium funds
have both neen sold, $95 million and $700/750 million due to settle in June.

"The Age" adds, " Wesfarmers boss Richard Goyder said this morning the Perth-based conglomerate
would be ''negligent'' if it didn't eventually make a leap into international markets through an offshore

Page146of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.acquisition but that investors needed to be patient. Mr Goyder said Wesfarmers was continuing to invest
in its newly created business development office in Hong Kong to help the company direct and lay the
ground work an eventual move overseas with the group building its internal capabilities so that when the
right opportunities came along the company had the skills to meet the challenge of an offshore deal.

‘’We have got the people, systems and processes that are capable of delivering value to shareholders
from other jurisdictions,’’ Mr Goyder told analysts.
Mr Goyder said investors shouldn’t be alarmed about an expansion overseas by the Perth-based group
whose origins stretch back to 1914 as a Western Australian farmers’ cooperative. But this was something
that could take years or even decades to occur.

‘’Don’t hold your breath for it to happen but we would be negligent not to do it,'' Mr Goyder said.

Analysts comment: A leading broker yesterday retained an "equal weight" on Wesfarmers with a price
target of $43.
The broker lowered its EBIT estimates for WES Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers business by 1% and
11% for full year 2015 and 2016 saying there was a looming oversupply to ammonium nitrate, where
WES is investing $550 million to construct a third AN plant to expand production by 260,000 tpa to
780,000 tpa, expected to become operational in the 4th quarter 2014.
However the broker added, this equates to less than a 1% cut in WES' group EPS.
The broker forecast NPAT this year of $2.359 billion, rising to $2.706 billion next year.

*WOW/LEP: Considering divestment of pubs, will retain leasehold interest

Woolworths Ltd advised regarding speculation this morning regarding a potential divestment of freehold
property assets of ALH Group, owned 75% by Woolworths (25% by Bruce MathiesonGroup, managed
by LEP), said Woolworths is currently investigating options to divest a further part of its property portfolio
including its property holdings in hotels and co-located retail liquor stores. These options include single
property sales, portfolio property sales and the creation of separate vehicles to own the assets. Any
divestment would involve the relevant Woolworthsgroup business retaining operational control of the
properties through a leasehold interest in the relevant premises.
Since July 1 2010 Woolworths has divested approximately $2 billion of property assets including
Shopping Centres Australasia Property Group in December 2012.
However no decision has been taken on the divestment of property assets in hotels and co-located retail
liquor stores at this stage.

Noni VB Lt announced a s a result of a review by the board the company expects an impairment charge

million, subject to June trading conditions and any final full year audit adjustments. This follows a profit

times facing older Australians.
