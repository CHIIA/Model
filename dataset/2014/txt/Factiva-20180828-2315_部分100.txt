Another record profit from Australia's second-largest bank and more monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan were not enough to buoy the local sharemarket, as Woolworths disappointed investors with its
worst quarterly sales update in more than four years.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each fell 0.4 per cent, on
Monday to 5506.9 points and 5485 points respectively. Woolworths led the bourse lower following a
disappointing sales update, along with Westpac Banking Corporation which fell after it delivered a
full-year profit result in line with forecasts.

Local shares declined despite a strong lead from offshore. Equity markets in the US and around
Europe posted strong gains on Friday night after the Bank of Japan shocked markets with a move to
increase the pace of its quantitative easing to ¥80 trillion ($809 million) per annum, compared to
previous guidance for a maximum of ¥70 trillion. Japanese markets were closed on Monday, but
Nikkei futures were pointing to further strong gains after the benchmark index shot up 4.8 per cent on
Friday.

"The BoJ's decision will increase global liquidity at a time when QE in the US is ending and should be
supportive of global markets, including the ASX," Contango Asset Management portfolio manager
Shawn Burns said.
But some lacklustre company news and disappointing domestic and Chinese economic data meant
the local market got little benefit from the positive sentiment about Japan's expansionary monetary
policy on Monday. Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed building approvals dived 11 per cent in
September, against expectations for a 1 per cent fall.

"A drop of 11 per cent in September is clearly a concern, however month to month data is extremely
volatile," Asenna Wealth Solutions senior trader Assad Tannous said.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep rates on hold at their record-low 2.5 per cent when
the board meets on Tuesday. A swag of private economic surveys  indicated house price growth is
moderating, the labour market is strengthening and inflation is edging up.Not great for banksWestpac
Banking Corporation dropped 0.7 per cent to $34.55 as it reported a 8 per cent jump in net profit for
the 12 months to September 30 to $7.6 billion.

Westpac lifted its full-year dividend from 88¢ to 92¢ per share, fully franked. Credit Suisse analysts
called the result "marginally disappointing".

ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank both delivered annual results in line with forecasts
last week. On Monday ANZ added 0.2 per cent to $33.58, while NAB fell 0.3 per cent to $34.89.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia edged up 0.1 per cent to $80.52. CBA boss Ian Narev has
volunteered to testify at a Senate Inquiry into the bank's financial advice scandal.

just 3 per cent, the slowest quarterly rate in more than four years.

Main rival Wesfarmers, owner of Bunnings and Coles, edged up 1¢ to $44.15. Telstra Corporation
lifted 0.7 per cent to $5.67. Brambles rose 0.7 per cent to $9.60 as the logistics group reported a 6 per
cent rise in sales for the September quarter and raised its full-year earnings guidance.
In China, National Bureau of Statistics data showed the non-manufacturing purchasing managers'
index (PMI) fell 1.2 per cent in October to a nine-month low at 53.8 points.
China's official manufacturing PMI for October released over the weekend came in at 50.8 points,
missing median forecasts for a reading of 51.2 points. The final HSBC/Markit China Manufacturing
PMI, released on Monday, edged up to 50.4 in October, unchanged from a preliminary reading.
The spot price for iron ore, landed in China, was down 0.3 per cent to $US79.59 a tonne, with futures
trading pointing to another fall overnight.

Resources giant BHP Billiton lost 0.7 per cent to $33.71, while main rival Rio Tinto dropped 1 per cent
to $59.78.
Gold producer Newcrest Mining lost 7.6 per cent to $8.61, after the price of bullion plunged more than
2 per cent to a new four-year low on Friday.
"Gold stocks fell heavily after the spot price broke though major technical support on Friday night and
pushing into new five-year lows, Mr Tannous said. When the ASX closed gold was fetching
$US1169.17 per ounce.

Liquified Natural Gas was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 5.4 per cent to $3.92, as
it upped production targets.
