A CHINESE investor has struck a $4 million-plus deal to buy a commercial building on
Coolangatta’s main street.
The fully tenanted Griffith Plaza has been sold by receivers from PPB Advisory. It sits on a 1386sq m
island site at 152-154 Griffith St and its eight tenancies yield a net $416,203 a year with CPI-indexed
growth.

Industry sources said the property sold on a yield of “circa 9 per cent”. Tenants include restaurants,
beauty services, surf equipment and apparel, and a property services firm.

The average remaining leasing term is more than four years.

Lachlan Harris and Kevin Ramsey, from CBRE, were marketing agents for the asset but declined to
comment.

Griffith Plaza was developed in 2000 by Coolangatta Retail Investments, linked to Melbourne
businessman Warren Thompson, which acquired the site for $870,000.

It underwent a refurbishment in 2012.

The asset has a net lettable area of 824sq m and a 250sq m licensed alfresco area with potential to
strata title and sell.As well as its seven retail businesses at ground level and single office tenancy in a
partial second level, it features basement parking for 26 vehicles.
