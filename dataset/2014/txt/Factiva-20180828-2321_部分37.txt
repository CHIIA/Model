PR Newswire

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 20, 2014
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 20, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) today reported third quarter
2014 revenues of $1.72 billion, leading to Adjusted EBITDA of $216.3 million. Loss from Continuing
Operations totaled $(154.0) million, reflecting the effect of a non-cash tax expense related to the repeal of
the Minerals Resource Rent Tax in Australia, with Diluted Loss Per Share from Continuing Operations of
$(0.58) and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $(0.59).
"In the face of challenging times for the coal industry, Peabody continues to control the controllable and
take the necessary actions to best position the company through strong operating performance, solid
operating cash flows, lower costs and reduced capital targets," said Peabody Energy Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce. "Regarding industry fundamentals, we look forward to greater
realization of announced metallurgical coal supply cutbacks, continued growth in Indian coal imports, and
improving Southern Powder River Basin rail performance to rebuild utility stockpiles and meet strong
underlying demand."
RESULTS FROM PEABODY CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Page100of333©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Third quarter revenues totaled $1.72 billion compared with $1.80 billion in the prior year primarily on lower
realized pricing in Australia. U.S. Mining revenues declined to $1.02 billion, due to lower volumes and
reduced Midwestern revenues per ton. Australian revenues decreased 4 percent as higher volumes partly
offset a 13 percent reduction in revenues per ton. Australian sales totaled 10.0 million tons, including 4.6
million tons of metallurgical coal and 3.4 million tons of seaborne thermal coal.
Adjusted EBITDA of $216.3 million reflects ongoing cost and productivity improvements that mitigated the
impact of approximately $135 million from lower pricing. U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA declined 8 percent
over the prior year to $281.6 million primarily due to rail performance issues in the quarter. Australian
Mining Adjusted EBITDA declined to $16.9 million as a result of lower seaborne coal prices. Australian
costs per ton decreased 6 percent compared with the prior year on improved longwall performance as well
as cost and productivity programs.
Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.3 million and Resource Management Adjusted
EBITDA totaled $3.5 million.
Loss from Continuing Operations totaled $(154.0) million compared to Income from Continuing
Operations of $24.0 million in the prior year. Current quarter results reflect lower tax benefits following the
repeal of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax in Australia, along with lower operating profit resulting from
reduced realized pricing. Diluted Loss from Continuing Operations totaled $(0.58) per share with Adjusted
Diluted EPS of $(0.59).

Third quarter capital spending of $42.8 million was primarily focused on sustaining capital expenditures.
Liquidity totaled $2.3 billion, including more than $465 million of cash. Peabody continues to generate
positive operating cash flows, which totaled $169.8 million during the period.
COAL MARKETS AND PEABODY'S POSITION
"While global coal markets continue to reflect oversupply and concerns over Chinese coal imports, we are
seeing some favorable industry indicators," said Boyce. "India is transitioning to become the
fastest-growing coal importer. More than 20 million of the approximately 30 million tons of announced

Page101of333©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.global metallurgical production cutbacks are yet to be realized. In the United States, while a mild summer
and rail performance impacted volumes and market activity, Southern Powder River Basin customer
stockpiles ended September at a nine-year low, and we anticipate improving logistics and rising volumes in
the Southern Powder River and Illinois basins as we look toward the new year."
Within global coal markets:

-- The fourth quarter metallurgical
coal price benchmark for high-quality

low-vol hard coking coal settled at $119 per tonne ($108 per short ton)
with benchmark low-vol PCI at $99 per tonne ($90 per short ton),
essentially flat with third quarter settlements;

-- China's coal imports have declined in recent months, reflecting coal

import policy uncertainty, stable domestic supply, flat pig iron
production and modest coal generation growth of 1 percent through
August. While China's recent coal import tariffs may dampen near-term
imports, long-term drivers of coal demand remain intact;

-- India's coal generation rose 13 percent through the first nine months,
and demand for thermal coal imports accelerated by more than 55 percent
in September to a new monthly record as India's coal stockpiles reached a
25-year low and more than half of India's power plants reported
critically low coal inventories.
percent through September as India continues to access the high-quality
seaborne market. Coal quality concerns, domestic production shortages
and strong demand support further coal import growth; and

Metallurgical coal imports rose 23

-- Global seaborne coal markets remain challenged, yet supply growth is set

to moderate as production cuts are implemented. China has announced
nearly 115 million tons of thermal production cutbacks.
coal producers have announced approximately 30 million tons of reductions
this year, with more than 20 million tons yet to be realized in coming
quarters. U.S. coal exports have declined 16 percent through August.

Metallurgical

Based on current global economic growth forecasts, Peabody expects annual global coal demand to rise
550 million tonnes by 2016. Over this same period, approximately 250 gigawatts of new coal-fueled
generation is expected to be built. Seaborne metallurgical coal demand is projected to increase over time,
led by ongoing urbanization and industrialization in China and India.
With solid operating performance to date, the company now targets total 2014 Australian sales of 36 to 38
million tons, including 16 to 17 million tons of metallurgical coal and 12 to 13 million tons of export
thermal coal.
Within U.S. coal markets:

--

Coal generation increased 3 percent through September, while natural gas

generation declined 2 percent.
electricity generation in the U.S., and 2014 coal consumption is expected
to rise approximately 15 million tons over 2013 levels;

Coal accounts for 41 percent of

-- Southern Powder River Basin stockpiles are at their lowest level since

2005 despite summer temperatures that were 8 percent below normal in coal
heavy regions. Stockpiles are expected to end the year at less than 40
days of supply, a decline of more than 30 percent from the beginning of
2014, on increased demand and rail performance issues;

-- Rail performance has led to greater coal conservation measures at certain

utilities, but shipments are expected to improve through 2015 and into
2016 on record capital spending by rail carriers.
Absent anticipated

Page102of333©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.rail constraint, it is estimated that Southern Powder River Basin
shipments would need to increase by approximately 50 to 60 million tons
in order to rebuild stockpiles to normal levels and meet rising utility
demand; and

-- Peabody finalized a 6-year, 40 million ton coal supply agreement in the
third quarter, and anticipates 2015 Powder River Basin revenues per ton
to be higher than 2014 realizations due to strong contracting strategies
built on layering in sales over time.
Traded markets have been impacted
by extremely low liquidity and reflect lower pricing than we have
observed in the physical market.

Peabody's projected 2014 U.S. production is essentially fully priced, with 2015 production approximately 15
percent unpriced and 2016 production 50 to 60 percent unpriced based on expected 2014 levels.

OPERATIONAL AND CAPITAL UPDATE
20 Oct 2014 08:00 ET Press Release: Peabody Energy Announces Results -2-

Based on strong capital efficiency to date, Peabody is again reducing 2014 capital spending targets to $200
to $220 million, which is well below 2013 levels with spending primarily focused on sustaining capital. The
company is well positioned due to previous investments in our operations, which enables low capital
spending levels for several years. Peabody continues to leverage operational improvements and is
advancing further cost reduction efforts to maximize cash flows, including additional spending reviews
across the organization.

Operational initiatives are focused on:

-- Improving yields, increasing automation and optimizing production of the

coal caving system at the North Goonyella Mine, where

longwall top
production has increased more than 55 percent over the second quarter;
-- Leveraging the benefits of the Moorvale Mine owner-operator transition

completed in the third quarter.
is now under the owner-operator model, which continues to provide
additional cost savings at converted mines; and

Over 95 percent of Australian production

-- Advancing the Gateway North extension in Illinois to replace the

depleting reserves. Slope development is ahead of schedule, and the
project is maximizing use of existing equipment and infrastructure to
limit capital requirements.
Ramp up is expected to begin in the first
half of 2015.

OUTLOOK
Peabody is targeting full-year 2014 Adjusted EBITDA of $765 million to $815 million and Adjusted Diluted
EPS of $(1.48) to $(1.38), excluding any charges related to implementation of an organizational
restructuring program that was recently launched. Targets reflect lower seaborne thermal coal pricing and
reduced production at the Wilpinjong Mine as strong year-to-date performance is expected to result in the
mine reaching annual permit levels before year end.

Additional full-year 2014 targets include:

-- Total sales of 245 to 255

million tons, including U.S. sales of 185 to

190 million tons and Australian sales of 36 to 38 million tons;

-- U.S. costs per ton 1 to 3 percent below 2013 levels on cost containment

efforts. U.S. revenues per ton improved to 2 to 4 percent below 2013
levels on higher realized price per ton; and

-- Australian costs that have been lowered to approximately $70 per ton, as

a result of successful cost reduction initiatives and operating
performance.

effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates (primarily the Australian dollar); effects of
acquisitions or divestitures; economic strength and political stability of countries in which the company has
operations or serves customers; legislation, regulations and court decisions or other government actions,
including, but not limited to, new environmental and mine safety requirements; changes in income tax
regulations, sales-related royalties, or other regulatory taxes and changes in derivative laws and
regulations; litigation, including claims not yet asserted; and other risks detailed in the company's reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Included in the company's release of financial information accounted for in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are certain non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by SEC
regulations. The company has defined below the non-GAAP financial measures that are used and has
included in the tables following this release reconciliations of these measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as (loss) income from continuing operations before deducting net interest
expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization,
asset impairment and mine closure costs, charges for the settlement of claims and litigation related to
previously divested operations and amortization of basis difference associated with equity affiliates.
Adjusted EBITDA, which is not calculated identically by all companies, is not a substitute for operating
income, net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with United States GAAP. Management
uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary metric to measure segment operating performance and also believes
it is useful to investors in comparing the company's current results with those of prior and future periods
and in evaluating the company's operating performance without regard to its capital structure or the cost
basis of its assets.
Adjusted (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS are defined as (loss)
income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations,
respectively, excluding the impacts of asset impairment and mine closure costs and charges for the
settlement of claims and litigation related to previously divested operations, net of tax, and the
remeasurement of foreign income tax accounts on the company's income tax provision. The company
calculates income tax benefits related to asset impairment and mine closure costs and charges for the
settlement of claims and litigation related to previously divested operations based on the enacted tax rate
in the jurisdiction in which they have been or will be realized, adjusted for the estimated recoverability of
those benefits. Management has included these measures because, in the opinion of management,
excluding those foregoing items is useful in comparing the company's current results with those of prior
and future periods. Management also believes that excluding the impact of the remeasurement of foreign
income tax accounts represents a meaningful indicator of the company's ongoing effective tax rate.
