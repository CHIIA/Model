U.S. stocks gained ground for the first time in four sessions, led by strength in the recently hard-hit
Nasdaq Composite Index, as investors braced for the start of earnings season.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 10.27 points, or 0.1%, to 16256.14. The Dow was down
as much as 65.59 points, and up as much as 50.99 points, at its intraday extremes.

The S&P 500 index gained 6.92 points, or 0.4%, to 1851.96, while the technology-oriented Nasdaq
Composite climbed 33.23 points, or 0.8%, to 4112.99.

The Nasdaq had been hit particularly hard recently amid sharp declines in previously highflying
technology and biotechnology stocks. The index lost 4.6% over the previous three sessions--the
biggest three-day percentage decline since November 2011.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 327.13 points, or 2%, over the previous three sessions.

The market's recent weakness stemmed from concerns over valuations ahead of what is expected to
be a lackluster first-quarter earnings season, traders and strategists said.

First-quarter earnings among companies in the S&P 500 are expected to decline 1.3% from a year
earlier as of Tuesday, according to consensus analyst estimates compiled by FactSet. A drop would
mark only the second year-over-year decline in earnings since the financial crisis.

"We've seen expectations for earnings growth wane, and that's been weighing on sentiment," said
Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which has $115 billion in
assets under management. He said that sets up overall results to exceed expectations.

"In part because the bar is low, the bias is to the upside," Mr. Sandven said.
Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., which oversees $105 billion in client
assets, said investor expectations toward earnings "are so low, and declining every day, that it shouldn't
be too difficult" for overall results to beat forecasts.

Alcoa Inc. unofficially kicked off earnings season when it reported after Tuesday's closing bell
first-quarter adjusted earnings per share that exceeded analyst estimates. The aluminum company's
stock closed Tuesday up 0.5%, then rose another 2.2% in after-hours trading.

"This is the day the market has been waiting for," said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at
broker-dealer LPL Financial. "This may not be a great quarter" for earnings, he said, but outlooks for
the second quarter "could surprise to the upside" as companies likely saw business improve, along with
the weather, at the end of the first quarter.

Despite the recent volatility in stocks, the S&P 500 was still up 0.2% on the year, while the Nasdaq was
down just 1.5%.

fair, "the fundamental backdrop is still favorable for stocks to continue to trend higher," U.S. Bank's Mr.
Sandven said. "I like the risk-versus-reward [outlook for stocks] at these levels."

With no major economic data released Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note inched lower,
to 2.681% from 2.695% late Monday. Gold futures rose 0.8% to settle at $1,308.70 an ounce.
Crude-oil futures climbed 2.1%, to $102.56 a barrel, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration
lowered its forecasts for U.S. oil-production growth in 2014 and 2015.

The dollar declined against the euro and the yen.

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.3%, after falling 1.2% on Monday to snap a nine-session win
streak.
Asian markets showed no real direction, as Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slid 1.4% while China's
Shanghai Composite climbed 1.9%.
In corporate news, Tesla Motors rallied 3.8% after the company said it started offering a business
leasing program for its small and medium-size business customers, which allows them to deduct the
payments from their business taxes.

Tesla was among the recent highfliers hit hard over the past month amid worries over valuation. The
stock has lost 12% over the last month, but was still up 43% since the start of the year.
Elsewhere, the U.S.-listed shares of Finnish mobile-phone company Nokia rallied 5% after it received
Chinese regulatory approval for the sale of its handset business to Microsoft. Shares of Dow
component Microsoft tacked on 0.1%.
