resources contributed 14.6 positive points, property trusts contributed 0.4 negative points, retailers

*JP Morgan's positive call on miners last night and takeover activity in our market oday - rejected takeover
offer for PanAust, Northern Star acquisition of Jundee from Newmont, Aurora offer lifted by Baytex - took
our market briefly over the 5000 mark before settling just below it - apparently shaking off the Budget
blues.

However, there is just a chance today has been a "bear trap".

*Short covering in the miners would have played a part in the rise - and tomorrow Macquarie, NAB and
Westpac go ex div and we will also have the outcome of the Budget.
China eco news
*China's Industrial Production in April fell to 8.7% from 8.8% and vs 8.9% expected.

*Retail sales rose an annual 11.9% vs a Reuters forecast of 12.2% while fixed asset investment grew
17.3% in the first four months from a year earlier, against a 17.7% rise expected.
*China's central bank has asked commercial banks to quicken the pace of extending home mortgages
and to set mortgage rates at reasonable levels, underlining efforts to support the cooling property market,
Reuters writes quoting four unnamed sources.
The sources said the request came at a meeting between the People's Bank of China and some
commercial banks on Monday.

On the other hand, there was some genuine, albeit tentative good news in the Ukraine which could see
markets rise sharply tonight (more in "News of the Day" below).

today.

"Over in the US, index leadership is bearish. While the S&P 500 and Dow Jones were able to print new
highs or at least new closing highs, the tech heavy NASDAQ and small-cap Russell 2000 are well of the
pace.

"It is not a sign of a healthy market when growth and risk are underperforming.

"If markets are on the cusp of tracing out important highs, volatility needs to pick up. "As a result, I am
looking for some decent downside over the next one to two weeks. But none of this matters for today.

"The ceiling will be 5477. The floor will be 5432. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5455, up 6.6 points'..

NEWS OF THE DAY

Encouraging news on Ukraine situation

Handelsblatt reports this afternoon the mediation efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) has raised hopes for a peaceful solution. Russian President Vladimir Putin has pledged
his support for the mediation initiative in a telephone conversation with the OSCE Chairman Didier
Burkhalter, the organization said on Monday. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) set
off for Kiev on Tuesday morning from Berlin.

According to the OSCE, the plan provides a "pragmatic" transition from the "logic of escalation" to a "logic
of cooperation".
"Whether the negotiations will lead to a success, however, is in the stars' Handelsblatt commented - at
least the referendum has been concluded without any violence.

*ALZ: Secures 2 development sites, in Burwood, Melb and in Botany Bay
Australand announced it has secured a 20.5 hectare residential infill site in Burwood East, Melbourne
and a 4.1 hectare residential infill site in Botany, Sydney for the combined development of over 1,200
dwellings. The two projects are estimated to have an end value of approximately $850 million.
The Burwood site is situated just 800m from the group's recently completed Burwood project consisting
of the development of 240 medium density dwellings and apartments. The project is subject to planning
approvals, but is expected to offer a variety of housing solutions, delivering earnings from 2016.

*CAB: ComfortDelGro profit falls in 1st qtr, CityFleet barely profitable

Cabcharge Australia Ltd announced the first quarter results of associate entities ComfortDelGro
Cabcharge Pty Ltd and CityFleet Group.
Results for ComfortDelGro (CDC) for the first quarter ended March 31 included turnover of $80.7 million,
down 11.9% or $10.9 million over the previous corresponding period (pcp). EBIT was $14.2 million,
down 12.3% or $2m over the same period.

The decrease of the business volume at CDC was due to the expiry of the NSW Metropolitan Bus Service
Contracts for Regions 1 and 3 in October 2013 offset in part by Eastrans (formerly Driver Group) in
Melbourne, acquired in July 2013 and from increases of existing bus services.
CityFleet Group in the UK had turnover up 18.3% to $25.9 million vs the pcp. EBIT fell 26% to $600,000.

The UK operation remains profitable but revenue growth continues to be constrained by the lower
corporate and Taxicard bookings. During the first quarter both turnover and EBIT of the UK operation
benefited from currency translation.

NTA backing per security is $NZ1.37 vs $NZ1.16 for the previous year.

Basic and diluted eps is 34.4NZ c vs 0.6NZ c for the previous year.

EBITDA was 5% below the prior year mainly on Trustpower's lower level of New Zealand hydro
generation and soft wholesale prices, weakness in the $A impacting the reported IEA result and a lower
contribution from NZ Bus.

EBITDAF was down 6% to $NZ277 due to a combination of dry weather reducing Trustpower's hydro
generation while wholesale energy prices were depressed by overall generation over supply.

Page24of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Australian generation was up 11GWh at Snowtown Stage 1 and 139GWh was produced from Snowtown
Stage 2 turbines as the project starts to become operational.
Infratil Energy AustraliaGroup (LUMO, IEA, Perth Energy) had EBITDAF of $A69, a strong underlying
result for the period, down on $A8 million for the prior year but $A7 million occurred in the first half and
mainly reflected a lower contribution from generating activities.

NZ Bus made steady progress, over the year 135 new buses were introduced bringing the fleet to 345
now operated in Auckland and Wellington.

Wellington Airport met its earnings budget but experienced modest passenger growth.
Z Energy produced a net profit of $NZ95 million for the year ended March 31 2014 and replacement cost

trends and Infratil is well placed in each sector".

*ORI: Int down 7.8%, div 40c part fr, DRP at no disc/full yr flat or up on 2013

Orica Ltd for the half year ended March 31 2014 announced a net profit after tax down 7.8% to $242.1
million on revenue up 1% to $3.357.3 billion.

A 40c interim dividend franked to 16c was announced vs 39c for the previous corresponding period (pcp).

NTA backing per security is 440.9c vs 303.5c for the pcp.

Basic eps is 66c vs 72.4c for the pcp.

Diluted eps is 65.9c vs 72.3c for the pcp.
The company said in the presentation the result is in line with the update provided in March indicating
first half profit in 2014 would be less than the first half 2013.

Outlook
Group net profit after tax before individually material items in 2014 is expected to be in line with or exceed
the restated full year 2013 NPAT of $592.5 million influenced by improved expectations for mining
services in the second half full year 2014 on improving volumes vs the 2nd half 2013 in most markets
while current pricing pressure is expected to continue with challenging ground support markets.

Expectations for chemicals in the 2nd half for volume improvements and resolution of customer
operational issues while watercare and caustic soda contributions are expected to remain flat.

Analysts expectations: $239 mln, div 38.9c.

*The Financial Times reports as of May 9 2014 the consensus forecast amongst 25 polled investment
analysts covering Orica Ltd advises that the company will outperform the market. This has been the
consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts improved on May 29, 2011. The previous
consensus forecast advised investors to hold their position in Orica Ltd. There were 5 "buy"
recommendations, 7 "outperforms', 8 "holds', 1 "underperform" and 1 'sell".

Page25of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On May 12 a leading broker retained a "hold" on Orica ahead of its results tomorrow expecting a 4%
decrease in EBIT to $422 million, a 7% decrease in net profit before significant items, and $249 million
pre significant items (vs guidance of $267 million) and a 37c dividend.

The broker said the stock remains expensive, with concerns around subdued explosives demand, the
impact of Chinese imports on Indonesian margins and risks to manufacturing margins at Kooragang
Island.

The broker also expects potential deterioration of returns from Minova in the longer term due to a variety
of factors.

*On March 26 a leading broker retained an "underweight" for Orica with a target price of $22.07 after
Orica, presenting at an investor conference, maintained full year guidance for NPAT growth in 2014 vs
2013 however they flagged NPAT in the first half is expected to be down due to "market demand and
weather".

The broker said although the extent of weakness implied in first half 2014 would suggest similar leverage
to that in the second half of 2012, that had been sufficient to meet consensus expectations this year, a
first half 2014 decline of 3% implies full year 2014 NPAT of $613 million, down 7% on consensus and
down 1% on the broker's forecast, but still within guidance growth for 2014.

The broker pointed to its March 13 major Australia Chemicals note, when it moved Orica to "underweight"
- the only underweight on the Street, the broker said.

ORI down 85 cents to $21.09

*RHC: Ramsay j/v seeks to acquire balance of Generale de Sante for Euro 539m

*NST: Buys Jundee from Newmont for $A82.5m cash/now 2nd largest in Aust

Page26of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Northern Star Ltd announced it has agreed to purchase the iconic Jundee Gold Mine in Western
Australia from Newmont Mining for $82.5 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to lift Northern
Star's production from 350,000 ozs pa to 550,000 oz pa in 2015, making it the second largest ASX listed
gold miner.
Northern Star will fund the acquisition with cash reserves and an increased debt facility.

Junee's all in sustaining cost in full year 2013 was $A930/oz. Jundee's reserves stand at 411,000 ozs at
4.3gpt Au and resources at 507,000 ozs at 4.4gpt Au with outstanding potential to grow inventory through
in and near mine exploration.
NST expects the acquisition will lift its group production to 550,000 ozs p.a. at an all in sustaining cost of
$A1,050/oz, delivering additional scale and diversity.
Northern Star managing director Bill Beament said Jundee would immediately increase the company's
free cash flow and has strong potential to increase reserves and resources via exploration at and around
the mine.

He said with five operating mines generating 550,000 ozs p.a., Northern Star would meet the key criteria
of global investors. "The international funds have made it abundantly clear that they want to invest in gold
mining companies with a diversified production base and economies of scale that enable costs to be kept
as low as possible. The Jundee acquisition means Northern Star will tick all these boxes while still
enjoying a conservative balance sheet and outstanding potential for growth through exploration at each of
its five operating mines.

*ABV: Modified SIBS waste truck brake for commercial trailers

Advanced Braking Technology Ltd announced it has been assigned an Australian licensing approval
number for the installation of SIBS wet brake technology onto trailers used in the heavy truck market. ABV
expects final approval and documentation to be issued shortly.

The major components of the SIBS waste truck brake have been used to create a complementary product
to address the brake wear issues seen in the road train market. The first of these simplified brakes is
currently being prepared for operation in the Pilbara region of WA in a fuel tanker fleet.

The extensive development and validation already completed on the SIBS waste truck brake has resulted
in a greatly reduced effort required to commercialise the trailer brake. This simplified trailer brake opens
up a significantly larger market, with over 7000 trailers being produced each year in Australia.
