Local shares finished higher on Tuesday despite falls among mining stocks and a disappointing start
to company reporting season.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 36.5 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 5331.5 as heavy falls
among resources companies were outweighed by gains in the finance sector.

The broader All Ordinaries Index also added 0.7 per cent.
Local shares received little guidance from overseas at the open as United States equity markets
were closed on Monday night due to the Martin Luther King Jr holiday. Major markets around Asia
provided positive leads on Tuesday afternoon.

James Packer's casino operator Crown Resorts was one of biggest contributors to the gain, adding
2.5 per cent to $18.
Company reporting season kicked off with GUD Holdings revealing its half-year bottom line net profit
had plunged 74 per cent to $4.8 million.
Even after accounting for one-off restructuring costs of $10.1 million in its Sunbeam and Dexion
businesses, the electrical appliance manufacturer's underlying profit was down 31.4 per cent.
However, GUD's stock added 0.4 per cent to $5.74.

But it was the big four banks that did the most heavy lifting. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
National Australia Bank (NAB) both rose 1 per cent to $76.10 and $33.99 respectively. Westpac
Banking Corp added 0.8 per cent to $31.79, and ANZ Banking Group gained 0.9 per cent to $31.15.

"Bank stocks won't do as well in 2014 as they have over the past three years but will still generate
decent returns," said T. Rowe Price's Australia head of equities Randal Jenneke, who holds the big
four bank stocks.

"Valuations are higher but profits are also stronger, " he added.

Mr Jenneke is most bullish on NAB and ANZ. "NAB is best placed to benefit from an expected
pick-up in demand for business credit this year and may get an opportunity to divest its United
Kingdom business, while ANZ has the fastest-growing domestic mortgages book and, with the right
focus, its Asian expansion strategy will provide more growth," Mr Jenneke said.
However, the biggest growth opportunities for the year ahead are likely to be found in mining stocks,
he said.Mining sector comes in last
But mining was the worst-performing sector on Tuesday, down 0.3 per cent, after commodity prices
weakened while the local dollar strengthened.

cent to $5.41 after the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, fell 2 per cent to $US124.80 a tonne.

Australia's most important export is down more than $US10 per tonne since the start of the year.
The country's biggest iron ore producer, Rio Tinto, dropped 1 per cent to $65.80. Junior iron ore
miner Atlas Iron was hard hit, shedding 4.8 per cent at 94¢. Resources giant BHP Billiton dipped
0.1 per cent to $37.95, ahead of expectations it will report increased coal and iron ore output in its
December quarter results on Wednesday.
"Investors are looking for continued growth in BHP's key coal and iron ore businesses as new mines
ramp up," UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock said.
"The copper division is expected to be fairly flat since the September quarter, while a 7 per cent to
8 per cent decline in petroleum production was flagged in detailed guidance provided in December."

Australia's biggest petroleum producer, Woodside Petroleum, fell 1.1 per cent to $38.37 despite Brent
crude oil edging up to $US106.50 a barrel.

West Australian miner Sandfire Resources dropped 3.3 per cent to $6.48 despite reporting
December-quarter copper production numbers that slightly overshot analyst expectations.
Resolute Mining, a WA-based gold prospector mining onshore and in Africa, rose 0.8 per cent to
60¢ after showing it increased total gold output while reducing production costs in the December
quarter.

"Resolute's production report was largely in line with expectations, however it is mildly concerning
that the balance sheet was a little weaker," Canaccord Genuity analyst Reg Spencer said.

"It will be a tougher year for Resolute due to the high capital expenditure associated with the Syama
expansion project, before production and cash flow improves in 2015."
Engineering firmTransfield Services was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 7.5 per
cent to 93.5¢.
