Demand

TD

The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to expand by a little
less than 2% in 2014, slightly slower than last month as supplies are affected by unplanned outages.
Nevertheless, new demand will continue to come from China, where imports have been rising quickly and
from smaller, but fast-growing, economies in South-east Asia and Latin America. There were 29 countries
that imported LNG in 2013, according to data from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas
Importers (GIIGNL), three more than a year earlier as new import terminals opened in Malaysia,
Singapore and Israel. The number of countries importing LNG will grow again in 2014-15 as new terminals
are added in eastern and central Europe. Import growth will accelerate to over 4% in 2015 as the first of
the mega export projects from Australia starts producing, while major consumers, such as Japan and
increasingly China, add new import capacity.

We are now presenting our historical and forecast data in line with figures from the GIIGNL. Import and
export capacity is generally presented in metric tonnes rather than cubic metres for general gas
consumption or production (1m tonnes of LNG is equivalent to 1.36bn cu metres of natural gas). New data
from the GIIGNL show that Asia remained the overwhelming market for LNG imports in 2013, taking over
75% of the global market. This was an increase from a 70.8% share in 2012 that came largely at the
expense of falling imports into Europe (14% of the market in 2013, compared with nearly 30% in 2010).
The bulk of the market remains on medium to long-term contracts, with spot purchases taking less than
30% of the total. As significant increases in export capacity come on line from 2014-20, we would expect
this share to rise as a more tradable and liquid market in LNG emerges.
Gas will still have a place in Japan's energy mix, despite nuclear restart

We expect Japan's LNG imports to stay fairly flat, but elevated compared with its historical level, in
2014-15. In 2013 the country imported a record 87.5m tonnes, according to customs data, and imports in
the first four months of 2014 were up by 1.3% year on year. Japan has relied heavily on both gas- and
coal-fired power since the country's nuclear capacity was shut down following the 2011 earthquake. The
government's new Basic Energy Plan includes a return of some nuclear power and will also make
substantial use of coal as a baseload fuel. The scale of the nuclear re-emergence is currently unclear, but
we expect that it will begin to cut into natural gas's, and consequently LNG's, market share, but not until
beyond our forecast period. In the medium term, however, Japan will still rely on natural-gas-fired power,
and the major downside risk is not related to the competition from nuclear, but the impact of the weak yen
driving up energy costs. Nevertheless, natural gas will play a long-term role in meeting Japan's energy
demands: major utilities announced plans at the end of March to add around 1,800 mw of new gas-fired
capacity in the 2020s.

Japan's utilities are among the most active LNG buyers in seeking ways to develop the market. Chubu
Electric Power, which consumed 14m tonnes of LNG in 2013 (around 16% of total Japanese imports)
signed a Memorandum of Understanding with GAIL, an Indian utility, to club together in securing LNG
cargos in an attempt to drive down prices. In addition, the Japan OTC Exchange is exploring plans to set
up derivatives trading in LNG that should allow end-users to hedge purchases at times of greater demand.

South Korea's policies and plans will support greater LNG imports

Page198of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.South Korea's LNG import growth will slow in 2014 owing to a high base effect from 2013, when the
country increased its reliance on the fuel after several nuclear facilities were shuttered because of faked
security certificates and maintenance. LNG shipments to the world's second-largest importer rose by
around 10% in 2013. Recent revised data for 2014 show that imports were up by 1.8% year on year in
January-April, and we have nudged down our import forecast slightly to 2.8%, from 3% previously.
KOGAS, the Korean utility that is the world's single-largest buyer of liquefied gas, is carrying out work on
two import terminals. The first, at Samecheok, will start operations in 2015 with import capacity of 8.4m
tonnes/year (t/y), and will support a faster level of import growth that year; the second facility, at Boryeong,
is scheduled to start importing in 2016 with capacity of 3m t/y. South Korea is encouraging greater use of
gas compared with coal, providing tax breaks at the retail and wholesale level for gas consumers. The
prospect of a gas pipeline linking South Korea and Russia could displace some of the country's reliance
on LNG imports, but we do not expect this to happen in the near term.
China's LNG demand could be boosted by cheaper gas
Consumption from China is on track to record another year of fast-paced growth. LNG imports were up by
over 22% year on year in January-April, despite enormous growth in the year-earlier period. We expect
China's import growth to expand by 16.8% on average in 2014-15 as new LNG import terminals are
added and the government makes a slow but strategic commitment to moving China's energy balance
away from coal and towards greater use of cleaner-burning natural gas. The government reforms
announced in November 2013 suggest that China is aiming to move to more market-based pricing for
fuels, which would enhance the appeal of LNG imports. China will also roll out higher wholesale and retail
gas prices in 2014-15, which will help importers to recoup losses on LNG. With pollution increasingly
moving up China's public agenda, we expect sustained increases in natural gas demand. In 2013 we
estimate that the country's shortfall between domestic production and consumption was around 60bn cu
metres. LNG is increasingly providing a larger share of this gap.
In May 2014, PetroChina, a state-owned energy company, signed a US$400bn, 30-year agreement with
Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled gas company, to supply China with 38bn cu metres/year of gas.
China will use the gas to meet fast-rising demand-the government expects China to consume around
400bn cu metres/year by 2020-but it will also put pressure on LNG exporters relying on selling into China.
The terms of the deal have not been officially disclosed but the cost of gas is estimated at US$350/1,000
cu metres (equivalent to far less than current spot prices for LNG). The cheaper pipeline-delivered gas will
allow Chinese importers to put downward pressure on LNG exporters to match the Russian gas price.

Higher gas prices could support greater LNG demand in India

Data from the GIIGNL show that India's LNG imports fell by nearly 2% in 2013 despite additional import
capacity being added. The relatively high cost of imported gas, compared with coal, at a time of weakness
in the rupee will have contributed to the weaker volumes last year. In 2014-15 imports of LNG are
tentatively forecast to expand by 2% on average. India's new government, led by the new prime minister,
Narendra Modi, may follow through with a plan to double gas prices in India to US$8.4/mBtu, helping to
narrow the gap between government set prices and imported LNG. Domestic prices are still likely to
undercut the cost of imported LNG, and until this mismatch is erased, Indian LNG imports will be relatively
muted.

New markets emerging in South-east Asia

South-east Asia is a small but growing LNG importing region. In 2013 both Malaysia and Singapore
started importing LNG and both have plans to expand import capacity. Meanwhile, Indonesia is converting
its Arun export terminal to an import facility and planning to add some floating storage and regasification
units (FSRU). Despite its high costs, LNG still remains an attractive fuel source for many energy-strapped
nations in Asia, particularly as existing power infrastructure is largely gas-fired.

New markets will not offset weak European import levels

In line with a third annual decline in underlying natural gas consumption, LNG imports into Europe's main
consumers fell again in 2013. Imports into the UK, which had been the third-largest buyer as recently as
2011, fell by over 30% in 2013 and have started 2014 on a strongly negative trend, as a mild winter has
dampened demand for gas. Likewise, Spain, France and Turkey-all considerable importers-also saw large
declines in LNG imports in 2013 as overall gas demand dropped in OECD Europe. In eastern Europe and
the Baltic, new import terminals will open in Poland and Lithuania and will start receiving cargoes in
earnest by 2015. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the escalating political tension between it and the EU
have raised concern about the region's heavy dependency on Russian gas. In early March Finland and
Estonia signed an agreement jointly to develop an LNG import facility. In the short term the simplest
course of action to decrease reliance on Russian gas would be to improve the EU's internal gas networks,

Page199of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.so that fuel landed in France or Spain is directed eastwards rather than to Latin American or Asian
markets.

Import demand is accelerating in Latin America

Mexico was one of the fastest-growing import markets for LNG in 2013, with imports rising by over 60%.
Argentina and Brazil also saw rapid growth in imports, and further gains in Brazil are likely as the country
seeks to ensure adequate power supply during this summer's football World Cup tournament. Import
capacity expansions are also under way in Chile, which will add to regional imports at the margins.

Supply

Global LNG exports will expand by less than 2% in 2014, slower than we forecast last month, as
unplanned outages at the Angola facility will cut into available supplies. New liquefaction facilities in
Australia and Papua New Guinea will begin operation in 2014, helping to add new exports to the market,
and we expect further growth of around 4.2% in 2015 as more capacity enters the market. Over 11m
tonnes of entirely new liquefaction capacity is on track to be completed by the end of 2014, and the full
start-up of replacement trains in Algeria will bring the total additional capacity closer to 20m tonnes. In
2015 an even greater volume of new capacity is due to come on line, including the first LNG export
terminal in the US and the Gorgon megaproject in Australia. LNG projects are routinely subject to delays
caused by cost overruns or construction timelines. In addition, many of the firms behind proposed export
terminals in the US, Canada and Australia may lack the capital, financial robustness and technical
capabilities to bring their projects on line. Nevertheless, from 2015-19 we expect a significant expansion of
the global LNG industry, even if only a small share of the proposed projects comes to fruition.

Qatar's output to be flat in 2014-15

Qatar's LNG exports rose by over 2% in 2013, with over 70% of exports directed toward Asian markets. At
present Qatar has no plans to add additional LNG capacity, and we forecast relatively stable production in
2014-15, with the only variation being the result of maintenance. Although the country has secured
long-term supply contracts with many Asian consumers, it is facing pressure to cut prices as the advent of
cheaper US LNG exports comes closer to fruition.

Malaysia raises production via floating LNG and expansion at existing site
Malaysia exported 25m tonnes of LNG in 2013, 5% higher than 2012. Petronas, the state-run oil and gas
company, is carrying out expansion work at Malaysia's existing LNG export facility at Bintulu, adding a
ninth train that it expects to start operating by late 2015 or into 2016. Petronas is also undertaking work on
developing two floating LNG facilities (FLNG). The Petronas FLNG vessel is due to start operations in
2015 with capacity of 1.2m t/y; its hull was launched in April 2014 and the vessel is on track to be
completed by the end of the year. The Rotan FLNG-which will have slightly larger capacity-is scheduled to
begin producing LNG by 2018. Malaysia's share of the global LNG market will start to fall from 2015 when
greater Australian production enters the market and as more natural gas is consumed locally. Petronas
opened Malaysia's first LNG import terminal in 2013 and several more are due to be commissioned
between 2015 and 2017. Part of the fuel for these facilities is likely to be produced locally.

Page200of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.US government revises LNG approval process

In May the US government revised its approval process for LNG export facilities under consideration.
Companies will now need to receive environmental approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) first, before the Department of Energy (DoE) authorises exports to countries with
whom the US does not have a free-trade agreement. FERC approval is a more onerous and lengthy
process, and the government's objective may be to identify only projects that have the substantial
commercial backing of either buyers or companies with LNG experience. Over 280m tonnes of export
capacity has been proposed to the DoE, and there was never any likelihood that the full amount would
enter the market. So far only one project is under construction: Sabine Pass in Louisiana. Additional
facilities received interim environmental approval from the FERC in May; Dominion Resource's Cove Point
facility in Maryland and the Downeast LNG plant in Maine. However, these facilities will still need to
receive full FERC approval before they begin construction. At present, we do not expect exports of LNG
from the US to make a significant impact on global markets until 2016 at the earliest, with a greater effect
towards the end of the decade.

New gas production will be needed for Algeria to expand LNG exports

Algeria is set to open the 4.8m-t/y Arzew LNG train in mid-2014, following on from the 4.5m-t/y train at
Skikda, which replaced an earlier, damaged facility. We expect gas exports to rise by an average of 2.8%
in 2014-15, helping to reverse several years of falling output. Similarly to other early movers in the LNG
industry, rapidly growing domestic gas demand is putting pressure on the availability of supply for exports,
suggesting that Algeria will struggle to raise output significantly in the forecast period.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, political and economic disruptions have affected the supply of LNG from
Egypt. Since the overthrow of the Mubarak govern-ment in 2011, Egypt's LNG output has dropped off
markedly and we now expect almost no contribution to global markets from Egypt in 2014-15. In Yemen,
exports rose strongly in 2013, but maintenance on one of the country's two trains in June will mean lower
output in 2014, before a recovery in 2015. Over the long term there is potential for additional LNG exports
from the eastern Mediterranean, with Israel exploring the option of LNG to be fed by offshore gasfields and
an export terminal under discussion for Cyprus.

Angola LNG has been shut down until at least 2015
Angola LNG, the only major new export facility to come on line in 2013, has suspended operations until at
least 2015 as a result of technical issues at the facility. The plant is targeting output of 5.2m t/y and sells
directly into the spot market. Angola has also apparently leased out its entire tanker fleet, which should
help to ease prices in 2014. As a result of the outage, we have cut our Angola export forecast to flat in
2014, with a recovery expected in 2015.

New projects are unlikely in Nigeria

Supplies of LNG from Nigeria continue to be affected by a difficult operating environment. Output fell
sharply in 2013, by nearly 16%, and we expect only a minimal recovery in 2014-15. Persistent security
concerns and availability of gas have hampered plans to expand Nigeria's LNG potential, and the
economic rationale for new projects has dissipated as the US no longer needs LNG imports in the near to
medium term.

Elsewhere in Africa, attention is focusing on the potential for East Africa to emerge as a new LNG
exporting region. Both Mozambique and Tanzania have discovered large commercial reserves of gas. Eni
(Italy) and Anadarko (US) have entered into an agreement to develop a four-train, 20m-t/y facility in
Mozambique, which the government expects to be operational by 2018. However, substantial investment
in infrastructure will be required to bring the project on line and we do not expect it before the end of the
decade. East African gas also faces a risk from impending US exports, where significant energy
infrastructure is already in place.
Australian projects will lead to significant reshaping of global industry

There are currently 61.9m tonnes of new LNG export capacity under construction in Australia. This would
represent more than one-quarter of total global supply in 2013, and if all was completed on schedule by
the end of 2017 would make Australia the leading producer of LNG, ahead of Qatar. The first of the new
large Australian LNG projects, the 8.5m-t/y Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) facility, is on course to start
production in the fourth quarter of 2014. QCLNG is the world's first coal-seam gas LNG project and its
off-take is geared mainly towards Asian (China, Japan and Singapore) buyers. Plans to expand the
project have now been put on hold in consideration of the massive capital expenditure required for LNG
projects. After QCLNG, the next mega-project due to come on line is the 15.6m-t/y Gorgon facility,
operated by Chevron. The giant plant has reportedly secured sales-and-purchase agreements, mainly

Page201of298©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.with Asian utilities. Expansion of the project seems unlikely, given the already huge sums that the
companies backing the project have had to invest.

There are several additional projects under consideration in Australia that could bring total capacity to
nearly 100m t/y, well above Qatar's already huge production. However, substantial cost overruns and
competition from the development of export facilities in the US have led some firms to reconsider projects
that have longer timeframes. LNG Limited planned to start producing 3.8m t/y by 2017 from its
Fisherman's Landing project, but has now reported that it is struggling to secure adequate gas supplies.
Meanwhile, the Browse project (Woodside, Shell BHP Billiton and smaller Japanese partners) is now
being reconsidered for conversion to an FLNG vessel.

PNGLNG will start production ahead of schedule

The 6.9m-t/y Papua New Guinea LNG (PNGLNG) has shipped its first LNG to Japan, ahead of schedule.
Buyers for PNGLNG's gas include Tepco and Osaka Gas in Japan, as well as Chinese and Taiwan
utilities. Elsewhere in PNG, the government has endorsed the sale of a majority stake in InterOil's
licences covering the Elk and Antelope natural gasfields to Total. InterOil has plans to develop an 11m-t/y
LNG facility in PNG's Gulf province, although the deal has yet to be signed, given a disagreement over the
value of Total's stake. The timeline for the project will fall well outside our forecast period, as the appraisal
of the Elk and Antelope fields, which would feed the facility, is set to be completed only by 2015.
Nevertheless, the deal suggests that new developments in PNG will help to compensate for falling exports
from other Pacific basin producers.

Indonesia's LNG exports to fall sharply as local gas production dwindles

Indonesia currently has three operating LNG export terminals, in Arun in Aceh, Bontang in East
Kalimantan and Tangguh in Papua. Exports have been declining in recent years as domestic consumption
of gas increases and production disruptions have cut supply. New production capabilities are under
construction, with the 2m-t/y Donggi-Senoro project set to start operations in 2015. Meanwhile, a final
investment decision is expected for an additional train at the Tangguh site that would bring total capacity
there to 11.4m t/y by 2019. At the same time, some of Indonesia's existing capacity, 2.5m t/y at Arun, is
due to be decommissioned in 2014-15 and the facility will start to serve as an LNG import terminal. In
February SKKMigas, the upstream energy regulator, announced that the Tangguh plant would be shut in
July-August for planned maintenance. At around the same time SKKMigas awarded a consortium of
international firms contracts to develop the Jangrik gasfields, which are set to add LNG export capacity
from 2017.

Russia is keen to emerge as a major new LNG exporter

Russia is seeking to increase its share of the global LNG market with plans for further export facilities.
Until now Gazprom (50.1% government-controlled) had a monopoly over natural gas exports and shipped
LNG from its 10m-t/y Sakhalin plan on the Pacific coast, operated in partnership with Shell (and where a
preliminary agreement for a new train has been signed by the project partners). However, a law
liberalising LNG exports from 2014 was passed in 2013. Rosneft, a majority state-owned oil producer,
signed a huge, US$270bn energy supply deal with China, which includes providing up to 3m t/y of LNG. It
has also signed LNG supply contracts with Vitol, an oil trader, and Japanese energy firms, to be supplied
from a facility in eastern Russia from 2019. It now looks likely that the Russian LNG industry will be
characterised by competition between Rosneft and Gazprom both for resources and buyers, with the
sector remaining highly subject to government policy decisions. The most immediate transformation in
Russia's LNG capacity will come from the Yamal LNG project, which is under development by Novatek, a
Russian oil major. Yamal LNG will begin production in 2016 and will have capacity of 16.5m t/y. Novatek
has arranged preliminary financing from several Chinese banks for its project. Gazprom's Vladivostok
LNG, with expected capacity of up to 10m t/y, is expected to become operational in 2018. We expect
overall Russian LNG production to continue to tick upwards in 2014, ahead of sizeable increases
thereafter.

Prices

LNG spot prices for delivery into North Asia have eased back sharply from the high levels in the first two
months of 2014, when prices hit a record of over US$20/mBtu. In early June spot prices were being
reported at below US$13/mBtu. We expect prices for imported LNG into Japan (an average of long-term
and spot prices) to move downwards this year. Prices will continue to slide in 2015-16 as new supplies
come into the market from Australia and PNG, and Angola resumes exports. The introduction of LNG
exports from the US will add further downward momentum to markets. As the LNG market becomes
increasingly more globalised through the introduction of US, East African and Canadian exports in the
latter parts of the decade, we expect to see the development of more futures and exchange-based trading,
allowing consumers and producers to take advantage of regional changes in natural gas demand.
