MILWAUKEE, WI -- (Marketwired) -- 05/15/14 -- ZBB Energy Corporation (NYSE MKT: ZBB), a leading
developer of intelligent, renewable energy power platforms and hybrid vehicle control systems, today
announced its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014. Third Quarter Highlights
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Company's major accomplishments included: Completed
a secondary offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at $2.25 per share for net cash proceeds of
$13.1 million. Achieved the initial milestone of the joint development agreement with Lotte Chemical, and
received $3 million in one-time upfront license fees for the quarter. Tested and shipped equipment to
Ergon Energy in Australia.

Ergon has successfully completed their lab testing and will place the equipment in the field over the
coming weeks as part of their field trial to determine suitability. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter
of fiscal year 2014, the Company: Hired a sales manager for the state of Hawaii. Advanced to the RFQ
stage for the Imperial Irrigation District's 40-megawatt energy storage project. "The completion of our
secondary offering and the initiation of the Lotte Chemical project strengthened our balance sheet this
quarter and enhanced our financial capacity to more aggressively pursue the multiple sales opportunities
in our markets," said Eric C. Apfelbach, President and Chief Executive Officer. "To prepare for these
opportunities, we are actively working to add staff in our sales and technical areas, including our recent
hire of a sales manager for Hawaii." "Additionally, ZBB and Lotte are working towards an agreement that
would enable Lotte to purchase from ZBB the "chassis" frame, internal componentry and power
electronics for ZBB EnerStore? flow batteries, whereby Lotte will source the electrolyte and manufacture
the stacks to be placed in the chassis frame provided by ZBB. This combined global manufacturing
strategy will give us the lowest possible costs and enable us to ramp quickly to meet the large demand
that is being indicated by the RFQ activity." "We believe our products are the right fit for the multi-billion
dollar energy storage proposals in California, New York, Province of Ontario and South Korea." continued
Mr. Apfelbach. "We expect additional energy storage proposals going forward, including in China, which
we believe over time has the potential to be a $40 billion market opportunity." Financial results for the
three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013 included:
Product sales decreased 59% to $822,318 from $2,019,191. Engineering and development revenues
increased 650% to $750,000 from $100,000. License revenues were $3,000,000. Product gross margin

fiscal 2014 with total assets of $23.5 million, including $13.4 million in cash and $583,000 in accounts

partners, including Lotte Chemical and Cummins Crosspoint, to extend our relationships and secure
additional business. In addition, the recently announced plan by the U.S. Department of Energy to offer up
to $4 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy projects could rejuvenate interest and orders in the
