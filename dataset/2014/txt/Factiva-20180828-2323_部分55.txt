REVELATIONS that Chinese company Everich International plans to build a five-star hotel in
Tamworth has sent local property tycoons into a frenzy.
A Queensland-based real estate agent with close ties to the company said landholders had
contacted him spruiking their properties as a suitable site.

The Leader yesterday broke the news that Everich International has proposed building a
multimillion-dollar luxury hotel in Tamworth's CBD.
The company, which purchased the Woolworths supermarket development for $30 million earlier in
the year, intends to invest heavily in Tamworth.

Ray White Project Marketing selling principal Andrew Schmidt said he had been contacted by "a
number" of property owners within hours of the story breaking.

"We've received some interest as a result of the (story) from people who believe they have a
potentially suitable location," he said.

Mr Schmidt said he believed Tamworth was a thriving regional city that could easily accommodate a
five-star hotel.
