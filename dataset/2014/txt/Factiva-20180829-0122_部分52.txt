*Japan's GDP rose 0.7% in the 4th quarter from the September quarter vs the preliminary estimate of 1%
and the 0.9% median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

Our market gave back all but 6.7 points of last week's 57.5 point gain as miners plunged on weaker than
expected China trade and inflation data - and with Japan's GDP also weaker than expectations,
Australia's two major trading partners. The heavy volume for a Monday, and with Melbourne and Adelaide
closed on holiday, was not a good look. There was some good buying in safe sector stocks, including
biotechs and hi techs - but not Telstra, which also gave back a few.

"Probably going to give back about 25 on the day"

"Maree" said, "We are probably going to give back about 25 on the day, with volumes thinned by Labor
Day holidays in Victoria and South Australia. The RBA Governor has said rates will probably be stable for
awhile. The numbers we received last week were better than expected, showing that the low interest rates
are filtering through into the economy". Maree added, "If the $A drops, our inflation rate is likely to rise
above 2% because of the amount of goods we import".
Meanwhile, she said, "We are very dependent on our trading partners, China and Japan. Japan is still in
diabolic trouble. The Chinese export numbers were lower than expected - the slow down there may be
bigger than even the Chinese government expects.

"In the US, although the employment number was higher, the economy is not picking up as rapidly as
expected and interest rates are likely to remain low for a considerable length of time".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 16.4 points to 5462.3 on Friday.

NEWS OF THE DAY
Hong Kong version of LME to be launched in 2014 - South China Morning Post
The South China Morning Post announced the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's plan to introduce
the Hong Kong version of the London Metal Exchange platform this year is a baby step to kick off the
local commodities market, but brokers and observers warned there will be challenges in developing the
new market.

"HKEx spent a lot of money buying the LME in 2012 but we have yet to see how the deal will help
promote the local commodities market. It is good to see HKEx is finally doing something to promote
commodities trading in Hong Kong," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a legislator for the financial
services sector.

"HKEx is expected to face a lot of challenges in promoting this new market as
The exchange's chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week that it would introduce a Hong Kong
platform for the LME, the world's biggest physical metals exchange and the global benchmark for setting
prices of industrial metals such as copper and aluminium.

The bourse has not yet announced what products will be traded on the platform, but Li said they would be
settled by cash and all local futures brokers could trade on it with no need to apply for membership of the
LME. It will also negotiate with exchanges on the mainland for possible cross-selling of each other's
products.

HKEx is struggling to show its shareholders that the LME deal is value for money after reporting a
disappointing 11 per cent profit rise last year, lower than the market estimate of 16 per cent growth, partly
as a result of the costs related to the LME acquisition.

As reported by OzEquities on Saturday, the Financial Times in London reports that on Friday South Africa
approved amendments to its Mineral Development Act which gives far reaching implications to petroleum
and coal miners in South Africa (more below in Other News), confirmed by us in a search of South
Africa's government website.
*The Financial Times commented, "Anglo American currently sells thermal coal for just $17 a tonne in
South Africa against $74 to export markets and iron ore for $62 a tonne against $115 internationally".

"Mineweb" in Johannesburg last Friday carried the following report,

Author: Ayanda Mdluli

Posted: Friday , 07 Mar 2014
" According to Lizel Oberholzer, director and head of oil and gas at pan-African corporate law firm
Bowman Gilfillan, “Some of the most significant changes to the Bill were rushed through this week,
including provisions for state participation in petroleum licences,” she said in a statement.

Oberholzer noted that earlier versions of the Bill entitled the State to a free carried interest of 20% and a
further participation interest of 30% with the total state interest capped at 50%.

“The version that was approved yesterday removed the reference to a 30% participation interest as well
as the limit of 50%, effectively giving the State the right to take over an existing petroleum operation,” she
explained.

While previously the State was obligated to pay “a fair market value” for any participation interest that it
acquired, it now only needs to pay “an agreed price” which would present major problems in the future as
the Bill does not make any provision for a situation where price cannot be agreed upon”.

The Bill also introduces the notion of ‘production sharing agreements’, a system employed in other
countries with mature upstream industries. However, South Africa currently implements a tax royalty
system in the minerals and petroleum sector and it is unclear how this system will be combined with a
production sharing regime,” she said.

James Lorimer, shadow minister for mineral resources at the Democratic Alliance (The country's official
opposition in government) referred to the bill as a 'crony enrichment bill', because of the power to
designate mining licence beneficiaries it will provide the Minister.
Also, the state will be entitled to take over 100% of oil and gas companies, 20% for free and the other
80% at a forced, 'fire sale' price; which will allow the Minister to rule the sector by making regulations
which can easily be changed at short notice, he said (our italics)

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has used its majority muscle to override any opposition to
amendments of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, effectively opening the door for
the nationalisation of the oil and gas sector.
The act will effectively govern South Africa’s entire mineral resources sector, including the nascent oil and
gas sector that aims to explore for and extract shale gas in the Karoo.

On Thursday, Parliament’s mineral resources committee finalised its clause-by-clause deliberations on the
bill in a meeting characterised by sniping between ANC and Democratic Alliance MPs.

The votes on contested clauses were always eight to two in the ANC’s favour.

The most contentious of the clauses was introduced by the ANC on Wednesday evening and concerned
the state’s participation in oil and gas production.

While the DA bitterly opposed the changes, saying they would smother investment in the sector, the ANC
overrode its concerns by claiming that the changes were based on the ideology of those who voted for
them.

The two clauses fall under section 86 of the draft law.

The first clause gives the state, through a designated organ of state, the right to a 20% free carried
interest on all new exploration and production rights of oil and gas.

Page122of270©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The second clause now says that in addition to the free carry interest, the state is "entitled" to a further
participation of up to 80%.
Currently the clause imposes a ceiling on the state for an additional acquisition of 30% of the venture.
The oil and gas sector has opposed strongly the proposed free carry interest and the 30% ceiling. A
number of oil and gas sector company representatives left Thursday’s meeting in a sullen mood and
refused to comment, only indicating they would prepare a statement on the matter.
Webber Wentzel law firm partner Peter Leon said that while the bill had been improved considerably,
especially in terms of the beneficiation issue, he found the oil and gas provisions troubling.

"Those provisions are clearly undesirable and will have a negative effect on the sector," he said.

On Friday, the committee will finalise its report on the bill for the National Assembly and it may be debated
next week, which will be the last parliamentary session ahead of the May 7 national and provincial
elections.
Mining laws:

On February 21, publication "African Law and Business' had said "the proposed changes include
reserving 20% of all new energy ventures for state ownership, free of charge and forcing mining
companies to sell a certain percentage of minerals and precious metals to local businesses.

(The publication had not expected the decision to be made until after the May election, and expected it
would come into force next year).

More than 150 weather reports broken in the 2013/14 summer - Climate Council

ABC News reports the Climate Council in its "Angry Summer" report says more than 150 weather records
were broken this summer.

Adelaide experienced 13 days over 40 degrees Celsius, including five days in a row over 42C.

The South Australian capital also had its hottest ever February day of 44.7C.

While South Australia was described as the summer's "ground zero", it was also the driest summer on
record for 38 spots in New South Wales and 45 in Queensland, while Sydney had its driest summer in 27
years.

Melbourne had its hottest 24-hour period, with an average temperature of 35.5C, and Perth had its
hottest-ever night and its second-hottest summer on record.

The council's Lesley Hughes says the hotter, drier weather conditions are heightening the risks of
bushfires.

Victoria's February fires burnt 280,000 hectares of land.

Ms Hughes, a Macquarie University professor, says the weather patterns are clearly due to climate
change and governments need to address it as an issue.

"We're having difficulty dealing with it now; our children and grandchildren will be having a great deal more
difficulty dealing with it in decades to come," she said.

"It's consistent with the predictions of what happens as the globe warms up.

"Climate change is making the whole weather system different to what it used to be and along with that is
an increase in extreme events."

The council says the nature of heatwaves is changing, and they are now tending to start earlier, last
longer and occur more frequently.

Some of the records were for above-average rain which fell over parts of Cape York Peninsula, the
Northern Territory, Western Australia and along South Australia's coast.

The report called for "urgent and deep reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases' to stabilise the
climate.
