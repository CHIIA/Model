0106 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong equities are seen falling in early trading as investors cool off after
the Hang Seng Index set fresh highs for the year on Monday. The benchmark gained 0.2% to 25,166.91,
and index futures are down 0.7% ahead of the market open. Emerging market equities "are likely to
consolidate with an upward bias as mood in global markets is positive after S&P 500 closed at a record
overnight," says Credit Agricole. Chinese corporate earnings season continues, with companies
including Agricultural Bank of China (1288.HK), COSCO Pacific (1199.HK) and Henderson Land
Development Company (0012.HK) among the companies scheduled to report earnings today.

0103 GMT [Dow Jones] The New Zealand dollar slipped to a four-day low of 86.46 against the yen
Tuesday after Statistics New Zealand said the country recorded a NZ$692 million trade deficit for July,
wider than the consensus forecast of a NZ$500 million deficit. Diminished investor risk appetite as
Tokyo stocks post modest losses (Japan's Nikkei Stock Average is down 0.09% at 15,599.79) is also
weighing on the risk-sensitive Kiwi. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the NZD/JPY spot rate falling
below the base of a bearish flag pattern. The cross could slip further in the near term to 86.30
(Wednesday's reaction low), and then to 85.96 (Aug. 12 minor pivot low). Resistance is expected at
86.85 (middle 20-day Bollinger Band), then at 87.22 (upper 20-day one-standard deviation Bollinger
Band). Spot NZD/JPY is at 86.62 versus 86.76 late Monday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0059 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's central bank looks to be too pessimistic on the outlook for investment,
says Diana Mousina, economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Leading indicators of
non-mining business investment continue to point to a sustained pick up in growth, she says. Mousina
notes that a significant lift in commercial finance commitments over the past six months suggests we
should see non-mining investment lift toward the end of the year. She also says that business surveys
have shown a marked improvement for confidence and trading conditions but also in expected
investment plans. Official government data excludes investment in sectors like health and education
where investment is growing strongly. 2Q business investment data is due out on
Thursday.(james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0024 GMT [Dow Jones] The Aussie/Kiwi cross reached 1.1169 Tuesday--its highest mark since Dec. 2,
2013--after Statistics New Zealand said the country recorded a NZ$692 million trade deficit for July,
wider than the consensus forecast of a NZ$500 million deficit. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the
AUD/NZD daily price chart is positive-biased as the five- and 15-day moving averages are advancing.
The cross is poised to advance further in the near term to 1.1223--the Nov. 29, 2013 reaction high.
Support is expected at 1.1065--base of "buy zone" of the 20-day Bollinger Band (an area between the
one- and two-standard deviation upper Bollinger bands); and then at 1.1002 (middle 20-day Bollinger
Band). Spot AUD/NZD is at 1.1148 versus 1.1132 late Monday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

0022 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar has continued in a narrow range overnight, despite another
leg down in the spot iron ore price, says David de Garis, senior economist at NAB. Iron ore fell another
1.0% to US$89.2/ton, putting "within a whisker" of its post global financial crisis lows of US$86.70/ton

Australia on the continuing divergence between the Australian dollar and Australia's terms of trade," Mr.
de Garis said. The Australian dollar was trading in early Asia at US$0.9275. (james.glynn@wsj.com;

0011 GMT [Dow Jones] The strong NZD and falling commodity prices are starting to affect New
Zealand's trade position "which contributed to a larger-than-expected July trade deficit," ANZ says. And
while "the annual trade surplus widened" this looks to be on borrowed time, it says. The NZD/USD is now
close to 0.0500 below last month's peak and the adjustment of the NZD to lower commodity prices
appears to be happening. "However, the NZD remains a roadblock to export-sector earnings and wider
economic activity--underscoring the need to lift productivity to remain viable."

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZ July merchandise trade deficit was larger than Westpac or the market
expected, "due to a larger than expected drop in export receipts," Westpac senior economist Michael
Gordon in a note. "We suspect that the surprise is largely due to normal monthly volatility in export
volumes, given that the fall in world prices for dairy and logs was already known." He adds that Westpac
had expected the import bill to include the first of Air New Zealand's new Boeing 787
Dreamliners--probably worth around NZ$200m; "However, Statistics NZ excluded this item from the trade
figures in order to keep the purchase price confidential."(lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter:

2329 GMT [Dow Jones] While Australia's labor market has deteriorated over recent years, Barclays,
Australia chief economist Kieran Davies said he thinks the recent rise in unemployment it 12-year highs
is overstated. The jump in unemployment in July to 6.4% from 6.0% is typically seen in a deep recession,
he said. Davies adds the backdrop for the labor market has actually improved this year. Companies are
hiring again, job ads are up and surveyed business conditions have improved. Importantly, capacity
utilization has trended higher, which normally foreshadows falling unemployment, he said. This suggests
that unemployment could peak this year, far sooner than the Reserve Bank's bleak forecast that
unemployment will stay high until 2016. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

2315 GMT [Dow Jones] The decline in AUD may accelerate this week according to BNP Paribas. It notes
the 2Q private sector capex will be released Thursday and "there is a risk of a third straight negative
print, which would weigh on the AUD given that FX markets remain long according to BNP Paribas
Positioning Analysis." It is currently short AUD/CAD and "we see the AUD as vulnerable this week."
AUD/CAD is at 1.0206 while AUD/USD is at 0.9285. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter:

2311 GMT [Dow Jones] Europe's problems remain the major focus for markets as German confidence
continues to decline and French politics remains turbulent, says ANZ Bank - noting Hollande has been
forced into his third major ministerial reshuffle in two years. The result was new record lows in Bund
yields and Belgium two year yields dropping into negative territory for the first time. However "European
equities are following the U.S. model and rallying on speculation that the ECB may be closer to acting," it
says. Draghi's emphasis on fiscal policy at Jackson Hole - in suggesting that national structural policies
need to step up to the plate - mean European politics remain key in analysing the direction for EUR, says
ANZ. "Current sentiment is swayed towards anti-austerity, with associated political tensions as austerity
is perceived to be a German imposed policy in Europe," it says. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter:

2246 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Beach Energy's (BPT.AU) FY2015 oil, gas output guidance is softer than
RBC Capital Markets expected, but the broker believes it to be a very conservative outlook. On Monday,
Beach forecast output of between 8.6 million and 9.4 million barrels of oil equivalent in FY15, down
from 9.6 million BOE in the previous year. RBC notes Beach expects to spend up to 500 million
Australian dollars ($464.5 million) on its existing projects in FY15. "Approximately 40% of this capex will
be spent in the South Australia Cooper Basin JV as relatively low-risk development expenditure, we
think," RBC analyst Andrew Williams says. There also is potential for Beach to produce more from the
Cooper Basin, in particular, and its Egyptian assets. RBC rates Beach at outperform, with a A$2.00 price
target. BPT last traded at A$1.685. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

18:27 EDT -- Argentina's central bank raises interest rates on 98-days notes by one percentage point to
26.86%, just two weeks after it lowered rates by the same amount. Local media have widely reported that
the central bank's view on monetary policy differs somewhat from that of the economy ministry, but the
decision to raise rates reflects a government-wide recognition that cutting rates was unwise, says a
person familiar with the matter. Lower rates led more Argentines to buy US dollars in the black market,
pushing the underground exchange rate to a record low of around 14 pesos to the dollar. Government
officials all the way up to President Cristina Kirchner are said to be aware of how the rate cut caused

comment on policy matters. (taos.turner@wsj.com; @taos)
