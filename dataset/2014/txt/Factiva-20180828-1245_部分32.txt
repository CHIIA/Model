Aurizon chief executive Lance Hockridge has confirmed the rail group will consider selling a stake in
its Queensland tracks as it reported a 43 per cent fall in annual net profit to $253 million.

Aurizon is considering building new rail networks in Western Australia's Pilbara region as well as
Queensland's Galilee Basin to haul iron and coal for miners, and was evaluating "a range of options"
to pay for the projects, Mr Hockridge said.

"One of those options would be the potential to sell down an interest in the central Queensland coal
network."
Investment bank UBS has estimated that Aurizon could generate up to $2 billion by selling 49 per
cent of its Queensland track business .

Aurizon has not started talks with potential investors in the rail network because it had not made final
investment decisions on either project, Mr Hockridge said. The CEO indicated the Pilbara project
could proceed faster than the Galilee project because its Chinese partner, Baosteel, wants to start
exporting iron ore as soon as possible to supply a new steelworks plant in China.

Aurizon has delayed signing a final agreement with its Galilee partner, miner GVK Hancock, until early
next year. Mr Hockridge cautioned it would take about 12 months for the company to secure haulage
contracts before it could start building a new rail line and a new terminal at the port of Abbot Point.

"Whether it's a three-year horizon or a slightly longer horizon that ultimately the fundamental
economics will underpin both the development of T3 [terminal at Abbot Point] and of the opening up of
the Galilee," Mr Hockridge said.
The Galilee delay comes as Indian coal producer Adani pushes ahead with its own rail and port
project after striking a deal with Korean construction group POSCO to build a rail line to
Abbot Point.Shares fall

Aurizon's shares fell 3 per cent on Monday as investors were disappointed by weaker than expected
profits. Although underlying earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) rose 13 per cent on a year
earlier to $851 million due to stronger coal and iron ore haulage volumes, Aurizon did not take as
much cost out of its business in the second half as predicted.
Statutory net profits were hurt by previously announced asset impairments of $317 million and
voluntary redundancy costs of $69 million as Aurizon slashed jobs and scaled back its train fleet .
Analysts were concerned to see the company flag increased capital spending on IT, track
maintenance and fleet upgrades. It plans to lift spending to about $600 million annually between
fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2017 from $350 million annually.

Lynch, adding Aurizon had not provided much "hard detail" on how the additional spending would
improve revenues.
Mike Franczak, Aurizon's head of operations, argued higher capital spending was necessary for the
company to become a world-class operator.
Aurizon will accelerate group cost cuts to as much as $300 million over two years to fiscal 2015 from
an original target of $230 million.

Aurizon has been trying to negotiate a new enterprise agreement with workers in Queensland over the
past 18 months but is at "a hands in the air stage of frustration" over how to get a sensible outcome,
Mr Hockridge said.

Unions want a 4.5 per cent annual salary increase and no change to employment conditions.
Mr Hockridge's total pay package dropped to $5.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $6.1 million in fiscal
2013 due to a lower short term cash bonus and a flat fixed salary. Aurizon is changing the way it
measures executive performance to counter criticism from shareholders after 28 per cent of votes
were cast against its 2013 remuneration report. Aurizon's shares have risen 7.7 per cent in the past
12 months compared with a 9 per cent rise in the S&P/ASX 200.
