CHINESE steelmaker Baosteel and Australian rail operator Aurizon have moved a step closer to
sealing their $1.42 billion takeover of Aquila Resources.

The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approved the deal yesterday. The offer still needs
approval from Aquila’s shareholders before it can go ahead.

Aurizon boss Lance Hockridge and Baosteel’s chairman Zhihao Dai welcomed the FIRB’s decision.
Aquila said shareholders should take no action until the company’s independent board
sub-committee comes up with a formal recommendation on the offer.
The Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and Aurizon plan to kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara
Iron Ore Project if they succeed in their joint takeover bid.
Aquila Resources holds a 50 per cent stake in the project.

Analysts have said the deal was attractive for Aquila shareholders, but major hurdles remain for the
completion of such a large-scale mine, rail and port project. Aquila shares closed one cent higher at
$3.52 while Aurizon was flat at $4.94.
