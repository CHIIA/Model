Australian alumina prices climbed $2/mt after recent low prices, a fall in freight rates and higher
domestic alumina offers enticed some bargain hunters in China back to the Australian market, which
took the Platts daily Australian assessment to $309/mt FOB on June 25, up from $307.
Spot negotiations appeared to be CIF China-driven, rather than FOB Australia basis, possibly because
freight rates have fallen to a new low for the year to date. In addition, CIF buying rates appeared to be
more competitive than FOB Australian buying rates, in freight parity terms.

Platts assessed the Handysize freight market for alumina from Western Australia to Lianyungang in
northeast China unchanged at $20/mt on June 25, for 30,000 mt cargoes for late July/August loadings.
The assessment is down $2.50/mt from a week ago and $4 from a month ago, dragged down by a large
number of underutilized ships.
CIF China spot discussions centered around $330/mt, with buyers testing a few dollars below and
sellers a few above. Trader and consumer sources also said that the lower freight rates could lend
some support to the FOB Australia price.
A Chinese consumer said he would be keen to pick up an August shipment from Australia when his
company's credit line is restored. The buyer has been in talks with his lender for weeks about his credit
limit, and said he was expecting to be able to enter the market soon.
Another Chinese consumer/reseller was on the lookout for Australian material for shipment in
September and October. He cited buying interest at $306/mt, FOB Australia, and $326-327/mt CIF
China. "July is too prompt, and I'm done for August," he said.
A third Chinese consumer/reseller indicated buying rates at $326-327/mt CIF, while a fourth Chinese
consumer/reseller said she would not go over $300/mt, FOB Australia, but it was clearly very much
below-market.
A trader said he was in talks for a prompt sale at above $310/mt, FOB Australia, while another put
selling interest at $310-313/mt. However consumer/resellers were generally a couple of dollars below
$310/mt. Consumer and trade sources added that the rising offers for domestic alumina across China
may lend some support to Australian prices, in import parity terms. The domestic alumina price sets the
price floor for Australian material, sources said.
In addition, port stock alumina prices appeared to be relatively affordable compared with domestic
tonnage. Port stock prices were pegged at Yuan 2,480-2,490/mt ($403-405/mt) ex-Lianyungang on
June 24, down from Yuan 2,490-2,500/mt in early June and also down from Yuan 2,510-2,550/mt at the
start of May.
The Platts China daily alumina assessment for Henan province was stable at Yuan 2,440/mt ex-works
for 70:30 cash and credit payment terms on June 25, ahead of negotiations for July spot talks slated to
conclude next week. The assessment was up Yuan 10/mt on the week.

credit terms, but were up from Yuan 2,380-2,400/mt in early June. Down south, Guangxi prices were
rangebound at Yuan 2,250-2,280/mt cash to partial credit terms, but up from Yuan 2,230-2,260/mt at
the beginning of the month.
Buying and selling sources said any upswing in alumina prices would be capped by low aluminum
prices and possible smelter curtailments.

On June 25, the front-month July aluminum contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed at Yuan
13,440/mt, up from Yuan 13,325/mt a week earlier and but down from Yuan 13,565/mt on June 11.
