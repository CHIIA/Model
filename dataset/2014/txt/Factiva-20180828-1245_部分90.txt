BHP Billiton Ltd. may announce a spinoff of assets estimated to be worth as much as US$12-billion
next week, as the world's biggest mining company casts aside operations acquired in the 2001
purchase of Billiton PLC.
Directors will consider a structure to focus BHP on its four main products, including iron ore and
petroleum, when they meet next week, and announce any decisions immediately, the Melbourne based
company said Friday. It has already sold assets worth US$5.2-billion since January 2012 as part of
plans to simplify its portfolio.

"The market will be quite well predisposed to it and it probably adds some value to the BHP story," said
Brenton Saunders, a Sydney-based investment analyst with BT Investment Management Ltd., which
manages about A$64-billion (US$60-billion) and holds BHP shares. "The devil is in the detail, it will
depend on which assets are included and which aren't."
Focusing BHP on iron ore, copper, coal and petroleum projects that stretch from Australia to the
Americas and generated about 85% of its sales last year, will raise free cash flow, help boost
production growth and deliver stronger return on investment, chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said in
a May speech. Mr. Mackenzie, appointed in February 2013, also identified potash as a potential fifth
unit.

"The board has continued to study various structural alternatives, including at its meeting this week,"
the company said in Friday's statement. "A demerger of a selection of assets is our preferred option."
A spinoff that included nickel, manganese and aluminum operations, which span Australia, South
Africa and Colombia, a South African coal unit and the Cannington lead and silver mine, may be worth
as much as US$12-billion, according to a valuation Friday from CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.
Such a restructuring would be the largest since the A$3.3-billion spinoff of its steel unit in 2002. A
demerged company will probably be based mainly around former Billiton assets, Glyn Lawcock, an
analyst at UBS AG in Sydney, said in a July 14 note to clients. A new company would likely have a
primary listing in Australia and may also be traded in both the U.K. and South Africa, Mr. Lawcock said.
Mining companies are cutting costs and sharpening portfolios as commodity prices retreat and after
poorly timed acquisitions in a decade-long US$614-billion investment spree led to asset writedowns
and management clear-outs. Investors including
BlackRock Inc.'s Evy Hambro, who manages the US$8-billion World Mining Fund, have urged
producers to refrain from costly growth projects and focus on shareholder returns.

coal that no longer fit Mackenzie's strategy of focusing on four main commodities. BHP spokeswoman
Eleanor Nichols declined to comment on which assets may be included in any demerger.
Chief financial officer Graham Kerr may run the spinoff company from headquarters in Perth with a
portfolio that includes BHP's West Australian nickel unit and the Cannington mine, the Australian
Financial Review reported Friday. BHP's Mr. Nichols declined to comment on the report.
Creating a smaller collection of operations with long lifespans may be a catalyst for further productivity
savings, Mr. Mackenzie said in May.
In 2011, as China devoured everything from iron ore to copper to feed economic expansion, BHP's
return on invested capital was 35%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figure slumped to
13% two years later as Chinese growth slowed, the data show.

BHP's aluminum, manganese and nickel unit accounted for about 14% of revenue in the 12 months
ended June 30, 2013. That's down from about 30% in the year through June 2007, according to filings.
Revenue from iron ore has risen from about 12% to 31% over the same period Bloomberg News
