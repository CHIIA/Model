Optimism and new markets have led to a Hunter Valley meat processor calling for one hundred new
workers.
Scone abattoir has stepped in to help address rising unemployment from the coal industry downturn in
the Hunter Valley.

Hunter Valley Quality Meats, have launched a significant recruitment campaign to take on local workers.
The move comes with a $40 million upgrade of the meatworks on the drawing board to tap processed
beef demand from China, the United States, Japan and Indonesia.

Abattoir general manager Peter Allen says 100 workers are wanted for an immediate start.

"Someone that's fit and keen and got an open mind, a good work ethic. It's about taking an opportunity,"
he said.

"We will be providing training in hands-on tutoring.

"We have certified training that's recognised through the meat industry.

"So, someone that comes without an pre-requisite skills may start in a labouring-type position.

"We will offer them the opportunity to up skill."

Hunter Valley Quality Meats is part of the Primo Group that's expected to be sold to the Brazil based JSB
processor for $1.45 billion dollars.
The expected purchase appears to fit in with the JBS company's global strategy to expand in the
value-added product category.
