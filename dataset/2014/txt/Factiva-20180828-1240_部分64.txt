Investment bank Nomura's Australian arm has gone deeper into the red with a 13.8 per cent hike in
losses for 2014 to $27.1 million – the fifth consecutive year it hasn't made a profit.
But its local chief operating officer says he's not concerned and business is picking up.

The result was driven by a 37.7 per cent collapse in revenue in 2014 to $31.6 million, partly offset by
an $18 million fall in costs, including drops in commissions and floor brokerage paid, lower
equipment and IT costs and fewer employees, according to financial statements lodged with
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

Commissions and brokerage fees it paid were $390,794 in the 2014 financial year compared to
$2.7 million in 2013, equipment and IT more than halved to $1.6 million and staff costs fell by about
$8 million to $34.5 million.

In June 2013, Nomura Australia emulated many global investment banks and culled most of its
equities sales staff here, losing about 30 people.
Its main businesses in Australia are now its investment banking, M&A and debt advisory and its
markets business in fixed income and equity trading.

The result of the cuts is an improvement on 2012-13, when its loss increased by 22.8 per cent
to $23.8  million.
Nomura Australia's chief administrator, David Cummins, moved from Hong Kong to Australia in
2012. He said he could not recall the last time Nomura made a profit in Australia.

He said this was not deliberate to reduce taxes – which have been zero since 2009 due to no profits
booked, but just a result of their "global booking model" that many investment banks employ. This
means where revenue and profits are recorded can vary greatly from year to year depending on
where deals originated and which of the investment bank's teams did the work.
"A lot of our deals are cross-border deals. If we do an outbound M&A, revenue can get recognised in
a different market's business," he said.

"The loss isn't something that causes us too much concern. This year is proving to be quite a good
one for us. [2015] year to date is tracking towards a smaller financial loss. We may see some better
financial numbers, but I think people are quite comfortable about where we are."

He said Nomura had done a lot of Kangaroo bond deals (offshore issuers into Australian market)
pushing it up to third ranked in this.
It has also worked on several big M&A deals, including IOOF in its acquisition of Shadforth Financial
Group and is involved in $5 billion worth of announced transactions and announced "potential"

Estates.

Nomura Australia accounts back to 2008 show revenue is volatile as it is dependent on the number of
deals it works on.
It did make a profit of $4.5 million in 2007-08 financial year, even though revenue was a lot lower
than in recent years.
That profit plunged to a $60.4 million loss for the year ending March 2009 at the height of the
financial crisis. This was quickly pegged back to a $6 million loss in 2009-10, before falling again in
2010-11 to a $46 million loss then to a $19.4 million loss in 2011-12.
