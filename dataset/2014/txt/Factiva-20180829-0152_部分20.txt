0405 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse is maintaining its Outperform rating and A$5.70 target on Telstra
(TLS.AU) after the company announced the sale of a 70% stake in Sensis to Platinum Equity for A$454
million (US$408.6 million). The broker says Telstra has recognized the need for a further major
restructuring, which will be easier to carry out under a different ownership structure. It adds that there
could be upside to Telstra's remaining 30% stake if earnings can be stabilized under the new structure.
Credit Suisse also notes that the sale adds to the pot available for acquisitions or capital management.
TLS last flat at A$5.26. (david.rogers@wsj.com)

0355 GMT [Dow Jones] Barclays says nickel looks undervalued with the long-awaited Indonesian ore
export ban coming into force this past weekend, as even though government officials left room for major
exceptions following last-minute meetings, it would not prevent a significant drop in ore exports. The
Southeast Asian nation is a key supplier of feedstock used to produce nickel, aluminum and copper, and
"if the ban remains in place for long, it will create a supply shock," the house says. High nickel stocks will
be "a finite buffer...it looks as though the market will be unable to source Indonesian nickel ore or bauxite
after Jan. 12 as the ban goes ahead in full force--for now, at least." There is a serious risk that the supply
of nickel pig iron by Indonesia to China will begin to contract in the second half of this year, with the
quality of China's stockpiles [in preparation for the ban] unknown, as well as the size of the cushion, it
adds. LME three-month nickel is up 0.9% at $13,975/ton, the highest level so far this year.

0302 GMT [Dow Jones] Most currencies in Asia emerging markets rose against the U.S. dollar on
Monday as the fall in U.S. Treasury yields on Friday's disappointing U.S. December nonfarm payrolls
reduced concerns over capital outflows. The Indonesian rupiah is likely to be the main winner on Monday
given changes to the mineral-ore export ban made on Sunday, Credit Agricole CIB says. Regulations
were significantly diluted to allow a three-year extension for low-level concentrate exports. Most
Indonesian ore exports meet the requirements--except for nickel and bauxites, the bank says. The
Thailand baht should underperform given the gradual escalation of the political crisis in Thailand, the
bank says. "We expect the blockade of Bangkok to have an increasingly negative impact as the month
progresses and the THB should remain under pressure." The spot USD/IDR was recently at
12020--down from 12155 late Friday. The USD/THB is at 33.01--up from 32.96 late Friday.

0235 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia's benchmark JSX stock index rises 1.6% early Monday to 4322.7,
followed closely by the Philippines PSEi, which is 1.4% higher at 5927.8. The markets lead a positive
morning in Southeast Asia with sentiment buoyed by poor jobs data late Friday in the U.S. An official
measure of employment in the U.S. found that only 74,000 jobs were added in December, below a
revised 241,000 in November. The data is likely to support a more cautious approach at the U.S Federal
Reserve to reductions in its bond-buying program, a policy that has propelled markets in Southeast Asia
in recent years. Indonesia's banks perform strongly, with PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI.JK) up 2.1%
and PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI.JK) gaining 5.1%. In Manila, Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. (MBT.PH) gains
3.6%, while retail mall operator SM Prime Holdings (SMPH.PH) is up 2.8%. (jake.watts@wsj.com)

nonfarm payrolls data helping to ease fears of further tapering of the monthly bond buying program by
the Federal Reserve. "Investor perception is that further tapering could be delayed as a result of the
data," Chintan Karnani, a director at Insignia Consultants, says in a report. While he says that the
direction for gold and silver is "bullish", prices have to convincingly break above $1,254/oz for another
big upward move. He expects physical demand from China to remain robust ahead of the country's New
Year celebrations. Spot gold is at $1,251.10/oz, up $2.50, and silver is at $20.24/oz, up 7 cents from its
previous close. (arpan.mukherjee@wsj.com)
0200 GMT [Dow Jones] China yuan hit a new high as the central bank set the yuan fixing at the
strongest level historically, after the U.S. published a disappointing December jobs report. The USD/CNY
pair is at 6.0466 after hitting 6.0443, the strongest level for the yuan under the current system, vs. 6.0521
Friday close. The central parity is set at 6.0950 vs. 6.1008 Friday. "Though the dollar fell broadly, I'm
surprised to see the yuan rise so quickly in the morning after the central bank asked banks to cancel all
the 6.0500 level trades Friday," says a Shanghai-based foreign bank trader. He says the pair has support
at around 6.0450. Offshore, one-year USD/CNY NDFs are down at 6.1000/6.1050 from 6.1126/6.1163
late Friday. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)
0142 GMT [Dow Jones] Crude-oil futures are steady in early Asian trade Monday, with financial markets
digesting Friday's disappointing U.S. jobs report that weighed on the U.S. dollar and boosted oil prices.
Nymex WTI crude gained $1.06 on Friday but ended $1.24 lower from a week earlier, while Brent crude
gained 36 cents last week. ABN Amro says the weakness in the labour market report is weather-related
and fundamental strength in the economy will re-assert itself before long, boosting investor sentiment,
risky assets and the dollar. Meanwhile, a sum of $550 million has been unblocked for Iran, its first
installment under a six-month landmark nuclear deal with the West that is making progress. Money
managers slashed bets on higher crude oil prices to the lowest level in more than a month, according to
CFTC data for the week ended January 7. Nymex crude is flat at $92.72/bbl, Brent crude is up 9 cents at
$107.34/bbl. (eric.yep@wsj.com)

2025 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY is likely to consolidate between 103.80 and 104.20 Monday after
a kneejerk move lower on weaker-than-expected non farm payrolls data Friday, says Stuart Ive, senior
client advisor at OM Financial. "Retail sales out of the U.S. will be the focus of the week...The market
expectation on that is on a headline figure of around 0.2% and if it comes in significantly higher we will
see the U.S. dollar start retracing some of that loss." The pair is at 103.90 vs 104.10 late Friday in New
York. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com)
