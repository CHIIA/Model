The decline in Asian stocks over the past three months accelerated Monday, with Taiwan and the
Philippines each tumbling 2.8%, as worries over slowing global growth weighed on shares.

The two markets each marked their biggest one-day slide this year, sending the MSCI Asia ex-Japan
index to levels previously seen around seven months ago in local-currency terms.

Taiwan's Taiex was the worst performer among the major Asian indexes, dragged down by losses in
technology and food stocks. The index lost 2.8% to 8711.39, catching up to a global selloff at the end
of last week after being closed Friday.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing slid 3.6%, MediaTek fell 4.1% and Delta Electronics was down
2.6%, as investors fretted about earnings in the technology sector. That stemmed from semiconductor
manufacturer Microchip Technology's warning last week that it would report disappointing sales for the
September quarter and its suggestion of "another industry correction."

Among food shares, Wei-Chuan Foods plunged 7% limit down and Uni-President Enterprises fell
5.4%. The companies, subsidiaries of Taiwanese food producer Ting Hsin International Group, were
found to have used oil unfit for human consumption and their shares were under pressure as calls
mounted for a consumer boycott of their products.

The Philippines' PSEi fell 2.8% to 6968.09. Analysts said worries about global growth have added to
concerns about high valuations, but they cited no particular reason for the loss. Among the
large-capitalization stocks, real-estate and food conglomerate Alliance Global Group was down 5%,
power and banking conglomerate Aboitiz Equity Ventures fell 4.9% and real-estate company Ayala
Land closed 4.6% lower.
The latest trade data in China got a mixed reaction from investors. The Shanghai Composite Index
slipped 0.4% to 2366.01, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.2% to 23143.38.
The figures showed China's exports rising 15.3% in September from a year earlier, beating analysts'
expectations and up from August's 9.4% increase. The trade surplus, which narrowed to $31 billion
from $49.8 billion in August, however, lagged behind expectations of a $42 billion surplus. The
appetite in global markets for Chinese goods is strong, although investors are still worried about the
pace of domestic economic growth in China.

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi lost 0.7% to 1927.21 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.63%
to 5155.50, while India's Sensex gained 0.3% to 26384.07. Markets in Japan were closed for a
national holiday.
