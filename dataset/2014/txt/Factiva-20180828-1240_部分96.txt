BHP Billiton Leaves Investors in a Spin

BHP Billiton was trying to pull off a high-wire act. Instead, the Anglo-Australian miner took a wobble.

BHP's London-listed shares fell 4% after the miner, which reported full-year results Tuesday, said it
would spin off a collection of noncore aluminum, manganese, nickel and coal assets. BHP's shares have
rallied on anticipation of the spinoff. But Tuesday's adverse reaction also reflected an unsteady
performance from the miner.
Spinning off subscale assets should create a simpler, more efficient company, a welcome break with
mining's empire-building past. BHP's remaining businesses over the past 10 years have grown more
quickly and been more profitable than the company as a whole.
The miner pledged to find a further $3.5 billion in cost savings and efficiency gains by 2017, partly
mitigating lost earnings. The noncore assets generated about $2.1 billion in earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization in the year to June, or about 6.5% of BHP's total. At the average
margin over the past decade, with prices for those commodities currently depressed, the assets made
$3.4 billion, about 10% of last year's total.

But two other factors knocked BHP off balance. First, there is likely to be angst about the spinoff's
structure. Both Australian and U.K. shareholders will receive stock in the new company, which will be
listed in Australia and South Africa. That is designed to treat all investors equally. But the mechanism
means London shareholders who aren't able to hold overseas equities will have to sell, likely weighing
on the new company's stock in its early weeks of trading. Both sets of shareholders, then, have reason
to be wary.

Second, and more important, the absence of a widely expected share buyback is a real blow. Instead,
BHP said it would maintain and grow the absolute level of its dividend after the spinoff, meaning its
payout ratio would rise from last year's 48%. Investors this year have bet that falling capital spending
and improving free cash flow around the mining sector would mean an imminent ramp-up in returns.
BHP's balance sheet, with net debt of $25.8 billion, is only just approaching the point at which the
company suggested it could return capital. That serves to underline that BHP's cuts to investment and
debt reduction have been less striking than at rival Rio Tinto.

In the longer term, BHP boasts a more-diversified portfolio with a better growth pipeline than does Rio
Tinto. But BHP's latest growth announcement trumpeted its ability to lift iron-ore production in Western
Australia to 290 million metric tons a year, adding 65 million tons for a cost of less than $3.3 billion.
Investors wanting to bet on low-cost volume growth in Australian iron ore already have an option: Rio
Tinto, which is trading at a 15% discount to BHP on a price/earnings basis. That is one place
shareholders may turn while BHP regains its poise.

Sprint's Price Cuts Look

Page332of343©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Like Too Little, Too Soon

Sprint isn't being nearly disruptive enough.

The No. 3 U.S. carrier by subscribers announced new family plans late Monday, set to replace its
puzzling "Framily" pricing arrangement later this week. The new plans offer more data for the money
than those of Verizon Communications and AT&T and even undercut T-Mobile US in some instances.

For Sprint, whose current prices are higher than peers' on the most popular plans, the move should at
least slow its recent flood of subscriber defections. The carrier has lost a net 1.2 million of the most
valuable postpaid subscribers over the past four quarters.

But the price cuts should mean lower margins and may not move the subscriber needle that much,
particularly as Sprint's network still trails the rest of the industry. This is why many had expected Sprint to
wait to lower prices.

Sprint's new chief executive, Marcelo Claure, who replaced Dan Hesse earlier this month, was
apparently unwilling to let the subscriber drain continue at this pace, though. The move comes against
the backdrop of intensifying competition, mostly spurred by T-Mobile and after Sprint gave up on a
possible merger with its smaller rival.

Under the new plans, a family of four can get 20 gigabytes of shared data for $160 a month -- the same
price AT&T and Verizon charge for 10 gigabytes. T-Mobile charges $100 for 10 gigabytes.

The new plans cost about $1 a month less on average than T-Mobile's unsubsidized plans, according to
New Street Research. By comparison, Sprint's current prices are $7 to $10 a month higher than those of
AT&T and Verizon and $10 to $15 above T-Mobile on the most popular plans.

Sprint is also offering a promotion, from Aug. 22 to Sept. 30, under which it will waive access fees,
bringing the $160 plan down to $100. In addition, it will pay up to $350 in early-termination fees for
customers leaving rivals and signing up for one of its higher-data plans.

This may lure some customers. But they might not like what they find at Sprint. The carrier's network
remains well behind those of rivals and won't catch up to them for at least another year, New Street
says. It will be even longer before Sprint can claim network superiority.

For Sprint investors, lower prices alone won't get it out of its current jam.

An Overlooked Play on Alibaba
Investors looking for Alibaba treasure shouldn't forget that some of it lies outside the company's cave.
The promise of the Chinese e-commerce giant becoming the largest-ever initial share sale in the U.S.
already has boosted the stocks of its major shareholders, Yahoo and SoftBank.

But Alibaba has minor shareholders, too, which often are overlooked. One of these offers perhaps the
best opportunity to play this IPO.
China Dongxiang Group is a Hong Kong-listed sportswear maker with a market capitalization of $1.13
billion. In 2011, it spent $100 million to buy a 0.31% stake in Alibaba through a private-equity fund
co-founded by Alibaba chief Jack Ma. This stake will certainly fetch more today.

Dongxiang shares are up 17% this year in anticipation of the Alibaba IPO, yet that hasn't captured the
company's overall worth.

To calculate Dongxiang's full value, start with its sportswear business, anchored by nearly 1,200
Kappa-brand retail stores in China. Its peers trade at about nine times this year's estimated earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as measured by FactSet. Slapping this multiple
onto Dongxiang's sportswear line yields $199 million.
Next, Dongxiang sat on $178.3 million of cash as of Dec. 31, to which it has since added $4.8 million
by disposing of shares in a U.S. apparel firm. It also owns bank treasury products, plus investment
funds. These mostly liquid assets total $886 million. The company holds no debt.
To this, add Alibaba. If Mr. Ma manages to get a $200 billion valuation, the higher end of market
estimates, Dongxiang's stake comes to $620 million. That means the sum of this company's parts

Page333of343©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.would be worth 52% more than its market cap, though that is before applying a discount for being a
holding company and any possible taxes.
A more moderate $150 billion Alibaba valuation still leaves a 39% gap between the value of
Dongxiang's assets and its shares. Even assuming Dongxiang's sportswear business is worth zero, and
that its other investments are somewhat impaired, it still appears the shares undervalue the Alibaba
stake.

Such a wide gap should close, as Alibaba's market value becomes apparent closer to its listing.
Dongxiang says that it may unload some of its shares after the IPO. If it doesn't, the stock will likely
become a smaller tracking version of Alibaba.

Unlike Yahoo or SoftBank, Dongxiang's regular business is less important to its overall value. That
leaves Dongxiang's fortune hitched to Alibaba. The e-commerce giant doesn't even have to reach a
supercharged valuation for Dongxiang investors to make out like bandits.

Overheard

Be careful what you wish for. While tighter labor markets would boost wage growth, they also might cost
lives.

It turns out that paydays can be dangerous. A new paper from the Bonn-based Institute for the Study of
Labor finds a significant increase in mortality on the day workers receive salaries. "Income Receipt and
Mortality" takes its bearings from public-sector workers in Sweden -- a sample that covers 22% of the
country's workforce.

The lethal effects of paydays are quite large. The paper finds a 23% increase in total mortality on the day
salary payments arrive.

This isn't offset by a subsequent decline to below-average mortality, which means paydays are indeed
contributing to additional mortality. Increased consumption of alcohol or drugs doesn't play a significant
role, according to the paper's authors.

In other words, it isn't the wages of sin that are death. It may be the wages of wages.
