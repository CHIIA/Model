TNG - Significant Graphite Concentrate Grades
Achieves At Mount Peake - 4/12/2014

TNG Limited (ASX: TNG) is pleased to advise that it has
upgraded the potential for an economic graphite
resource at its 100%-owned Mount Peake
Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project in the Northern
Territory, subject to further drilling and test-work, after
receiving highly favorable results from flotation
test-work.

Flotation test-work completed on two composite
samples from recent drilling at the BGC1 Prospect at
Mount Peake have returned graphite concentrate grades
above 90.0%, which is an excellent result.

Diamond drill core samples were taken from the two
targets, BGC1 and G34, which were drilled in
August/September at Mount Peake (Figure 1).

Details of the two graphite prospects were reported in
the Company’s ASX Announcement on 20 August
2014, and whole coordinates are detailed in

Table 1

Drilling details and geological assessment was reported
to the ASX in the Announcement dated 17 September
2014. Assay results are now to hand and
beneficiation/flotation testwork has been completed, with
both sets of results presented below.

The BGC1 target is a very large (1,000m x 600m) and
strong late-time Electromagnetic (EM) conductor, as
outlined by TNG’s 2012 HELITEMsurvey, shown on
Figure 2.

Previous drilling by TNG encountered a thick graphitic
interval (greater than40m) in reverse circulation (RC)
drilling (see ASX Announcement – 21 October 2010),
and preliminary metallurgical test work was encouraging

Page12of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.with the graphite proving amenable to simple flotation.
However, core samples were needed for definitive
metallurgical characterization to assess the potential for
economic grades to be achieved.

At the BGC1 target, the graphite was encountered over
a broad zone from 240 to 286m (see ASX
Announcement – 17 September 2014). Visually, graphite
content is reasonably consistent throughout this 46m
interval of dark grey graphitic and pyritic silicified schist
(Figure 3).

The mineralization correlates well with the position and
depth of the EM Conductor modeled from the HELITEM
survey data (Figure 2). The other hole on Figure 2 is
ARD1, which was drilled in 2004 by Discovery Nickel.
TNG re-logged this hole, observing graphite between
205m and 270m and assayed the core for graphite with
the results presented below.

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)
technique for the determination of the chemical
composition of complex inorganic materials

Łukasz Łazarek ; Arkadiusz J. Antończak ; Michał R.
Wójcik ; Paweł E. Kozioł ; Bogusz Stępak ; Krzysztof M.
Abramski

Abstract:

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a fast,
fully optical method, that needs little or no sample
preparation. In this technique qualitative and quantitative
analysis is based on comparison. The determination of
composition is generally based on the construction of a
calibration curve namely the LIBS signal versus the
concentration of the analyte. Typically, to calibrate the
system, certified reference materials with known
elemental composition are used. Nevertheless, such
samples due to differences in the overall composition
with respect to the used complex inorganic materials
can influence significantly on the accuracy. There are
also some intermediate factors which can cause
imprecision in measurements, such as optical
absorption, surface structure, thermal conductivity etc.

Page14of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.This paper presents the calibration procedure performed
with especially prepared pellets from the tested
materials, which composition was previously defined.
We also proposed methods of post-processing which
allowed for mitigation of the matrix effects and for a
reliable and accurate analysis. This technique was
implemented for determination of trace elements in
industrial copper concentrates standardized by
conventional atomic absorption spectroscopy with a
flame atomizer. A series of copper flotation concentrate
samples was analyzed for contents of three elements,
that is silver, cobalt and vanadium. It has been shown
that the described technique can be used to qualitative
and quantitative analyses of complex inorganic
materials, such as copper flotation concentrate. ©

The Industry

What is Vanadium?

Vanadium is soft, but adds strength and hardness when
alloyed with other metals such as iron to produce high
strength steel which has structural applications for gas
and oil drilling platforms, pipelines, tools steel, armour
plate, sections of the motor vehicle industry and the
aircraft industry as well as for reinforcing bars in
high-rise building and construction. Non-steel uses
include welding and in alloys used in nuclear
engineering and superconductors. Vanadium chemicals
and catalysts are used in the manufacture of sulphuric
acid and the desulphurisation of sour gas and oil.
Vanadium compounds also have potential to be used in
fuel cells.

Only 29 per cent of the world’s production of vanadium
is derived as primary production from mining and
processing of magnetite ores while about 56 per cent is
recovered from slag as a by-product of steel making and
about 15 per cent is recovered from waste ash and oil
residues.

Australia’s EDR of vanadium amounts to about 2.5
million tonne which make up about 15 per cent of the
world’s resources. Most of Australia’s EDR is hosted in
mafic/ultramafic intrusions with a minor proportion in
sandstone hosted uranium deposits. Considerable
additional resources occur in weathered oil shale
deposits near Julia Creek in north Queensland.

Vanadium was produced at Windimurra mine (Western
Australia) in 2002 and 2003. Vanadium exploration
activity in recent years has been largely directed at
mafic/ultramafic intrusions and to the upgrading of
known resources. Recent resource and exploration
drilling has been undertaken at Speedway Dome, Unaly
Hill, and Victory Bore in Western Australia, Mount Peake
in the Northern Territory and at the Hawkwood deposit in
Queensland.

Page15of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Vanadium is associated with some mafic/ultramafic
rocks which are described in Archean and Proterozoic
Resource Packages.

Prices for Vanadium

Vanadium prices have fluctuated during the past
decade, with sharp rises and equally sharp declines
over short periods.

Over the last three years (2009 to 2011) prices have
ranged as low as below $US20 per kg to almost as high
as $US35 per kg.

Leading Companies

Atlantic Limited – (ASX: ATI)

Atlantic is the 100% owner of Midwest Vanadium Pty
Ltd, the Windimurra vanadium project. The Windimurra
project is a world scale vanadium and haematite iron
ore project that is currently in production and is
expected to reach full capacity of 6,300 tonnes per
annum of contained vanadium in 2013.
The Company is also pursuing bauxite development
opportunities in Vietnam.

Atlantic will continue to build upon this foundation to
examine further opportunities to develop a portfolio of
diversified world class resources projects.

Windimurra Vanadium Project

Atlantic acquired 100% of the Windimurra Vanadium
Project in 2010. After achieving first production in
January 2012, Atlantic is now accelerating towards full
production of 6,300 tonnes per annum of contained
vanadium in the first calendar quarter of 2013.

Independent research by CPM shows that the Project
will be a lowest quartile cash cost vanadium producer as
a result of the following:
the attractive transaction metrics negotiated by Atlantic
that fundamentally restructure the capital base of
Midwest Vanadium Pty Ltd (MVPL) and deliver the
benefit of over $500 million of prior capital expenditure
for a net present value of $68 million of retained debt;

consolidation of ownership that will streamline the
management of the Project under the control of one
group;
the acquisition of the crushing and beneficiation plant
that will deliver material long-term cost savings;

identification of the haematite by-product revenue
stream opportunity, thereby releasing significant further
cash credits for the Project, driving costs into the lowest
quartile; and

Renegotiation of key supply contracts.
New selective mining opportunities that have the
potential to release further material cost savings.

Page16of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Windimurra production is expected to meet about 7% of
world demand, and it is expected global demand growth
will require the equivalent of a "new Windimurra" to
come on stream almost every year. Windimurra will also
have the advantage of being one of the world's low cost
vanadium producers.
Australian vanadium sold to consumers in the US is
subject to a Free Trade Agreement while vanadium
producers from China, South Africa and Russia are
subject to anti-dumping duties of between 3.5% and
100%.

Location

The Windimurra Vanadium Project is located
approximately 600 kilometres north of Perth and 80
kilometres by road from Mount Magnet in Western
Australia.

The Windimurra deposit lies within the eastern flank of
the large (greater than2,000km²) Windimurra intruded
layered gabbro complex, which is part of the regional
Murchison granite-greenstone province.

Development Plan
Following completion of the acquisition of the Project,
MVPL began preparations for the recommencement of
construction at the Project. This is targeted to begin in
early calendar 2011 with a view to achieving first
production in mid 2011.
At completion, MVPL completed the acquisition of the
existing accommodation camp at the Project site,
providing enhanced flexibility to manage the
construction and commissioning the Project in the
months ahead.
MVPL has now engaged PinC Group Pty Ltd (PinC), an
experienced and well resourced project management
and project services group, to work with MVPL
management to oversee all aspects of construction
completion, including developing MVPL's contracting
strategy and monitoring the work of individual
construction contractors following appointment.

PinC recently completed the successful Utah Point
expansion project for the Port Hedland Port Authority
and Atlantic is delighted with the early stage discipline
and processes that PinC bring to the Project.

Key construction contracts are defined into three distinct
work streams:

Structural, mechanical and piping;

Electrical and instrumentation; and

Civil work.

MVPL has made further progress on the implementation
of its strategy to monetise the stockpile of haematite at
Windimurra and the approximately 1 million tonnes per
annum of haematite produced by the Project once it is
operational. In particular, constructive discussions have
been held with the logistic supply chain partners

Page17of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.required to deliver the product into the seaborne world
market.

MVPL is also focused on building the management team
at Windimurra and a dedicated MVPL recruitment
resource has been appointed to oversee this important
component of the Project.

Geological Studies

Mineral Resources

The inherited mineral resource base of the project, was
based on a mineral resource estimate from a 6 kilometre
identified strike length and reported in December 2008.
The total resource was 176.59 million tonnes at 0.46%
V2O5, using a lower cut-off of 0.275% V2O5.

To improve the geological knowledge of the targeted
start-up mining area (a cutback of the exiting pit) an
infill reverse circulation drilling program of 3,400 metres
was undertaken between November 2010 and January
2011. The drilling allowed better definition of grade
distribution within the stacked flow packages; the
identification of enriched grade zones (greater than
0.52% V2O5); definition of the weathering and hence
beneficiation recovery profiles; and the extension of the
known resource base down to a depth of 150 metres
(previously identified to 90 metres).

Based on the drilling results, a revised global mineral
resource estimate was compiled to JORC compliance
standards and was released in March 2011, resulting in
a 19% increase in the mineral resource base of the
project to 209.97 million tonnes at 0.47% V2O5, using a
lower cut-off of 0.275% V2O5.

Ore Reserves
The inherited ore reserve base of the project, on the
successful completion of the project acquisition by
Atlantic Ltd in September 2010, was based on an ore
reserve estimate from an identified 3.7 kilometres core
of the 6 kilometres resource base reported in December
2008. The total ore reserve was 97.8 million tonnes at
0.46% V2O5, using a lower cut-off of 0.275% V2O5. The
life of mine was 24 years based on 4 million tonnes per
annum feed rates.
A new ore reserve study was undertaken in 2011, using
the improved mineral resource position and also using
the techniques of up to four (4) selective mining grade
bins dependant of weathering profile, with interim
stockpiling and reclaim of the lower grade proportions, to
further optimise the mine schedule and to improve the
head grade. The results of the study confirmed that a
10% increase in head grade was achieved using these

Page18of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.techniques for the first 10 years of the operation, from
the 2008 position of 0.47% V2O5 to 0.51% V2O5. The
pit designs were also extended to a depth of 150 metres
where viable, and were optimally sequenced to ensure
optimal selectively mined grades were supplied to the
plant in priority of grade distributions.
The new ore reserve position resulted in a 30% increase
from that reported in 2008, due to the underlying
improved mineral resource base and the use of the
above selective mining sequencing techniques. The life
of mine was also extended to 28 years based on 4
million tonnes per annum feed rates.

years, to a maximum depth of 155 metres.

Exploration
The acquisition of the Windimurra project included a
package of 100% owned mining and exploration
tenements covering a total strike length of 27 kilometres
of prospective ground for titano-vanadium, and
magnetite based iron ore-style mineralization. The
current mineral resource base on which the Windimurra
Vanadium mine and processing facility is being
commissioned is located on the northern 6 kilometre
corridor within this. Of this 6 kilometre strike that has
been drilled, the current open-pit mine design extracts
an inner 4.2 kilometres. This leaves an extensive 21
kilometre strike package unexplored to the south.

A high resolution aero-magnetic response survey was
undertaken over the ground in 2007, with further
detailed fill-in lines undertaken in 2008. The responses
showed that the high magnetic gabbros associated with
the lower layered sequence of Shepherd’s Discordant
Zone, which hosts the titano-vanadium horizon at
Windimurra, extends through the acquired southerly
tenement holdings.

Exploration of the region has had a chequered and
limited history, with several companies undertaking low
level reconnaissance surveys (Hawkstone Minerals and
Ferrovanadium Corp in the 1970’s and early 1980’s; an
Alcoa Australia and BHP Minerals Joint Venture in the
mid 1980’s and Precious Metals Australia in 1989). All
exploration and resource development works were
undertaken within the northern 6 kilometre strike length
that now forms the Windimurra Vanadium mine.

Page19of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Atlantic initiated the first exploration on this greenfields
ground in January 2011, via 5 traverse lines of reverse
circulation drilling, 5 kilometres apart, across the high
magnetic signature. This scout drill program was not
designed nor intended to return a quantifiable mineral
resource, but to be used as a tool in confirming the
overall geological setting and weathering states, and to
return an understanding into the broad V205, Fe and
TiO2 grade distributions within the belt. As such, it was
designed as a preliminary stepping stone in the
development of a future targeted strategy for these
tenements.

The scout program was successful in confirming the
continuous presence of the main vanadium-magneto
horizon as expressed in the Shepherd’s Discordant
Zone (SDZ) at Windimurra, for the strike length of the
southerly tenement holdings. Widths of mineralization
and grades of vanadium bearing units were comparable
to Windimurra for the first 9 kilometres south of the
proposed current life of mine pit design, and then
reduced to approximately half the width by the southern
extent was reached, whilst the vanadium grade was
maintained. A second peripheral vanadium-magneto
horizon was located some 400 metres west of the main
SDZ. This unit had an average of 7 metres and an
identified strike length of 4.7 kilometres, in the southern
section of the tenement holdings.

Atlantic is committed to future systematic further
exploration of this highly prospective southern extension
of the known Windimurra deposit. Future programs will
include follow up exploration and definition of resources
based on the previously identified 0.80% V2O5
outcropping massive magnetite hosted beds that
outcrop, as well as specialized steel market ore
products within the belt.

PRODUCTION & SALES REPORT MONTH OF
OCTOBER 2014
Windimurra Operations

Production of vanadium at Windimurra has been
suspended since February following a major fire in the
beneficiation plant.

The damage to the beneficiation plant was extensive
and further detailed structural engineering demonstrated
that the most cost and time effective option for the
rebuild of the area was to demolish the existing structure
and rebuild the plant from its foundations.

Demolition work in the beneficiation area and the front
end engineering and design work for the beneficiation
plant rebuild have been completed.

In early October, Atlantic awarded the design and
construct EPC contract for the plant rebuild to Primero
Group.
Primero Group has extensive knowledge of the
Windimurra project and has previously provided
successful construction services to the Company.
Primero has now mobilised to site, established its
construction infrastructure at Windimurra and
commenced foundation works. In parallel with this site
based work, the detailed final design work is continuing
in Perth.

Fabrication of steel and plate work for the rebuild is
underway at local workshops in and around Perth. This
fabrication work has been sub-contracted to a number of
specialist fabricators to expedite the work and facilitate
the rebuild in the shortest possible time frame.

Orders for other critical components such as pumps and
valves have now been placed, and long lead time items
ordered early in the schedule continue to be delivered
as expected.

Atlantic expects that reconstruction of the beneficiation
plant will be completed in an industry leading time frame
of just over one year from the date of the fire.

Insurance
The Company holds comprehensive industrial special
risks insurance that covers both the material damage to
the beneficiation plant as a result of the fire and the

Page21of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.related business interruption. The Company’s insurers
have granted indemnity for the fire and late in October,
Atlantic was advised that a further progress payment
from the insurers of $13 million would be made. This
progress payment has now been received, bringing the
total insurance proceeds received to date to $63 million.

Production and Sales

There was no production or sales of vanadium in
October.
Iron Ore

During the month, the Company continued discussions
with prospective customers for its iron ore products,
with particular emphasis on niche market opportunities
for MVPL’s high titanium furnace protection iron ore
lump product. Due to the current low market prices for
iron ore products, the Company chose to make no iron
ore sales during the month.

Business Review
As previously announced, the Company concluded a
thorough review of its business, encompassing a review
of the mine plan, the crushing, milling and beneficiation
(CMB) circuit and the refinery in July. This review was
based on the Company’s commissioning and operating
experience over the last two years, with particular
emphasis on the CMB circuit. The business review
demonstrated that following implementation of new
process plant flow sheet changes and the rebuild of the
fire damaged beneficiation plant, the Windimurra project
is expected to produce approximately 4,800 –5,200
tonnes per annum of contained vanadium at steady
state. As part of this review, the Company has also
developed a plan to right-size the business to take into
account these steady state production levels.

Notwithstanding that the expected steady state
production levels are lower than was previously
envisaged for the Windimurra project, the business
review demonstrates a long-term sustainable future for
the business.

Discussions with Stakeholders

To fund the proposed capital expenditure and working
capital to implement the proposed process
improvements identified as part of the business review,
the Company will require additional funding. Atlantic is
currently in discussions with its stakeholders regarding
this additional funding as well as an appropriate longer
term capital structure for the business.

Extension of Forbearance
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary MVPL
has now entered into a new forbearance and support
agreement with the holders of a majority of MVPL’s
senior secured notes to extend the existing standstill
arrangements that ended on 14 November 2014 until 15
December 2014.

In conjunction with this new forbearance agreement,
MVPL also agreed to related amendments to the
existing

Page22of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.$29.7 million secured loan facility agreement with
Atlantic’s largest shareholder Droxford International
Limited (Droxford) to extend the maturity date of that
facility until 15 December 2014.

Under the forbearance agreement, the senior secured
note holders have agreed to continue the existing
standstill arrangements in relation to certain events of
default which have occurred under MVPL’s indenture,
including MVPL’s failure to deposit funds in its interest
reserve account and pay the February and August
interest payments on its senior secured notes until 15
December 2014.

The forbearance is subject to, among other things, there
being no further events of default under MVPL’s
indenture or the Droxford facility during the term of the
forbearance agreement. Under the forbearance
agreement, the note holders have also agreed with
MVPL to continue to use their good faith efforts to
negotiate and execute a definitive agreement among
MVPL and the supporting note holders to affect a
solvent restructuring of MVPL.

These arrangements provide further time for the
Company to continue discussions with its stakeholders
regarding approval for the additional funding required to
implement the Company’s new business plan as well as
an appropriate longer term capital structure for the
business. MVPL will shortly commence a related
consent process to implement technical indenture
amendments agreed as part of the new forbearance
agreement, including amendments that will allow the
Company to incur up to an additional $10 million in
permitted indebtedness if a restructuring agreement is
executed among MVPL and the supporting note holders.
This consent process is expected to conclude in
December.

ASX Suspension

Following the fire in the beneficiation plant on 4
February, the Company requested a voluntary
suspension in the trading of its securities. Atlantic
believes that it is appropriate for the suspension in the
trading of the Company’s securities to remain in place
given that the Company is in discussions regarding a
longer term restructure of the business.

Meekatharra Gold Project

(Reed 100%)
The Meekatharra Gold Project (“Project”) is situated in
Western Australia’s prolific Meekatharra – Wydgee
Greenstone Belt which is host to a number of
multimillion ounce deposits, including Mt Magnet (8
Moz) and Tuckabiana (1 Moz).

In 2011 GMK Exploration Pty Ltd (“GMKE”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Reed, acquired one of the most
fertile contiguous packages of land in this greenstone
belt. It has a strike of 110km, covering approximately
800 square kilometres and has produced in excess of
4.5 Moz of gold during the course of its history.

Strategically located in the centre of the project area is
the Group’s 3 million tonne per annum Bluebird CIL
processing plant. Co-located at Bluebird is support
infrastructure including administration offices,
workshops, laboratories, power station and a 190 room
accommodation village, all of which have an estimated
replacement cost in excess of $100 million.

Strategy

The Project comprises numerous open pit and
underground deposits across four primary project areas
which include Yaloginda, Paddys Flat, Reedys and
Meekatharra North. In line with the Group’s corporate

Page25of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.objectives of minimising risk whilst achieving an
acceptable financial return, the Project was designed to
be executed in three Stages:
a) Stage 1: Recommence Operations – planned as a
low risk development option involving mining of shallow
free milling Yaloginda ore bodies in what was envisaged
to be a 21 month development and production plan;
b) Stage 2: Operational Expansion – planned to exploit
the remaining 618,000 ounces of Reserves and see the
focus expand from open pit to both open pit and higher
grade underground production at Paddy’s Flat to the
north and Reedys to the south in addition to continuing
operations at Yaloginda; and

c) Stage 3: Increase Life of Mine – conversion of
remaining Resource ounces to Reserves through
advanced targeting and exploration techniques and the
identification of new Resources and Reserves with the
ultimate aim of delivering a sustainable 10 year mine
life.

TNG Limited – (ASX: TNG)

Western Australia.

TNG’s main focus is the evaluation and development of
its 100%-owned Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron
Project, located in the highly prospective Arunta
Geological Province some 80km north-east of Alice
Springs in the Northern Territory. Discovered by TNG in
early 2008, the Mount Peake Project comprises a
current JORC Indicated Resource of 140Mt grading
0.3% V205, 9% Ti02 and 35% Fe, making it one of the
largest of the known vanadium projects in Australia.

Work carried out by TNG to date has enabled the
Company to establish an Exploration Target1 of
500-700Mt grading 0.2-0.4% V205 and 25-35% Fe in
addition to the JORC resource, potentially making the
Mount Peake Vanadium Project one of the largest
vanadium deposits in the world.

A preliminary Scoping Study carried out by Snowden
Mining Industry Consultants in 2009 demonstrated
positive economics based on the Inferred Resource, and
a revised final Scoping Study is due to be released in
early 2011.

This Study is expected to confirm that the current JORC
resource can underpin a robust long-life operation based
on the use of a revolutionary hydrometallurgical process
developed jointly by TNG and Perth-based Metallurgical
consultants (METS) which enables all three products –
Vanadium, Titanium and Iron – to be economically
extracted.

The project is strategically located close to existing
infrastructure, including the Alice Springs-Darwin
Railway, Stuart Highway and the new LPG pipeline,
20km to its east.

Page26of262©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Vanadium is a “miracle metal” which is used to impart
strength, hardness and water resistance to steel, in the
manufacture of titanium alloys used in jet engines,
airframes and other high-end specialty materials, and in
the chemical industry, notably in batteries, plastic, glass
and pigments.

Steel accounts for over 85% of vanadium demand, with
consumption predicted to increase at similar rates to the
growth of the global steel industry – driven by the rapid
expansion of the Chinese economy and growing per
capita use and intensity of use of steel in the BRIC
economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China).

While its focus is the Mount Peake Project, TNG also
has a broad range of exploration projects in the Northern
Territory ranging from advanced projects with existing
resources, to green fields exploration. Its tenements
include exposure to a wide range of commodities
including gold, lead, zinc, nickel and copper.

These include the 100%-owned Manbarrum
Zinc-Lead-Silver Project, located 70km north-east of
Kununurra. The Manbarrum tenements cover a 52km
strike length of identified zinc-lead-silver mineralisation
of the Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) including a 36
million tonne resource inventory of combined zinc, lead
and silver resources.

TNG’s other assets include a 20% free-carried interest
in the Cawse Extended Project, convertible to a 2% net
smelter return, which is located adjacent to the Cawse
Nickel-Cobalt Operation in Western Australia.

TNG is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange
(Ticker: TNG) and also on several European Bourses
including Frankfurt.

Highlights – Year in Review
Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project (NT)

• Updated Resource completed for Mount Peake Project
following successful drilling program – 120Mt or 74%of
total Resource of 160Mt now classified as

Measured Resource status.

• Internal technical review of July 2012 Mount
PeakePre-Feasibility Study identifies a significant
under-estimation of the value of iron
oxidemineralisation. A corresponding revision to the
financial model lead to:

- 15% increase in life-of-mine (LOM) revenues
fromA$11.8 billion to A$13.6 billion;

- 40% increase in Net Present Value (NPV8%)
fromA$1.884 billion to A$2.646 billion; and

- 22% increase in pre-tax IRR from 31.8% to 38.7%.
