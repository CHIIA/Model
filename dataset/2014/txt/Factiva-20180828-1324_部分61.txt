Marubeni Corporation and Marubeni Australia Ltd participates in Northwest Rapit Transit consortium,
which was selected by the New South Wales Government in Australia as the Preferred Operator for the
North West Rail Link project.

The NWRL operations contract is a Public Private Partnership to be awarded later in 2014 which
includes the design, construction and financing of the 36km first stage of Sydney’s new rapid transit rail
network.

It also includes the construction of 23 km of new railway track as well as upgrades for an existing section
of the rail network in North West Sydney.
The AU$8.3 billion North West Rail Link is the biggest public transport project currently under
construction in Australia and also Australia’s first fully automated railway system.
To build, operate and maintain this new train network, NRT will form a new company with equity
investment by Marubeni, Hong Kong’s MTR Corporation, Leighton Contractors, Plenary Group, Palisade
Investment Partners in Australia and Partners Group based in Switzerland.

NRT and the NSW Government will work together to achieve contractural execution including financial
close later this year, with services expected to start on the North West Rail Link before the end of 2019.
In 2011, Marubeni participated in the Light Rail PPP Project in Gold Coast City, Australia, as the largest
equity investor, and has been focusing on PPP rail transport business as a strategically important field.
The construction of the Light Rail PPP Project in Gold Coast City was initiated in June 2011 and the
commercial service will commence this month. Marubeni desires to continuously contribute the expansion
of public transport and infrastructure in Australia.
