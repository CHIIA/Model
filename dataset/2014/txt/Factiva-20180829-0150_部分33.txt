The final apartments of the $700m Southport Central development have now been sold. According to
Colliers, 70 of the final 92 apartments were sold to buyers of Asian origin, many of whom already resided
in the Gold Coast area.
In a press release, Mark Worth, Director of Residential Project Marketing at Colliers International, stated
that “Chinese investors, who make up the largest percentage of buyers, are securing a home for their
children that are studying in the area. They tend to look for Chinese populated communities, and after the
students graduate the parents intend to hold the property as an investment or sell it in a much improved
market in the future.”

“Many of the Chinese buyers have also purchased an apartment as a permanent residence, as the
remaining stock still had FIRB (Foreign Investment Review Board) status.”

The Southport area has a relatively high proportion of residents of Asian descent when compared to
nearby areas such as Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach.
Developed by the Raptis Group, the three-tower Southport Central development includes 788
apartments, as well as a street-level retail precinct and 11 floors of office and commercial spaces.
