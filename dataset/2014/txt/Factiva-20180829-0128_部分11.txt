SHARES in the Papua New Guinea-focused oil and gas explorer, Oil Search, were yesterday placed
in a trading halt as the group said it was expecting to announce a material acquisition, possibly a
stake in a new project.
Oil Search, a partner to energy giant Exxon Mobil in a $US19 billion liquefied natural gas venture in
PNG, said last year it was in talks to invest in a separate project in Australia’s northern neighbour set
to be developed by France’s Total SA and PNG’s InterOil.

The group was also scheduled to report its full-year results yesterday but deferred the release until
the announcement. Its shares last traded at $8.57.

The news came as the sharemarket’s run of seven straight days of gains came to an end with a
weaker iron ore price weighing on the resources sector.

The market opened solidly and hit its highest intraday mark since mid-2008 before investors became
nervous and the bears moved in, IG chief market strategist Chris Weston said.
“We’ve got reporting season out of the way and a lot of good news was priced into stocks, and China
has been under a bit of pressure and the iron ore price has come off,’’ Mr Weston said.

The benchmark ASX 200 index closed down 6.4 points, or 0.12 per cent, at 5433.8 while the broader
All Ordinaries index closed down 6.1 points, or 0.11 per cent, at 5444.
Among miners exposed to the iron ore price, BHP Billiton dropped 0.7 per cent to $39.10, Rio Tinto
shed 1.3 per cent to $68.62 and Fortescue Metals lost 2.5 per cent to $5.84.

GrainCorp shares dropped 0.5 per cent to $7.77 after the agribusiness said it expected a fall in
full-year profit.

QBE was one of the better performers, despite posting a full-year loss. The result was not worse than
the company had forecast.WITH BLOOMBERG
