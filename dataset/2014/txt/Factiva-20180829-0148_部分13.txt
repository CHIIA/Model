Cash splash as $150m changes hands in hotel sales

Melbourne's Park Hyatt hotel.
More than $150million in cash has changed hands in Melbourne hotels and industrial property sales in
the past 24 hours, which experts said was an indication of a busy year ahead. In the largest deal, the
private Chinese investor Fu Wah International Group has made its first significant foray into local
property with the purchase of Melbourne's landmark Park Hyatt hotel. It was believed the price paid
was about $135million, but the agents and buyer declined to comment. The five-star hotel is near
Melbourne's Parliament House, at
1St Andrews Place, and was developed in 1999 by Lustig & Moar at a cost of $150million. The sale
involves both the 240-room Park Hyatt and a commercial car park next door. Wayne Bunz, senior
director of CBRE Hotels Australia, and Anton Eilers, executive director of CBRE China, brokered the
off-market transaction between Singapore's GIC and Fu Wah International Group. The agents said the
transaction continued the wave of recent Chinese investment in Australian property, with much of the
recent activity centred on investment and development in Melbourne. Investment in Australian hotels is
tipped

to breach the $2billion level in the next few months as buyers get a foothold before the next growth
phase. In Sydney, the planned Crown Hotel in Barangaroo and the recent sale of the Four Seasons
Hotel has triggered another round
of interest by Australian and overseas investors. Established in 1988, Hong Kong's Fu Wah is engaged
in real estate development, hospitality, and art and culture services. The group's existing property
portfolio includes the Regent Beijing hotel, the Park Plaza Wangfujing hotel and the Sandalwood Beijing
Marriott Executive Apartment, among others. In a statement, Fu Wah's president, Chiu Yung, said: "Fu
Wah is pleased to make this investment into one of the landmark hotel properties in Melbourne. "The
acquisition adds to our ongoing investment into premier hotel and service apartment properties in
China and the wider region."

Mr Bunz said Melbourne was considered a priority destination for foreign capital into Australia. He said
the city recorded the strongest revenue per available room growth of any of the Australian CBD markets
in 2013. In the industrial sector, a Bunnings Warehouse at Torquay has sold to a private investor for
$11.2million. Agents said the sale price translated to a yield of 6.52per cent, and this was the strongest
result achieved for a Bunnings Warehouse since 2007. The transaction follows the recent sale of
Bunnings Mentone for $42.95million, which represented a yield of 6.75per cent.
