Lower-than-forecast premiums have reined in Australia’s biggest insurer, Insurance Australia Group ,
with the group dropping 3 per cent on a trading update.
The company, which has brands including SGIO and CGU, advised investors yesterday that gross
written premiums for the 2013-14 year were expected to increase just 3 per cent to 5 per cent, down
from an earlier forecast of 5 per cent to 7 per cent.

However, with the group benefiting from reduced claims for natural disasters in Australia, including
floods and bushfires, its forecast insurance margins have been upgraded by as much as two
percentage points.

Nonetheless, IAG shares recorded their biggest loss in more than a month, down 17¢ to $5.60 .

Resources stocks were generally lower, with big guns BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto shedding 59¢ to
$37.04 and 62¢ to $64.67 , respectively, on the back of yesterday’s soft manufacturing data out of
China.
Gold stocks also lost ground under the combined impact of a lower bullion price and quarterly
production results.

St Barbara was among the biggest losers, surrendering nearly 10 per cent, or 3.5¢, to 32¢ on news
of reduced gold production and higher costs during the December quarter.
Resolute Mining and Evolution Mining were also off sharply, each down 5¢ to 55.5¢ and 59.5¢
respectively.
Newcrest Mining almost defied the trend with a surprisingly strong quarterly report, but still finished
21¢ lower at $9.13 after profit-takers cashed in on the stock’s recent run.

Elsewhere, gaming group Echo Entertainment lost 4¢ to $2.41 after speculation about a possible
sale of its Townsville casino. Also, accommodation supplier Decmil was in the spotlight, courtesy of
a trading spike. Its volume of 5.6 million shares included a block trade of 3 per cent at $2.005 a
share. It ended at $1.96 .
