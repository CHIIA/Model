Spotless Group has resurrected the all-but-forgotten "greenshoe option" for its May initial public
offering, in an effort to win over offshore investors and ensure a smooth second coming to the
ASX boards.
Should there be ample demand at the cleaning and catering company's May 20-21 book-build, lead
managers Citi, Deutsche Bank and UBS will effectively short Spotless and allocate up to an additional
81.1 million shares to new investors.

The banks will have 30 days to buy back Spotless shares on the market – therefore helping to prop
up the share price if it needs the support – or take the additional shares off the vendor Pacific Equity
Partners.

It's a common practice in large IPOs offshore, but will be the first time it has been used in Australia
since QR National listed in November 2010.
The greenshoe means Spotless and its brokers will be in the market for up to $1.15 billion at the
IPO, to list with a market capitalisation of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.

Spotless chief executive officer Bruce Dixon, numbers man Danny Agnoletto and general manager
Paul Waterson will be leading marketing over the coming three weeks. The trio are in Sydney and
Melbourne for much of the next 10 days before taking on the well-travelled roadshow route –
Singapore, Hong Kong, London and New York.

Fund managers are already focused on price. Spotless is seeking to raise 7.9 times to 8.5 times
forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which is a large premium to the
4.5 times Spotless used to trade before private equity firmPacific Equity Partners made a takeover
bid in November 2011.
Spotless has been repackaged as a much larger, better run company. By June 30, 2015, its
EBITDA margin is expected to be 11.2 per cent, which is almost double where it was before
the takeover.

It is also being pitched at offshore investors, although some are starting to question whether Spotless
can grow earnings at the same pace as offshore rivals ISS and Aramark, which have enjoyed
successful IPOs of their own in the past six months.
