Sydney - Wednesday - December 17 (RWE) - Orbite Aluminae Inc [TSX:ORT] announced today that the
Government of Quebec confirmed the company will receive, on or about December 29, $4 million as the
third installment of its 2012 and 2013 Quebec Investment Tax Credits.
The funds were due to the company in relation to equipment purchased for manufacturing and

As announced on July 22 and October 6, 2014 upon receipt of the first two installments totalling $12.3

Following payment of this third installment, the company will have a balance of $12.6 million in Quebec
Investment Tax Credits receivable, of which $5.4 million relates to the 2012 financial year, $4 million to
the 2013 financial year, and $3.2 million for the first 9 months of 2014.
The company anticipates accruing approximately $1 million during the remainder of 2014, such that total
Quebec Investment Tax Credits under this program as at December 31, 2014 should reach
approximately $30 million.
