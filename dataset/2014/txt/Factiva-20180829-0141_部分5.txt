OUR MARKET CLOSES JUST IN THE NEGATIVE ON MISERABLE VOLUME
With many of our neighbors closed on holiday today turnover on our market was a miserable $2.8 billion
and not much can be read into that.

The $A is at 87.54US c, barely changed from early levels.
*China's official Services PMI announced this afternoon was also weaker, although at 53.4 in January
down from 54.6 in December, another pointer to the slowdown in Australia's major trading partner.

*JB Hi Fi is up 55c to $18.55 on 1.33m shares after its interim report (exactly in line with the January 18
pre-announcement).

*EPW closed down 4c to $2.53 on 300,000 shares after its interim result, and the possibility of a
substantial capital raising, if it decides to bid for NSW's Macquarie Generation.

*Treasury Wines fell another 13c to $3.51 on 10.1m shares.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was down 160 points to 14,690 points, Shanghai CSI physical was
closed on holiday, Hang Seng futures was closed on holiday. S&P futures closed up 3.7 pointst o
1780.40. Nasdaq futures rose 6.3 points to 3520.25. Dow futures gained 33 points to 15,663 points. Gold
