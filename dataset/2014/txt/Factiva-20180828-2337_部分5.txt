Bega Cheese declared that it has been awarded a contract for the delivery of UHT milk to Chinese retail
group Chongqing General Trading Group. The company estimates that the deal would generate up to
A$100 million (US$88.7m) in revenues over five years. The company is very pleased to form this
partnership with CGTG and it is a strong endorsement of the reputation of the quality of Bega product and
the bio security of Australia as a dairy producing nation. We see this as a first step in developing a
comprehensive UHT offering in the future, said Bega CEO Aidan Coleman. Both the Australian and New
Zealand firms intend to boost their presence in China amid growing consumption of dairy products. Since
2000, the Bega brand has been sold in China and Bega Cheese has exported milk powder, infant
formula and cream cheese to the market.
