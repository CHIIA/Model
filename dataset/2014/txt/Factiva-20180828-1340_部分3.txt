HIATUS IN MARKET AS COMPANIES ENTER BLACKOUT PERIOD

Our market saw very little interest today, swung between a high of 5536 and a low of 5493.9 during the
day, on low volume, with a sagging dollar A and lower bond buying perhaps also signifying a lack of
overseas interest. Companies entering their blackout period before the August reporting season and
confession season mostly at an end. There was also little in the way of global news to inspire.

"If we break 5540, 5550 is next. Resistance is at 5520. Up 20 points today"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "Touching on the German index, there was a good relief
rally last night with the index closing not far off its high. There is significant resistance for the DAX at 9783.
Major resistance on the DAX is at 9800, we need to see it break and close above 9800 for the week.
"The Chinese market had quite a strong day yesterday, closing on its highs. The picture looks better,
however 2070 is a big test. If it breaks 2070 it will be a good short term bullish break out. We are likely to
see 2130 tested if we get that break.

Page7of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Gold last week was looking pretty bullish. $1340 has now proven to be its short term top. It broke back
under the 20 day moving average. There is good support around $1300. Gold is in no man's land at the
moment. If $1300 breaks a short term downtrend will form, we are likely to see $1280 tested pretty quickly.
"Copper has had quite a good rally. It has had a break through the $3.15/3.20 per lb level and has been
consolidating between $3.24/3.27 a pound. Volatility has settled down as well. Copper will probably
struggle to push higher than $3.27/lb in the interim. Support will be at $3.36 a pound. There is a bit of profit
taking at the moment, but the formation is positive for copper.

"The S&P500 saw good solid moves last night, coming right back to not far from its 1980 level, only 5
points from previous highs and resistance. The S&P500 has resumed its long term uptrend. However
volume is still on the low side for the US, the market has rallied on small volume.

For the remainder of the week we will probably see the S&P test the 1985 resistance and previous high.

To the XJO - we had a very strong day again yesterday. However we should be wary of rising indexes on
small volume, that given the volatility we saw last week can easily get whacked.

We broke and closed above the 5500 level. The next test will be 5540. The short term uptrend has
resumed. If we break 5540 then the 5550 level is next. Resistance is initially at 5520 followed by the 5540
level.

"For the day I will call it up 20 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 24.6 points to 5511.4 last evening.

RBA Minutes:

Considerations for Monetary Policy

Overall, global economic conditions were little changed over the past month and were consistent with
growth in Australia's major trading partners remaining close to the average of the past decade. Commodity
prices had also been steady, but were well below levels seen earlier this year, the more so in Australian
dollar terms given the appreciation of the exchange rate since then. Financial conditions globally remained
very accommodative.

Page8of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In Australia, GDP growth was above trend in the March quarter and over the past year, reflecting very
strong growth in resource exports from new capacity coming on line. Resource exports were expected to
continue to expand in coming quarters, but not at such a rapid pace. There had been a gradual
improvement in the pace of activity in the non-resource sector and forward-looking indicators suggested
that further strong growth in residential construction was in prospect, despite some easing of conditions in
the established housing market over recent months. After picking up through last year, household
consumption growth appeared to have eased, while non-mining business investment was picking up
gradually.

Conditions in the labour market had improved a little since earlier in the year, although forward-looking
indicators had been mixed of late and consistent with only moderate growth in employment. The national
accounts data confirmed that wage growth had been relatively low, which was consistent with the spare
capacity in the labour market.
At its recent meetings, the Board judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. Low
interest rates were working to support demand, but members agreed that it was difficult to judge the extent
to which this would offset the anticipated substantial decline in mining investment and the effect of
planned fiscal consolidation. The exchange rate remained high by historical standards, particularly given
the declines in key commodity prices, and was therefore offering less assistance than it otherwise might in
achieving balanced growth in the economy.

With growth in resource exports expected to ease back, GDP growth was forecast to be a little below trend
over the next year or so, before picking up gradually thereafter. Inflation was expected to remain within the
target. Accordingly, with the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to support economic
activity, the Board judged that, on present indications, the most prudent course was likely to be a period of
stability in interest rates.

The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

*OZL: Prod at lower end of guidance, cash costs down, cash in hand down
OZ Minerals Ltd for the three months ended June 30 announced total copper produced was 22,181
tonnes forthe June quarter and 40,363 tonnes to date. Total gold produced is 30,736 ozs, 64,528 ozs year
to date.

C1 cash costs are 109.7US c/lb vs 115.2Usc/lb for the year to date was 115.2US c per lb.
As foreshadowed in June the cash balance was lower at June 30 with $155 million due to accelerated
mining in the Malu Open Pit and value held as working capital.
An updated Mineral Resource and Initial Ore Reserve estimates were released for Malu underground on
June 30.

Page10of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Carrapateena pre-feasibility study internal management review is close to completion.

An initial mineral resource estimated was announced for Khamsin on May 26.
There are significant copper and gold mineralisation intersected in first drill results from Bellas Gate
exploration project in Jamaica, including 260m at 0.44% Cu, 0.19gpt Au from 39m.

Guidance:
Production: With year to date copper production over 40,000 tonnes of Cu and the performance in the
Malu Open Pit which has accelerated access to increased quantities of higher grade ore, copper
production for the 2014 full year is predicted to be 85,000 tonnes to 90,000 tonnes of copper, higher than
the annual production guidance previously announced at 75,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes of copper.
C1 unit costs: As a result of a higher proportion of copper ore and lower proportion of gold only ore
expected in the mill feed fort he remainder of the year, while production guidance of 130,000/140,000 ozs
is maintained, it may be to the lower end of the range.
C1 unit costs are expected to reduce to $US1.10/1.20 per lb, reflecting higher copper production and
lower open pit mining unit costs offset to some extent by lower gold by-product credits and higher ore
milled than previously assumed.

and 75,758 ozs silver, all-in sustaining costs of $US2.46/lb. Gold production at Phu Kham is expected to
rise to over 85,000 ozs in 2015 on higher grades.
At the KTL satellite pit, a revised life of mine schedule has KTL feeding ore to the Phu Kham concentrator
from late 2015, allowing annual copper production to rise to over 90,000 tonnes in 2016.
Ban Houayxai produced 24,734 ozs of gold at a C1 cash cost of $US699/oz after credit from 190,600 ozs
silver. All-in sustaining costs were $US998/oz.
Group consolidated copper and gold production for 2014 is expected to be at the upper end of guidance.

On the corporate front, the Frieda River Cu-Au project in PNG continued to advance PanAust's feasibility
study work program .The acquisition of an 80% interest in the project is subject to a condition precedent.

PanAust in an announcement to ASX on May 13 confirmed it had received a confidential, non binding,
indicative and incomplete proposal from the company's largest shareholder, Guangdong Rising Assets
Management (GRAM) to acquire all of the shares in the company by way of an off market takeover. The

*CRB/AAX: Awards Mt Morgan Scoping Study tender to Ausenco

Carbine Resources Ltd announced it has awarded the Mount Morgan Scoping Study tender to Ausenco.
The Study seeks to confirm the technical and economic viability of restarting tailings reprocessing at the
historic Mount Morgan mine to recover remaining gold, copper and pyrite resources.
*Peter Strachan in "StockAnalysis' dated June 4 looked at Cott Oil & Gas, that has announced the results
of a concept study on development of a 1 Mt p.a. FLNG project around its 800 Bcf Pandora gas project in
the Gulf of Papua.
Talisman Energy is the operator at Pandora with a 25% interest and also has an interest in the PNG
Foreland project. Other partners include Kina with 25%, Santos with 10% while Cott holds 40%. Peter says
in the report, "The field consists of a 290m thick Miocene aged reef structure that was discovered in 1988
and tested gas at a healthy flow rate of 57 mmscfd. The top of the gas column at Pandora A was
encountered at 1,392 m total vertical depth and the project is considered to have upside potential for about
1.5Tcf of gas.

Peter sees the production cost estimate of between $US6.55/8.10 per mmBtu for gas delivered to a
customer in Asia as very competitive, so is the Build Own and Operate quotes for an FLNG facility for a toll
processing fee of $4/Mcf - and StockAnalysis sees interesting possibilities to tie the Pandora project in with
HZN/ROC's Osaka Gas and Talisman's Stanley, Elevala-Tingu and Ketu gas projects onshore in the PNG
forelands' Peter says in the report.
