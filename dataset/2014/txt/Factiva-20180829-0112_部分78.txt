Horizon Oil looks set to benefit from the progress it has made in commercialising its gas resources in
Papua New Guinea, having secured key government approvals for its $US300 million
($319.3 million) Stanley gas condensates project in the Western Province.

While the approval from the PNG government was not unexpected, Ord Minnett analyst John Young
said it augured well for Horizon's efforts to develop its other, bigger gas and liquids fields nearby.

Horizon shares gained as much as 6.1 per cent on Monday on the news, after returning from a trading
halt. But the stock closed just marginally higher at 33.5¢ and it remains well off its 12-month high of
44¢ reached last May.

Mr Young, who has a 53¢ price target for Horizon shares, pointed to some selling of stock by
investors last year that switched their exposure to lower-risk convertible notes in Horizon. That selling
has weighed on the share price.

UBS also has a positive call on Horizon shares, although with a more modest 12-month price target of
40¢.
The company's other main assets are a stake in the producing Maari field in New Zealand and in the
Beibu Gulf oil project in China. The granting of a petroleum development licence for the Stanley
project will trigger payments of $US97 million from Japanese utility Osaka Gas, which is buying into
the venture. As Horizon has already received a $US20.4 million deposit, an additional payment of
$US77 million will fall due within weeks.

UBS analyst Nik Burns noted clarity is still required about the timeline and budget for Stanley, in which
Canada's Talisman Energy also has a stake.
He estimates the cost at $US315 million and assumes production of condensates will start in
mid-2016.

UBS values the Stanley project at 3¢ per share for Horizon, while Ord Minnett puts it at about 2¢ per
share.
