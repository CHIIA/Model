Global oil and gas services companyASCO Group has added another string to its bow with the
$28 million purchase of a majority stake in logistics provider Bonnie Rock Transport.

ASCO has acquired an initial 60 per cent holding in BRT, with the option of taking that to 100 per
cent in the next two to three years.

BRT provides freight distribution, warehousing and distribution, with a particular focus on servicing
the oil and gas industry.
The company has depots in Forrestfield, Dampier, Dongara and Broome, as well as the
Queensland town of Chinchilla.
Its customers include BHP Billiton, Apache Energy, ExxonMobil and Buru Energy,
ASCO Australasia chief executive Matt Thomas said the purchase underlined the UK-based
company's growth plans in Australia.

"Bonnie Rock Transport is a perfect fit with ASCO Group's international activities and our expansion
plans in Australia," he said.

"ASCO Australasia can now support its customers through the entire supply chain cycle, ensuring
equipment and materials get to where they are needed, when they are needed."

BRT managing director Jim Currie said he looked forward to working closely with ASCO to grow the
business.
Mr Currie founded the company in 1998 along with other members of his family, who will retain
their current senior managerial positions.

ASCO had previously engaged contractors to carry out the transport logistics work that BRT will
provide.

BRT will initially retain its name but is expected to eventually transition to the ASCO brand.
ASCO said no jobs would be lost from BRT's 150-strong workforce as a result of the purchase.
