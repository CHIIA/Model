2347 GMT [Dow Jones] Investors should prefer Auckland International Airport (AIA.NZ) over Sydney
Airport (SYD.AU), says Macquarie, given it is trading at a discount, yet delivering better passenger
growth. The broker says Sydney Airport needs a pickup in international passengers passing through its
terminals to get an earnings boost. So far, however, quarterly growth in passenger numbers is below
Macquarie's long-term expectation of 3%-4%, which reflects airlines' discipline in adding new capacity.
"Whilst Sydney Airport's share price has fallen, it is not enough to be undervalued," Macquarie says. The
broker rates Sydney Airport at neutral with a A$4.48/share price target. SYD last traded at A$4.235.

2347 GMT [Dow Jones]--Nymex crude is likely to consolidate near-term after settling down just four cents
Monday at $82.71/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the
five- & 15-day moving averages are declining, the MACD indicator is bearish; but the slow stochastic
measure is bullish at oversold levels. Resistance is at $83.48 (Monday's high); a breach would be
near-term positive, exposing the upside to the 10-day exponential moving average (now at $84.25), then
to $84.45 (Friday's high), $84.83 (Thursday's high), $85.60 (Oct. 14 high) and $85.87 (Oct. 13 high). But
a drop below $81.55 (Monday's low) would tilt the near-term view negative, exposing the downside to
$79.78 (Thursday's more-than-two-year low), then to $77.28 (June 28, 2012 swing low) and $74.95 (Oct.
4, 2011 swing low). November crude (expiring today) is up four cents at $82.75/bbl, while the more
actively traded December crude is down three cents at $81.88 on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2344 GMT [Dow Jones] Ferrovial SA's (FER.MC) 1.95 Australian dollar/share ($1.70) bid for Transfield
Services Ltd. (TSE.AU) looks fairly full and investors may well want to sell into current share-price
strength, says CIMB, which upgrades the stock to a hold recommendation. "While we expect there to be
an informal floor under the share price, which supports our A$1.85 target price, we would not be enticed
by the prospect of an increased bid emerging and believe shareholders should capitalize on the current
elevated price rather than rely on a prospective increased offer," the broker says. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

11:32 GMT [Dow Jones] Despite the recent sharp fall in the share prices of Australia's banks they have
still outperformed the wider market, leaving Citi preferring to stay on the sidelines for now and only
planning to get more involved at lower prices. It expects a good set of full-year earnings reports from the
major lenders, although it ponders whether other banks will follow NAB's (NAB.AU) lead and accelerate
the amortization of capitalized software. There remains significant regulatory uncertainty for the banking
sector, Citi adds. It has neutral recommendations on ANZ Banking (ANZ.AU) and Westpac (WBC.AU),
and a sell on NAB. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

2334 GMT [Dow Jones]--Over the past decade, Australia's National Electricity Market hasn't been a
happy hunting ground for owners of merchant generation, and there's little sign of a letup, with excess
supply continuing to weigh on prices, says J.P. Morgan. The broker estimates that generators have
amassed economic losses of more than A$10 billion over the past decade, as average prices failed to
cover capital costs for extended periods. "Absent an improvement in demand, or a significant supply-side
response, our analysis suggests that generation returns will remain depressed for the foreseeable
future," J.P. Morgan says. The broker prefers Origin (ORG.AU) to AGL Energy (AGK.AU) because of
Origin's bigger exposure to the retail market. "While Tier 2 retailers continue to be a competitive threat to
the Big 3, elevated reserve margins--and resultant benign wholesale prices--will provide greater benefit to
gentailers that are 'long retail'/'short generation'. In our view, AGK's recent acquisition of MacGen has

Page85of333©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.tipped the balance in favour of ORG, which remains the only Big 3 gentailer with length to retail."

2332 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS cut WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR.AU) to sell from neutral on worries that major
oil customers will start to scale back spending for reasons that include a greater focus on shareholder
returns, a recent sharp fall in oil prices, and increasing geopolitical tensions globally. UBS inks in a new
FY15 net profit of around 280 million Australian dollars ($244.8 million), putting it around 5% below
consensus, while a forecast FY16 net profit of A$312 million is 14% below what other analysts are
expecting. WorleyParsons is trading on a multiple of around 13 times forward earnings, a premium to its
peers. "We expect earnings risk and relatively low earnings visibility to remain a key issue for
WorleyParsons over the medium term, in which we believe predicting the timing of major project start-ups
and completions will remain challenging for management," UBS says. The broker also cuts its price
target by 24.6% to A$13.00/share ($11.36). WOR last traded at A$13.83. (david.winning@wsj.com;

11:29 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/GBP is likely to consolidate with a bearish bias Tuesday after hitting a
four-day low 0.7900 on Monday. Daily chart is mixed as MACD indicator bullish, but slow stochastic
measure is falling from overbought levels. Support is at 0.7900-0.7897 (Monday's low-Oct. 14 low); a
breach would expose the downside to 0.7846 (Oct. 13 low), then to 0.7832 (Oct. 7 low). Resistance is at
0.7930 (Monday's high); a breach would tilt the near-term view positive, targeting 0.7981 (Friday's high),
then 0.8027 (Thursday's high). Spot EUR/GBP is at 0.7917. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2325 GMT [Dow Jones]--Regional refiner maintenance activity is cutting fuel supplies and helping to
boost refiner margins at Caltex Australia (CTX.AU), prompting Deutsche Bank to up its calendar 2014
earnings per share forecast on the company by 6.1%. Keeping a hold recommendation, the broker also
nudges up its price target to A$25.45/share from A$25.35. CTX was last at A$28.71, having jumped 43%
so far this year. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

2323 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Bank lifts its call on Sonic Healthcare Ltd. (SHL.AU) to buy from hold
and nudges its target to 20.50 Australian dollars/share ($17.92) from A$20 after the company
establishes a Canadian beachhead with a 15-year contract to provide lab services in Alberta. The
brokerage says the win establishes a presence in a potentially attractive new market and should further
boost SHL's power with suppliers. "While the capex requirements are not yet known, we have little doubt
the deal will boost returns." SHL is trading up 0.2% at A$17.75. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2322 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/CAD is likely to consolidate with a buoyant tone before 0200 GMT China
3Q GDP. Pair is supported by loonie sales on cross trades versus major currencies. But USD/CAD gains
are tempered by positive risk appetite; weaker dollar sentiment; caution before Bank of Canada's interest
rate decision Wednesday. The BOC is expected to keep its overnight target rate at 1.0% where it has
been stuck for more than four years. Daily chart is positive-biased as MACD indicator is bullish; five- &
15-day moving averages advancing. Resistance is at 1.1293 (Monday's high); a breach would expose
upside to 1.1360 (Thursday's high). Support is at 1.1247 (Monday's low); a breach would temper the
positive near-term view, targeting 1.1212 (Friday's low), then 1.1193 (Oct. 14 low). Spot USD/CAD is at
1.1286. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
2315 GMT [Dow Jones]--USD/CHF is likely to consolidate with a bearish bias before 0200 GMT China
3Q GDP data. Pair is undermined by weaker dollar sentiment; franc demand on buoyant CHF/JPY cross.
Daily chart is mixed as MACD indicator bearish, five-day moving average is below 15-day MA and
declining; but slow stochastic measure is bullish near oversold levels. Support is at 0.9412 (Monday's
low), then at 0.9405-0.9396 band (Friday's low-Thursday's low); a breach would expose the downside to
0.9358-0.9351 band (Wednesday's low-Sept. 23 low). Resistance is at 0.9481-0.9491 band (Monday's
high-Thursday's high); a breach would temper the negative near-term view, exposing the upside to
0.9562-0.9572 band (Wednesday's high-Oct. 13 high). Spot USD/CHF is at 0.9430. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
2315 GMT [Dow Jones] GBP/USD is likely to consolidate with a bullish bias before 0200 GMT China 3Q
GDP. Pair is supported by weaker dollar sentiment; sterling demand on buoyant GBP/JPY cross amid
positive risk sentiment. Daily chart is positive-biased as MACD & stochastic indicators are bullish, while
the five-day moving average is rising above the 15-day MA. Resistance is at 1.6179 (Monday's high); a
breach would target 1.6226 (Oct. 9 high), then 1.6251 (Oct. 1 high) and 1.6287 (Sept. 30 high). Support
is at 1.6077 (Monday's low); a breach would expose the downside to 1.6027 (Friday's low). Spot
GBP/USD is at 1.6156. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
