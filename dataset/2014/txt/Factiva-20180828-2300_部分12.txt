CHINA has moved to develop new milk sources in Australia in the wake of a free-trade deal between
the two countries.
Australia’s Freedom Foods Group has signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s New
Hope Group to develop a long-term supply of milk, with the establishment of new large-scale farms
in southeast Australia.

The farms will be managed by Perich Group, which holds a stake of about 60 per cent in Freedom
Foods.
New Hope will be a core investor and partner, while continuing to market and distribute dairy
products into China through New Hope Dairy.
New Hope, one of the largest suppliers of meat, eggs and dairy products in China, has $500 million
to be used in the development of agricultural and food processing in Australia, with a large portion to
be invested in dairy. “Australia has a unique advantage in the supply and manufacture of high-quality
premium agriculture-based foods,” Freedom Foods managing director Rory Macleod said.
