The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close mildly higher today.

Europe and the UK closed lower. The US markets were slightly lower.

On the NYSE where 3240 issues traded there were 1,193 issues higher, 1,927 down and 120 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2721 issues traded there were 1,010 issues higher, 1,596 down and 115 unchanged.
Metals were mixed, crude was barely changed, gold was up a touch. The $A is at 92.60US c, down about
10 points from last evening.

"5475/79 is a key level to hold. Resistance around 5500. I will call us up 10"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "Overnight markets were pretty uneventful with not
much of a range in the US.

"The S&P500 closed not far from its high which is always a good sign although it did test 1920, it closed at
1924.24, still hovering around record highs. Resistance is at 1925 support is at around 1098.
Gold has seen a savage sell off last week and early this week, obviously a bearish breakdown. There
should be good support around $1240 per oz, and I expect a short term bounce from current levels, but it
is likely to be a dead cat bounce. Gold may rally back up to around $1260 but I would expect it will then
resume its downtrend. Resistance is at $1260, support at $1240. If we see a break of $1240 we would be
set to test the $1200 lows.

"I have been watching the Euro/$US that has been in a bit of a down trend since the ECB began talking
about quantitative easing and a rate cut, consolidating around $1.36/1 Euro. The ECB meets tonight.
While everyone is positioned on the short side, factoring in QE from the ECB tonight, I wouldn't be
surprised if we saw a bounce back to $1.37/1Euro.

"US 10 year bond yields have had a bit of a rally over the last 10 days from 2.4% to 2.6% last night after
having been in a downtrend pretty much from the highs of December last year. It has broken above the 3
day moving average. While still in downtrend, if it breaks 2.6% and continue to push higher it would bode
well for some insurers like QBE.

"The Shanghai market is still trading in the 2030/2040 range and is still looking more likely to have a rally
than a sell off in June at the moment.

"The XJO closed on its lows yesterday and is sitting right on the 20 day moving average and could go
either way. I expect we may find support at 5479, the 20 day moving average level. Any breakdown from
current levels could see us for the first time for 2/3 weeks break back below the moving average.

5475/79 is a key level to hold for the today and the week. Resistance is around 5500 for today.

"After our fairly aggressive sell off yesterday I will call us up 10 points'.

*PRT: Exits shareholding in Freeview, explains reasons
Prime Media group advised in response to media reports about its decision to exit Freeview said it made
the decision because it believes that HbbTV television set penetration into its regional markets will be less
than 1% in the first quarter of 2015. Furthermore there is no data to confirm when or if those HbbTV
capable televisons will actually be connected to broadband services.

PRIME has decided that its bet course of action is to wait and see, particularly as it does not believe
regional television markets are sufficiently developed to support HbbTV commercially.

Page5of266©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.PRIME has paid all invoices issued by Freeview except in respect of invoices pertaining to an
extraordinary budget item specifically related to the HbbTV project. There is however no question about
PRIME's capacity to pay. (Jun 3)

*WDC/WRT: Ind committee advises acceptance of Scentre deal the better option

Westfield Retail Trust has released its Second Supplementary Securityholder Booklet in relation to the
proposal to merge with Westfield Group's Australian and New Zealand business to form a new entity,
Scentre Group, with the meeting now scheduled for June 20.t.
Westfield Group's indication that if the Revised Proposal does not proceed WDC would pursue the
separation of its Australian and New Zealand business without any involvement by Westfield Retail Trust
is material new information.
Chairman of Westfield Retail Trust, Mr Richard Warburton AO, LVO said, "The Independent Board
Committee believes that there is no prospect of an amended or enhanced deal being negotiated with
Westfield Group. Westfield Group has indicated that if the revised proposal is unsuccessful it will pursue
the separation of its Australian and New Zealand business without any involvement by Westfield Retail
Trust.

"This further strengthens our view that the Revised Proposal is in the best interests of Securityholders... if
Westfield Group implements the separation of its businesses without Westfield Retail Trust ... the
implications could be materially adverse to Westfield Retail Trust and Securityholders.
"After careful consideration the Independent Board Committee believes the creation of Scentre Group is
the preferred option to maximise long term value". (Jun 3 7.34 pm)

Metal trade in China may be affected by port of Qingdao fraud, investigation
FastMarkets reported the metal financing business in China, a key aspect of trade over the past few
years, may take a hit from an investigation into the alleged fraudulent use of warehouse receipts in the
port of Qingdao.

Authorities in Qingdao have stopped the shipment of some material while they investigate the alleged
cases of multiple financing, or loans using the same warehouse receipts as collateral. Trades in China
said the seized material is mostly aluminium as well as some copper concentrate, not refined copper or
nickel. Traders told FastMarkets getting finance for metal had already become more difficult, and this will
be exacerbated by the Qingdao news.

customers have strengthening order books - their lead times are the best they've been in many, many
