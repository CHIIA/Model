A major shareholder in ASX-listed explorer Sovereign Gold Co. Ltd. has taken a 17.2% interest in the
company's subsidiary Mount Adrah Gold Ltd., according to a June 30 statement.
Hudson Resources Ltd., which is also listed on the ASX, has bought 10 million shares and 10 million
options for A$2 million. The acquisition values Mount Adrah at about A$11.6 million based on the 58
million shares on issue and the 20 Australian cents per share purchase price.

Hudson owns 40 million Sovereign Gold shares, equating to a 25.5% interest.

Earlier in June, Mount Adrah withdrew its IPO and application to list on the ASX. The IPO aimed to raise
A$2 million, which had been earmarked for further exploration at the Mount Adrah gold project in New
South Wales.
Meanwhile, Sovereign Gold and Precious Metal Resources Ltd. expect to put their planned corporate
restructure to a shareholder vote during the current quarter.
The restructure is aimed at simplifying each company's structure and assets.
Following the restructure, Sovereign Gold will hold a 55% interest in the joint venture with China's
state-owned Jiangsu Geology & Engineering Co., or Sugec, and a 72% interest in Mount Adrah Gold.

The move would reduce Sovereign's shareholding in Precious Metal Resources to 15.53% from 78%.
