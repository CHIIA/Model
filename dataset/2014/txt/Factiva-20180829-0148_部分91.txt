Outlook

Managing director Ross Barker said in the outlook statement the domestic economy is facing a period of
transition with declining levels of investment spending in the resources sector, further fiscal tightening and
low levels of business and consumer confidence likely to produce subdued growth. Although a lower $A
and low interest rates may provide some support, the key to improvement will be meaningful improvement
in productivity and business confidence.

on the lookout for attractive long term investment opportunies but are prepared to be patient at this point".
