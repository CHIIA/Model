SOUTHWEST Victorian dairy farms are the prime real estate sought by newly listed industry
investor Australian Dairy Farms Group.
The group, which yesterday became the only milk producer listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange, wants to add more dairy farms to its two operations at Brucknell in southwest Victoria.

It has raised $9.3 million through selling stapled securities for 20c each, and chairman Michael
Hackett said there would be $3-$3.5 million left after farm and loan repayments on existing
properties.
Mr Hackett said the group had “some fairly good names on register” with investors from Hong Kong,
New Zealand and Australia.
The group aims to control 16 dairy farms but acknowledged this could be a long process and may
include management, leasing or sharefarming business arrangements.
“We have done due diligence on a number of farms over the last 12 months, some have been sold,
others are still available,” Mr Hackett said.“We are fairly selective with what we are looking for. They
have to be in close proximity to our existing farms.”
