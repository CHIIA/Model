APA Group says it will be in a better position to buy Queensland LNG infrastructure after delivering
gas transmission companyEnvestra to Asia’s richest man, meaning it will not directly return to
investors cash raised in a $784 million stake sale.
The Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing yesterday emerged triumphant in the year-long takeover
battle when rival APA sold its 33 per cent stake in Envestra into a $1.35-a-share bid from Mr Li’s
Cheung Kong Infrastructure that valued Envestra at $2.4 billion.

APA chief Mick McCormack said it was disappointing to lose the battle he had started and raised to
$1.17 a share, but the CKI bid offered more value to sell than he saw in owning the company.

Mr McCormack said APA was averaging about $300m to $400m of capital spending a year,
meaning the sale would cover a couple of years of this.
And it would be handy for other acquisition opportunities.
“There’s been speculation the Queensland LNG pipelines will be put up for sale. If one of those
came up, we’d be keen to take a look,” he said.

Both BG Group’s Queensland Curtis LNG project and the Australia Pacific LNG project being built
by Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips have flagged sales of the pipelines they are building to take
onshore coal-seam gas to LNG plants at Gladstone.
APA said that, while there remained a good rationale for it to purchaseEnvestra, selling its stake
was a better outcome for shareholders.

“The cash offer put forward by the consortium well exceeded our valuation of the Envestra
business, even at full ownership,” Mr McCormack said.
The APA chief said cheap capital was flooding the world, something he said could be a lead-up to
another financial crisis.

This meant buyers like CKI could bid more for regulated assets with certain returns.
APA will book $430m of the sale price as profit, meaning that it faces about $129m of tax
payments.

APA shares ended 1c lower at $7.38.

APA’s decision to sell means CKI now has more than 50 per cent of Envestra, giving it control of
the company and making its offer unconditional.

APA said it had received $21m as part of Envestra’s final dividend payout on July 25.

the endorsement from then 17 per cent shareholder CKI.In May, CKI made its better, and now
successful, offer.
