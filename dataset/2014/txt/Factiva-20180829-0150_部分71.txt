year bond yields were steady at 4.23%.

The $A is at 89.14US c, down 1.20US c from last evening.

*The banks contributed 10.4 positive points to the index (after contributing 28.4 negative points
yesterday), resources contributed 1.2 positive points, property trusts contributed 1.2 positive points,

Our market regained less than half of yesterday's loss, as expected, with the $A back to recent levels
after the inexplicable spike up over the last few days (that triggered a bank sell off), with sobering China
eco news, and World Bank forecasts for China, a dampener for expected growth in Australia's major
trading partner.
CHINESE BANKS NEW LOANS FAR SHORT OF FORECAST
*Chinese banks made 482.5 billion yuan (HK$614 billion) worth of new yuan loans last month, falling far
short of a forecast of 600 billion yuan and the previous month’s 624.6 billion yuan, central bank data
showed on Wednesday.

The broad M2 money supply rose 13.6 per cent last month from a year earlier, the People’s Bank of
China said, missing the forecast in a Reuters poll of a 13.8 per cent rise.

Outstanding yuan loans rose 14.1 per cent from a year earlier versus forecasts for growth of 14.3 per
cent.
The central bank said China’s total social financing aggregate, a broad measure of liquidity in the
economy, was 1.23 trillion yuan last month, unchanged from the month before.
China’s foreign exchange reserves, the world’s largest, hit US$3.82 trillion at the end of the year from
US$3.66 trillion at the end of September.

WORLD BANK UPGRADES FORECAST FOR GLOBAL GROWTH ..

Page215of297©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*The World Bank upgraded its forecast for global growth this year by two tenths to 3.2%.

Growth is then projected to stabilise at 3.4 per cent in 2015 and 3.5 per cent in 2016.

"Growth appears to be strengthening in both high-income and developing countries, but downside risks
continue to threaten the global economic recovery," World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim said in a
statement.

"The performance of advanced economies is gaining momentum, and this should support stronger growth
in developing countries in the months ahead."
.. BUT CHINA'S GDP TO BE FLAT THIS YEAR, SLOW NEXT FEW YEARS
The World Bank said it expected Chinese GDP to stay flat this year at 7.7 per cent before slowing to 7.5
per cent over the next few years, "reflecting deleveraging and less reliance on policy-induced investment".
"The region is vulnerable to risks of disorderly unwinding in Chinese investment and abrupt tightening in
global financing conditions," the World Bank added. "Commodity exporters are also vulnerable to sharper
than expected declines in commodity prices."

"High will be 5257. Low 5220. Close at 5242, up 30 points"

Daniel Goulding, the author of The Sextant Report said, "Our market looks set to open higher with our
local futures contract up 30 points.

"Global equities were given some breathing room overnight with a moderate pull back in the Japanese
yen.

"Over in the US the Semiconductor index hit a new rally high and with the Trannies on the verge of doing
the same, there is a green light for US equities to hit new rally highs.

"Volume yesterday in our market, while higher than what we have witnessed recently, was not that
significant, suggesting it is just a pullback on the way to a new, perhaps final, rally high.

"The high today will be 5257. The low will be 5220. When the dust has settled the market will have closed
at 5242, up 30 points".

The S&P/ASX200 fell 80.1 points to 5212 last evening.

*FSF: Fonterra locates and recalls batches of e-coli contaminated fresh cream The Waikato Times
reported today, "Fonterra's chairman and board are being asked to resign by a Waikato farmer and
Fonterra shareholder Russ Rimmington after the dairy giant's latest food safety scare.

Fonterra yesterday said a batch of fresh cream supplied to Anchor and Pams was contaminated with E
coli and recalled 8700 bottles - of 300ml and 500ml - of the product.

Mr Rimmington was angry that nearly 24 hours after the recall was announced through media Mr Wilson
had not contacted the co-operative's 10,500 farmer shareholders to explain the situation.

Fonterra shareholder and Waikato Federated Farmers provincial president James Houghton was also
frustrated at the lack of communication provided to shareholders.

Mr Houghton said he only learned about the E coli contamination through the emailed news service
provided by The Global Dairy news service yesterday morning.

"It is frustrating, as a farmer, that these things happen."

But Waikato farmer Bruce Rowe was impressed with Fonterra Brands managing director Peter McClure
communicating that it was the first positive test for E coli in nearly 20 years.

"That was clever, but I don't think this is anything like the botulism scare."
Federated Farmers dairy section chairman Willy Leferink said the recall showed that Fonterra's quality
assurance systems worked.
