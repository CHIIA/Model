Dubai - Global law firmK&L Gates LLP has advised Dubai-based developer Emaar Properties PJSC on
the acquisition of an adult dinosaur fossil skeleton, which was put on display at The Dubai Mall, the world's
largest shopping center, earlier this week.

position in the Dana Quarry in Wyoming, USA, in 2008. The specimen was previously displayed at the
Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas before being shipped to the United Arab Emirates.

The K&L Gates team was led by Dubai partner Omar Momany and Chicago partners Richard Sevcik and
