Metals X will resurrect the HBJ mine at its South Kalgoorlie operations this year, chief executive
Peter Cook revealed yesterday as the gold miner locked away a $10 million acquisition in the
Murchison.
In a case of Chinese whispers, Middle Kingdom-backed Norton Gold Fields and Hanking Gold
Mining were yesterday touted as the unnamed party which lodged an 11th hour bid for Reed
Resources’ Meekatharra assets.

The left-field play forced Metals X to lift its cash and scrip offer from $7.7 million to $10 million.

“To try and scuttle a deal at five minutes to midnight like that off the back of our work is scurrilous
and underhanded,” Mr Cook said.
Norton boss Dianmin Chen yesterday denied the company was behind the bid.

Metals X will pay Ferrier Hodgson, as administrator for collapsed Reed subsidiary GMK
Exploration, $9.4 million cash and return 24 million Reed shares worth $600,000.
The acquisition should settle next week, handing Metals X control of 1.8 million ounces of gold
reserves, a 2.5Mtpa Bluebird mill and a 200-person camp as it strives to start production next
year.
Mr Cook said the purchase price remained “astounding value”.

“Our focus is to build a number of underground mines in the region and we still believe we can be
in production next year,” he said.

Mr Cook also revealed work was well advanced on an underground mine at HBJ — short for
Hampton-Boulder-Jubilee, which has been mined on and off as an open pit for the past three
decades.
Dewatering has begun and mining should start later this year, creating up to 100 jobs in a boost
for the Goldfields economy.

“We certainly expect to start this year, and next year will be mainly ramp-up, but we will be
producing from the mine,” Mr Cook said.

Meanwhile, Reed chairman and former Goldfields stockbroker David Reed said selling off the
company’s gold assets would shift the focus onto developing the Mt Marion lithium project, 40km
south-west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder.
The Meekatharra sale will settle around the same time as Reed offloads its Comet Vale gold
project for $2 million to private investors from Perth.

energy storage applications.
Reed Industrial Minerals, a subsidiary 30 per cent-owned by iron ore miner Mineral Resources,
this year commissioned a semi-pilot lithium plant in the US.
Test work should finish in the June quarter and could lead to the design of a processing facility.

“The lithium project is going really well, we think that will probably be the first operation we get
once we have divested ourselves of all our gold projects,” Mr Reed said.

“We are hopeful in the next 12 months we could have an operation there.”
