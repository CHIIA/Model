THE sharemarket has fallen for a second straight day, due to a drop by energy stocks and
weakness in the banking sector.
Australia's biggest oil and gas producer, Woodside Petroleum, experienced a steep share price fall
after its biggest shareholder, global oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, sold almost all of its stake in the
company.

This dragged the energy sector and the wider sharemarket lower.

IG analyst Chris Weston said the falls were accompanied by profit-taking by bank investors, ahead
of a US Federal Reserve policy meeting.

"Ultimately this is a market which is treading water ahead of the FOMC meeting tonight," Mr Weston
said.

"Some of the weakness dragging down the market is in the banks."
Woodside shed $1.95 to $40.90, while Santos dropped 19¢ to $14.31 and Oil Search was 8¢ lower
at $9.69.

Commonwealth Bank dropped 24¢ to $81.00, National Australia Bank shed 13¢ to $33.01, Westpac
lost 30¢ to $33.84 and ANZ was 19¢ weaker at $33.74.
The materials sector remained resilient despite concerns about the Chinese economy, as bargain
hunters took advantage of recent price falls caused by a slump in iron ore prices.

Fortescue Metals gained 8¢ to $4.02, Rio Tinto added 45¢ to $57.90, but BHP Billiton dropped 8¢ to
$35.28.

David Jones gained 2¢ to $3.90 after shareholders in South African retailer Woolworths Holdings
approved its $2.2 billion takeover of the department store chain.
Solomon Lew has also taken a near 10 per cent stake in David Jones, ahead of its shareholder vote
on the takeover.
Mining contractor Mineral Resources dropped 20¢ to $9.35 after its bid to take control of iron ore
explorer Aquila Resources failed.

Aquila shares gained 22¢ to $3.35.

At the close on Wednesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 18 points, or 0.33 per
cent, at 5382.7.

The broader All Ordinaries index was down 16.8 points, or 0.31 per cent, at 5,363.9.
