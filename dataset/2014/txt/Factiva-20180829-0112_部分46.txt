Following meetings with Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. executives, Western Australia Premier Colin
Barnett has suggested that the stalled West Pilbara iron ore project should undergo an ownership
restructure to help resume work at the A$7.4 billion operation, The Australian Financial Review reported
April 11.

Barnett said the project was "certainly springing into life" having met Baosteel Chairman He Wenbo during
a recent trip to China. Baosteel indirectly owns a stake in the project through its 19.8%-owned unit,
Aquila Resources Ltd., which in turn holds a 50% stake in API Management Pty. Ltd., the holding
company of West Pilbara.

API Management's remaining 50% stake is owned equally between POSCO and American Metals & Coal
International Inc., or AMCI, who remain of two minds about developing the iron ore operation.
According to the report, the A$1.4 billion mine development of West Pilbara could be transferred to a
separate vehicle while another set of investors could further the A$6 billion, Anketell Point rail and port
infrastructure project.

It is yet unclear how the split will be facilitated, but, once settled, would reportedly see an influx of
investment from specialist infrastructure operators and investors. To that end, the government intends to
ink a native-title deal with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corp. which would see the natives receive A$20
million over several years.

"That will settle native title on the port site and the industrial site next to it so that's a big step forward,"
Barnett said.
Both POSCO and AMCI Capital are reportedly seeking buyers for their respective stake in the project —
AMCI Capital CEO Harris Antoniou, however, has denied the speculation. "AMCI is committed to the
development of the project and we have no plans to sell our interest," Antoniou said.
In contrast, POSCO, which acquired a stake in West Pilbara for A$200 million at a previous date, is
seeking to restructure itself in a bid to improve its financial structure. According to The West Australian,
Baosteel was nearing agreements to acquire POSCO and AMCI's stake in West Pilbara.
API Management owns a 60% stake in West Pilbara, the remaining 40% of which is held by Red Hill Iron.
API Management's stake would go up by 20% once first commercial shipment of ore is achieved from
West Pilbara.
