OUR MARKET CLOSES AT HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE SEPTEMBER 2008

Our market rose strongly, now at the highest levels since September 2008 (a few points higher than the
5411.4 points close on October 28 2013) on huge volume worth $5.8 billion. The $A is at 89.60US c, up
about 25 points from last evening.

Our market was led by the Big 4 banks - could also be as a proxy for the $A in offshore buying -
contributing 17.7 positive points with insurers contributing 1.7 points while resources contributed 3.1
positive points - cheered by a better than expected GDP number, the apparent easing of tensions in the
Ukraine and China's confirming its growth target at 7.5% remained.
*Uranium stocks were a standout, in Canada and in Australia. While Japan committed to debating
whether to restart its 48 nuclear plants with a decision by end March (and perhaps also build new plants),
news services report the Prime Minister and Cabinet could announce the decision at any time, depending
on support within the Cabinet.

*Paladin rose 6c to 56.5c on 24.4m shares, Berkeley rose 5c to 39c on 527,710 shares, Silex rose 20c to
$2.25 on 313,904.
*The Shanghai CSI physical fell however, perhaps on nervousness after solar equipment producer
Cahori Solar said it will only be able to pay 4 million yuan of the 89 million yuan in interest it has to
meet today - fears are a spate of restructurings and defaults against China's record levels of corporate
debt).
