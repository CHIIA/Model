BOART Longyear has secured the final piece of a $US342 million bailout plan and says recovery in
demand for its drilling services could be more than a year away.
Investors overwhelmingly supported the final $US84 million equity piece of Boart Longyear’s private
equity recapitalisation package at a special meeting yesterday.

“This provides the capability to make it through what will continue to be a challenging market for 2015,
maybe into 2016,” chief executive Richard O’Brien said.
The company may experience a further fall in use of its drilling rigs if gold prices fall significantly, he
said.
Boart Longyear has 60 per cent of its business in gold and copper exploration. A global recovery could
come as late as 2016, amid reduced demand in China, Mr O’Brien said.

He forecast a “gentle upslope” in recovery.
“We don’t need a V-shaped recovery, we just need a recovery,” he said. The company, which has
$500 million in debt, expects to earn $US30 million in calendar 2014, below the $US34
million-$US48 million forecast by analysts.Mr O’Brien said completion of the recapitalisation plan from
Centerbridge Partners would reduce net debt to $US450 million. The company plans to repay $US300
million in 2018, then a $US120 million tranche in 2020 and a $US285 million tranche in 2021.
