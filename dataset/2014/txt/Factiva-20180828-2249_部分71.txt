1159 GMT BG Group is expected to deliver robust production growth next year for the first time in 10
years as output ramps up in Australia and Brazil, says Deutsche Bank in a note. "Several years into the
capital build and 2015 will in our view be the year when things finally start to come together operationally
for BG," Deutsche says. Falling capex and strong underlying growth in operating cash flow should lessen
financial risk. Also, BG's appeal as a merger target is seen supporting the share price at current levels
with upside expected as investors start to see the production coming in, the report adds. Deutsche has a
buy recommendation. Shares are 1.1% lower at 889p. (Selina.williams@wsj.com)

1144 GMT Numis ups its target on Micro Focus International to 1220p from 1180p, but lowers its rating
on the business software group to hold from add following a strong share price performance. First-half
profit announced earlier Wednesday was ahead of Numis's expectations, but following the acquisition of
Attachmate, the shares are likely to "pause for breath while we wait for more insight on the opportunity"
the purchase offers. Shares are down 4.7% at 1078p. (rory.gallivan@wsj.com)

1139 GMT [Dow Jones]--With BP facing legal challenges from its 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and
political challenges from its ownership stake in Russia's state-controlled OAO Rosneft, the company has
focused on its dividends to keep investors from fleeing. In a presentation to investors today,
exploration-and-production chief Lamar McKay spoke of BP pursuing "a progressive dividend policy." But
that could require BP--which has already sold more than $40 billion in assets since 2010--to carry out
"further divestments to cover the dividend next year," Santander analyst Jason Kenney said today. And
that could be risky, he said, since low oil prices could make it hard to sell properties at a high enough
price to make it worth giving up production. Shares fall 0.3% to 404.65p. (justin.scheck@wsj.com)

1135 GMT Numis cuts PZ Cussons target price to 317p from 386p, after the British soap maker revealed
a 4% fall in 1H operating profits due to devaluation of the Nigerian Naira and unrest in the country.
Nigeria makes up 30% of the firm's annual revenue. The broker says the 1H trading update was not too
bad overall, but ongoing problems in Nigeria risks further downgrades. Numis also cuts its FY15 adjusted
pretax profit forecast to GBP109M, from GBP118.9M, and retains a hold recommendation. Shares are
trading 0.8% lower at 313p, off earlier lows. (tapan.panchal@wsj.com)

1132 GMT BG Group's sale of its QCLNG pipeline assets for $5 billion is better than expected and
positive for the stock agree analysts. This is despite the fact that the $2.7 billion post tax gain on the
completion of the sale will be partly offset by an around $2 billion writedown of the remaining QCLNG
assets, say analysts. "The price demonstrates the value from selling non-core infrastructure assets," says
Bernstein in a note to clients. Adds that the cash coming in from the pipeline sale can be used to reduce
debt and develop core oil and gas production assets. Has an outperform rating. BG shares are 1.2%
lower at 888p. (Selina.williams@wsj.com)

1121 GMT [Dow Jones]--PZ Cussons PLC (PZC.LN) may not be able to achieve a similar level of
earnings as last year, CFO Brandon Leigh says. He blames devaluation of the Nigerian naira for fall in
FY15 earnings. Nigeria makes up 30% of the soap manufacturer's annual revenue. Mr. Leigh says the
firm is undertaking a cost-reduction program to offset the challenges in Nigeria. PZ Cussons expects
GBP5M to GBP10M in FY15 cost savings. Shares trading 1.5% lower at 311P. (tapan.panchal@wsj.com)

1040 GMT Shares in Gulf Marine Services are down 36% since the end of September, much worse than
its U.K. peers, note analysts at Canaccord Genuity. They say over the same time-frame GMS has
secured a series of major awards. Given the number of recent awards, the brokerage has
comprehensively re-modelled GMS. "Our updated NAV for GMS is 168p...At our target price 180p, the
stock would trade at just 10.2/7.3x 2015/16E P/E (against a current sector average of 9x): ratings that are
underpinned by a robust backlog for both years. We therefore remain conviction buyers." Shares are
1.5% lower at 100p. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

1038 GMT [Dow Jones]--Investec cuts PZ Cussons PLC (PZC.LN) target price to 350P, from 386P, after
the British soap and shampoo manufacturer revealed a 4% fall in 1H operating profits due to devaluation
of Nigerian Naira and unrest in the country. Nigeria makes up 30% of the firm's annual revenue. The
broker says a more difficult Nigerian market plus some pre-existing currency headwinds and disposals
will likely prevent PZ Cussons from delivering profit growth in FY15. Investec retains hold, while it awaits
further clarity around Nigeria. Shares trading 0.8% lower at 313P. (tapan.panchal@wsj.com)

1036 GMT [Dow Jones]--With the support of a third shareholder in Songbird (SBD.LN), which controls
London's Canary Wharf, hostile bidders Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield (BPY) lay claim to
31.6% of Songbird's free float. The stock is tied up by QIA, Simon Glick (who reportedly opposes a deal),
China Investment Corp., and Morgan Stanley--recruiting every minority shareholder wouldn't take the
bidders across the line. Still, incremental progress could shift the balance of power among the big guys.
QIA and Brookfield have crossed the threshold above which China, with its 15.8%, could swing a vote.
To reach the level at which 8.5% shareholder Morgan Stanley could do so, they need roughly another
30% of the minority shareholders. Songbird shares unchanged. (ed.ballard@wsj.com; @edmballard)

1019 GMT Anglo American needs to realize some of its divestments early in 2015 to assuage investor
concerns that credit agencies might lower Anglo's credit rating next year, says Patrick Jones of Nomura.
Anglo's net debt is forecast to peak at $13.5 billion-$14 billion next year, post proceeds from the
Lafarge Tarmac JV sale, while commodity prices are forecast to remain weak. It plans to raise $3
billion-$4 billion by end 2016 from divestments but the sales need to happen more quickly to alleviate a

assets in South America, and coal assets in Australia and South Africa. Nomura has a neutral rating,
1400p target price. (alex.macdonald@wsj.com)

1014 GMT Anglo American PLC is delivering on its operational promises and has significant operational
upside as additional areas for improvement have been identified, says Jefferies. But "while management
has clearly made progress, it has not been enough to completely neutralize the ill effects of ongoing
commodity price weakness," it notes. "We are concerned that the sector--and Anglo shares--has further
to fall. It is too early to buy" Anglo shares Jefferies says, even though the stock is cheaper than any of the
other big five globally diversified miners on a P/E and EV/Ebitda multiple. Jefferies has a hold rating and
1250p target price on the stock. Anglo American shares are 0.3% lower at
1220p.(alex.macdonald@wsj.com)

0955 GMT [Dow Jones]--Anglo American's (AAL.LN) honeymoon is over, says Barclays. A year ago, the
miner set a target of reaching 15% ROCE in 2016. It is currently delivering a 6% to 8% ROCE given the
recent slump in commodity prices and set to generate a 12% ROCE in 2016 based on price forecasts for
that year. The initial ROCE target "is looking a lot less likely even with some of the operational
improvements the company can point to," says Barclays. "This leaves the stock looking vulnerable,
especially given not all the new guidance was positive." Anglo's investor day led the bank to downgrade
its 2015 EPS by 2% to $1.97 and upgrade its 2016 EPS forecast by 2% to $2.54, but overall the bank's
forecast remains intact. Barclays has an equal weight rating and a 1,550p target price on Anglo. Anglo
down 0.2% at 1,221p. (alex.macdonald@wsj.com)
