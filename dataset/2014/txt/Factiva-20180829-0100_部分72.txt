2014 MAY 10 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News --
StepStone Group LP ("StepStone" or the "Firm"), a leading global private markets firm, announced that it
has opened its first Latin American office in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and that the Firm has named Duncan
Littlejohn and Bruna Riotto, both formerly of Paul Capital in Brazil, as Partner and Vice President,
respectively. Their appointments are effective May 1, 2014. The Firm's new office will be located at Rua
Samuel Morse, 120 Cj. 83, 04576-060 Sao Paulo SP, Brazil.
Mr. Littlejohn and Ms. Riotto will be responsible for the Firm's investment activities in Latin America,
including reviewing primary, secondary and co-investment opportunities, and leading research efforts.
They will also handle client development in Brazil and the wider Latin America region.

"These strong additions to our team and office expansion allow us to enhance our global coverage of the
private markets," said Monte Brem, CEO of StepStone. "Investors, including institutions and family
offices, increasingly want access to private markets opportunities in Latin America, particularly in Brazil,
which has the largest economy and population in the region. As our clients increase the capital they
deploy there and Latin American clients look at global opportunities in alternative investments, we are
pleased to be able to offer a full-service local presence."

"We welcome Duncan and Bruna to the StepStone team," added StepStone partner Jose Fernandez.
"With talented and experienced Brazilians heading our new office, we will be well-positioned as we
continue to invest in Latin America and serve our clients based in the region. We believe in building local
teams with deep expertise in the markets in which we operate and we are sure that strategy will serve
StepStone and its clients well in Sao Paulo."
Mr. Littlejohn, 60, a 25 year veteran of the private equity industry in Latin America, joins StepStone from
Paul Capital, where he had led the firm's Latin American efforts since 2008. Previously, he was a Partner
of BPE Investimentos and its predecessor, Brasilpar, a Brazilian primary private equity fund manager,
which he joined in 1995. Prior to that, he worked in executive roles for companies such as AVM
Auto-equipamentos Ltda, Pirelli Fintec Ltda, S&W Berisford (UK) Group, and Productos Ecuatorianos
(Prodec). Mr. Littlejohn holds a BA in International Relations from the University of Pennsylvania. He has
served on the boards of multiple portfolio companies, non-profit organizations, ABVCAP (the Brazilian
private equity and venture capital association), and on various Latin American private equity fund
advisory boards.

Ms. Riotto, 29, also joins StepStone from Paul Capital, where she had been since 2010. While at Paul
Capital, Ms. Riotto was involved in all aspects of diligence, including company research, valuation,
portfolio analysis, and transaction structuring. Previously, she worked as a financial analyst within the
