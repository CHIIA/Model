Meat industry muster

MY young mate from many years past, Dennis Scanlon, who spent 40 years in Livestock and Meat
starting with the legendary Fred Keong at Oakey Abattoirs and finishing his working life as marketing
manager of AACo and Queensland livestock manager of Elders in 2003, is convening a fifth Livestock
and Meat Industry Muster in Toowoomba on Saturday, November 22.

Dennis said: "From very successful events over five years at Dalby, Gunnedah, Toowoomba and
Armidale, quite a few people are asking for another get-together at Toowoomba."

Peter Gilbert and his wife, Marlene, together with Russell Handley and his wife Janelle, have agreed to
be joint local hosts, Peter and Russell have researched a number of fine Restaurants in Toowoomba,
booking the prestigious Downs Club in the Central CBD area for a special dinner and evening.

Les Smiles originally a Dalby boy who made a big mark in both industries through eastern states who
with his wife Pat has hosted 'musters' in NSW, is also working to get the blue team ready for our
Toowoomba muster. Phone Les on (02) 6742 0590.
They are talking to motels/hotels in the area to arrange business rates for the night, and details and
contact numbers of these will be in an update article after the Brisbane Exhibition.

"The success of previous musters has been from people who have come together from many branches of
livestock and meat from meat processing families who owned and operated large meatworks, transport
companies, livestock agents many who were buyers as well as selling agents for their clients, meat
brokers, livestock managers and buyers, as well as many cattle, sheep and lamb producers who have
enjoyed being back among people they haven't caught up with for many years," Dennis told me.

"Of course, a good-quality dinner, a few drinks and some special guest speakers also help make the
occasion very interesting."

So keep the date free, ring Russell on 0418 120 605 or email handley2@westnet.com.au; or Peter on
0418 716 831 or peter@marpet.com.au to get the show rolling.

Tell all your mates in the two great industries, and spread the word at Ekka.

Town meets country bash

BRUCE Douglas, Ray White Rural, reminded me the forthcoming Town Meets Country event will once
again be held at the famed Breakfast Creek Hotel (with top Brekkie Creek manager Sam Gullo running
the ship)on the Wednesday evening before the Ekka, commencing at 6pm.

This event is always a top way to commence the Ekka festivities, when bush and city mates get together.

manager, stud stock. Trent has been with Landmark just on 10 years and has been based in
Rockhampton, Emerald, Injune, and has been the manager at the Blackall branch for the last
three-and-a-half years.

"I have been looking forward to getting into stud stock for some time as I am very passionate about the
beef industry and looking forward to marketing seed stock for Queensland stud producers," Trent said.

A previous winner of the Queensland Young Auctioneers competition, Trent represented the state in the
national finals at the Sydney Royal Show. Trent commences the new role from August 1. Tim Gregory
has been appointed as branch manager, Blackall. Tim brings with him a wealth of knowledge of the
agency business through his experience in a range of locations across eastern Australia over his 19 year
livestock agency and banking career.

RNA Ekka media launch

I HAD the pleasure of attending the best ever Ekka media launch held this week. It was also the launch of
an exciting new exhibit for this year's show. Regional Harvest is a collaboration between the regional
councils of the Lockyer Valley, scenic rim and the southern downs and will bring a great country flavour to
the show. The regions saw an opportunity to profile their agri-tourism to the biggest event in the state,
which includes all demographics in the community and will have a great display of their produce, tourism
and the people who make it happen in their areas.

Regional Harvest will feature information on what the regions have to offer and the tagline to the stand is
'Discover what's just down the road'. All of the regions are a short drive of three hours at the most from
Brisbane and can provide a wide range of activities for people to enjoy. Enjoy a picnic, go for a walk in a
national park, stay in a cosy B&B, taste medal winning wines and cheeses and much more. Just driving
through fields of vegetables is a pleasure and even better to purchase some to bring home.

A very exciting aspect of Regional Harvest will be the Regional Harvest Cafe, operated by well known
Brisbane chef Caroline Jones, owner of Three Girls Skipping Cafe in Graceville. Caroline grew up in
Blackall and Narrabri and knows what country cooking is about and will bring this style of food to the cafe
at the show. The food will only feature the produce of the scenic rim, southern downs and the Lockyer
Valley and will include freshly made soups, salads, roasted vegetable tarts and hot-out-of-the-oven
scones and muffins. The jewel in the crown of the cafe will be the cakes for which Caroline is justly
famous. There will also be children's packs full of country goodness.

Regional Harvest will be in the Agricultural Hall of the Ekka and will participate in the program on the
Garden Platform stage with presentations from chefs, farmers, winemakers and artisans of the regions.

The Regional Harvest stand will have a little grey 'Fergie' for old men to sit on and reminisce and young
children to have the thrill of the ride. This stand is a great innovation of the regional councils involved and
the three Mayors, Alan Jones AM Lockyer Valley, Peter Blundall southern downs and John Brent scenic
rim have co-operated to bring this taste of country to the city during the ten days of Ekka.

The regions have much to offer urban dwellers of Brisbane and this initiative, co-ordinated by Alison
Alexander and my old mate Allister Bassingthwaight and I reflected what a terrific concept this was.
Enjoying some of the brilliant food and RQWS trophy winning wine were my good friends Peter Lewis
and Kerry Lonergan from ABC and of course The Honorable Justice David Thomas RNA President, and
RNA vice-president Angus Adnam. Also, Elders livestock manager Cameron Wilson enjoyed the
proceedings and thanks Cameron for the lift.

What an Ekka we are in for this year! My favourite time of the year.
