CHINESE corporate giant Citic Pacific's disastrous $10 billion Sino Iron investment in Western
Australia is being seen as a key factor behind its $US36bn ($39bn) acquisition of a suite of assets
from its state-owned parent company.
The Hong Kong-based Citic Pacific said on Wednesday night that it would acquire 100 per cent of
Citic Limited, the business housing Citic Group's key assets.

The deal would top China Mobile's $32bn purchase of seven wireless networks from its parent to
be the largest such asset injection into a Hong Kong-listed unit by a Chinese company,
Bloomberg reported yesterday.
It would also turn Citic Pacific into the largest listed conglomerate in China.
Citic Pacific admitted last month it faced pressure to write down the value of Sino Iron project,
which was more than $US6bn over budget when it began exporting late last year.
The company has been engaged in a bitter legal dispute with federal MP Clive Palmer over
royalties and port access at the Pilbara project.
Citic bought the tenements that make up the Sino Iron project from Mr Palmer in 2006, but
construction of the project was beset by major technical difficulties.

``Citic's move is trying to save Citic Pacific itself, because Citic Pacific will enter a few years of great
difficulty because of its Australian mining project,'' said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo
Securities.
``The trend is to operate on market principles, tapping the market for funds as China goes from a
planned economy to an open economy.''

After peaking at $HK23.35 a share in April 2011, shares in Citic Pacific dropped as low as $HK7.95
last June. They have since rallied strongly.
