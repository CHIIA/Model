Toowoomba Elders
YARDING increased by 293 to 871 at this week’s sale.

Numbers increased and overall quality across the young cattle was very mixed.

There was a small number of good, heavy grown steers and bullocks penned and a relatively
small selection of cows.

Buyer attendance was very subdued, with two major export operators absent from the buying
panel, while the usual feeder buyers were present and operating.

Young cattle experienced a wide variation in price according to quality, with only well-bred lines
in demand.
Heavy grown steers and bullocks struggled to maintain a firm trend. Restockers competed
against processors on the plain-condition cows and prices experienced a small improvement,
while a few good heavy cows remained firm.

Vealer steers to feed and restockers averaged in the high 170c range, with sales to 185.2c/kg.

Vealer heifers to feed averaged 153c and slaughter classes averaged 136c/kg.

The largest number of medium-weight yearling steers to feed averaged 168c and the better lines
averaged 180c and sold to 193.2c/kg.

Heavyweights to feed averaged in the 170c range and made to 180c, with some returning to the
paddock at 191.2c/kg.

A large selection of lightweight yearling heifers averaged 137c and D-muscle lines averaged
112c/kg. Medium-weight yearling heifers to the trade averaged 176c, with a B-muscle class
reaching 219.2c/kg.
Heavy grown steers and bullocks mostly sold in the high 160c range, with the very occasional
sale to the local trade at 175c/kg.

Medium-weight two-score cows to processors averaged 101c and made to 108.2c/kg.
Good heavy cows made to 128.2c to average 125c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 139.2c/kg.

Toowoomba Landmark
NUMBERS climbed by 338 at this week’s sale to 657.

The trend of larger numbers continued and young cattle dominated the selling pens.

Page60of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The drift towards fewer operators in the export buying panel continued, while the usual feeder
operators were present, along with a small selection of restocker buyers.

Apart from some well-bred vealer steers receiving very strong demand, the majority of the
lightweight cattle met lacklustre demand, especially the heifer portion.

Medium and heavyweights to feed received fair demand, with only quality-related price changes.

Plain-condition cows improved in price due to stronger restocker support, while the good cows
remained firm.
A large number of calves returned to the paddock at 165c, with the occasional B-muscle class to
268.2c/kg.

Lightweight yearling steers to restockers averaged 164c and D-muscle lines averaged close to
140c/kg.

Medium-weight yearling steers to feed averaged 178c and made to 186.2c/kg.
Lightweight yearling heifers mostly sold in the early 130c range and D-muscle lines 94c/kg.

Medium-weight plain cows to restockers averaged close to 90c/kg.
Heavy three scores averaged 115c and good heavy cows averaged 124c and sold to 127.2c/kg.

Heavy bulls made 141.2c/kg.

Toowoomba O’Sullivan

AGENTS yarded 657 head on Monday.
Sale numbers increased this week, with more local cattle being yarded.

There was a good line-up of cows and again very few bullocks were yarded.

A good sample of feeder steers was on offer while feeder heifers met limited competition.

A couple of bazadaise- cross steers returned to the paddock as led steers for 251.2c and 268.2c.
Plain-condition cows remained firm with restocker competition, while the heavy prime cows were
slightly easier.

Vealers and lightweights met limited competition.

Restockers, feedlot operators and major meat buyers were all in competition together.
Gayleen Morice, Haden, sold quality bazadaise weaner steers, again sought- after by local
show-goers.
Her steers sold for 251.2c and 268.2c, with the draft average close to $2/kg, also selling weaner

Warwick cattle

Page61of232©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.AGENTS reported a fall of 119 to 1147 at the Warwick sale.

The supply of stock experienced a small decline and overall quality was mixed, with just a small
selection of well-presented classes suited to the local butcher trade.

Virtually no young heavy grown steers and bullocks were penned, however there was a small
selection of full mouth bullocks along with a fair line-up of cows.

The trend of very few operators in the export section continued, while the usual trade and feeder
buyers were present plus a few restocker operators.

Well-bred trade and feeder classes received strong competition, however any falling outside
slaughter and feed specifications met lacklustre demand.

Plain-condition cows improved in price while good heavy cows lost a further 5c/kg.

Most of the calves return to the paddock at 143c, with a few sales to 181.2c/kg.
Vealer steers to restockers averaged 183c and sold to 193c/kg.

Dalby cattle

May 21 report:

NUMBERS fell by 342 to a total of 4255.

The supply of stock experienced a small decline and similar to other markets no good-quality
heavy grown steers and bullocks were penned and there was a 33% reduction in the number of
cows available.

The usual feeder buyers were present and operating.

However export processor attendance continued to be erratic and not all the major buyers were
present; this trend also flowed into the young cattle section, with some interstate operators
absent from the buying panel.

Young lightweight cattle experienced a mixed trend, with well-bred lines of vealer steers and
vealer heifers improving in price, while lightweight yearling heifers struggled to maintain a firm
trend.

Medium and heavyweight yearling steers to feed experienced only quality- related price
changes.

The plain-quality selection of heavy grown steers and bullocks remained unchanged in price.

Cows regained some of the previous week’s losses to improve by 4c to 7c/kg.

Vealer steers to feed and restockers made to 208.2c, with most in the 190c/kg range.
