1923 ET [Dow Jones] -- Iron-ore prices have crept higher, bouncing from five-year lows to regain their
footing at the "psychological US$80/ton barrier," says ANZ. While any lift in prices will help the many
producers struggling to break even at current levels, the steelmaking commodity remains down 40%
year-to-date after a surge in mine supply. Still, the immediate outlook for prices remains unclear, analysts
say. Market liquidity remains weak, with many Chinese buyers having been absent for the so-called
Golden Week holiday. China is the world's largest buyer of the raw material. Spot iron-ore lifted 1.4% on
Tuesday to US$80.00/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

11:24 GMT [Dow Jones] A tough start to the TV advertising market in FY15 is probably more cyclical
than structural, meaning a recent sell-off in Seven West Media (SWM.AU) is overdone, says Deutsche
Bank, which upgrades its recommendation on the Australian media group to buy from hold. Advertising
volumes in 1Q15 are likely to be down around 10% on-year, but mostly because of a spike in
government advertising last year for national elections. "Our discussions with media buyers suggest a
number of advertisers are increasing marketing spend, and, given that audiences for key events are
continuing to hold up, we view the current issues around the TV ad market as cyclical rather than
structural. The broker raises its price target to A$2.00 from A$1.90. SWM is down 1.5% at A$1.60.

23:25 GMT [Dow Jones] Citi initiates coverage of AGL Energy (AGK.AU) with a buy recommendation
and A$15.56 price target, noting the energy retailer has underperformed its peers and the ASX100 over
the last six months. It also likes its recent acquisition of Macquarie Generation in New South Wales
state, which it says the market is undervaluing. "MacGen's location in the Upper Hunter valley and
burning low quality, non-exportable coal means that it has a structural coal cost advantage," it says,
valuing the asset at A$1.9 billion-to-A$2.0 billion, or A$2.90/share. AGK is down 0.4% at
A$13.53.(Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
2321 GMT [Dow Jones] Gold's slide to around $1,210/oz. can be explained not just by a stronger U.S.
dollar--the pair tend to share an inverse correlation--but by easing concerns about inflation, according to
HSBC precious metals analyst James Steel. "The decline in inflation expectations has played a
secondary role in pressuring gold," he says, noting the U.S. 10-year break-even yield--a proxy for the
market's inflation expectations--has fallen to a 15-month low. "A lack of inflationary expectations is
traditionally bearish for gold," which is often bought as an alternative store of value, says Mr. Steel.

23:21 GMT [Dow Jones] Part of the decline in mall traffic among U.S. teenagers can be attributed to the
establishment of mall curfews and added security in the 2000s, according to analysts at Piper Jaffray in
their semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens report on teenage consumer behavior. The average number
of annual mall trips by teens aged 13-19 has fallen 26% to 29 visits per year from its peak in 2007, the
firm notes, due in part to the beefed up security against "disruptive" teens, as well as other factors
including the rise of e-commerce and decline of logo-based fashion trends. To illustrate the imposing
nature of mall security, the firm includes within the note a standalone screen grab of the DVD cover of
"Mall Cop," a 2009 film starring Kevin James. (sara.germano@wsj.com @germanotes)

19:20 ET [Dow Jones] Travel insurer Cover-More Group (CVO.AU) is a good way to bet on changing
travel preferences among Australians, according to Bell Potter. The broker expects the longer-term
structural shift toward outbound versus domestic holiday travel to continue, despite slowing growth in

Page13of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.outbound departures in August. "The best way to play this recovery is through CVO given its travel
insurance business is leveraged to short-term international departure volumes for holiday purposes," the
broker says. It notes that Cover-More isn't adversely impacted by any offsetting decline in international
airfares, in contrast to Flight Centre (FLT.AU), given premiums change only marginally based on the
price of travel. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar is among the G-10 currency basket's current top 10
performers having rallied overnight on the back of short-covering to a high around $0.8834. It has
covered a lot of ground quickly. After U.S. payrolls on Friday, it had been trading around $0.8650. In the
absence of key domestic data, the Aussie dollar is expected to trade quietly until the release of
September employment data on Thursday. Greg Moore, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets said China PMI data will be the most significant data in Asia followed by the release of
September FOMC minutes. AUD/USD now $0.8809. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

[Dow Jones] 22:47 Empired (EPD.AU), an Australian company that provides information technology
services to business, offers a more technical and customized package than rivals, justifying a buy
recommendation and A$0.95 price target, says Bell Potter. The bullish call comes despite the company
last month issuing new shares at a discount to potentially fund acquisitions, prompting Bell Potter to
downgraded its per share earnings forecast by 8-10% over the next three financial years. Part of its price
target is dependent on the company making an acquisition in the next few months. "So we are giving
the company the benefit of the doubt at this stage but the clock is ticking," the broker says. Empired was
last at A$0.745. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

Bell Potter trims its earnings forecasts for BT Investment Management (BTT.AU) to reflect
mark-to-market adjustments and expectations of a lower performance feel in fiscal 2015 but says the
short-term weakness in equity markets provides an opportunity to buy the shares. Bell Potter's price
target falls to A$8.10/share from A$8.40. It lowers its earnings estimate by 2.1% for FY14, by 8.8% for
FY15 and by 5.4% for FY16. It anticipates a record closing funds-under-management balance of A$65.6
billion in the September quarter, with strong growth likely achieved in the higher-margin JO Hambro
business. BTT last traded at A$5.90. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

18:30 EDT - The largest U.S. airline-pilots union warned federal air-safety experts to go slow in
embracing new technologies to "stream" real-time data off planes, enhance global tracking and install
video recorders to keep track of cockpit crews. Charles Hogeman, a senior safety official with the Air Line
Pilots Association, told a public forum today that his members remain opposed to cockpit video recorders
without assurance of "the appropriate level of security" to prevent unauthorized distribution of images. He
said videos -- a point of contention between pilots and NTSB officials -- won't necessarily provide "that
increase of information" advocates expect to better understand incidents or accidents. Mr. Hogeman
pointedly warned against knee-jerk reactions to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's disappearance, which he
described as "a single event that has not really been understood" or fully explained by investigators.

17:48 EDT - In the latest attempt by the soda industry to lure back lapsed soda drinkers, PepsiCo (PEP)
hopes to tap consumer nostalgia by launching a "craft" cola called "Caleb's Kola" that will be sold at
Costco stores in a handful of cities, according to industry tracker Beverage Digest. Caleb refers to Caleb
Bradham, the North Carolina pharmacist credited with creating Pepsi-Cola more than a century ago.
Caleb's Kola is made from water, kola nut extract and sugar, not the high fructose corn syrup used to
sweeten today's Pepsi. US soda consumption has been declining since peaking in the late 1990s, with
cola faring even worse, amid shifting consumer tastes and rising obesity concerns. PEP is launching
another variant, Pepsi True, sweetened with sugar and stevia, on Amazon this month.

17:32 EDT - Optimism among small US firms is running at a three-year high, the Principal Financial
Group says. In a survey of 600 business owners with fewer than 500 employees, 40% said they had a
positive outlook for 2015, up from 26% in 2012. Just over half said their company's financials improved
in the past year, with 71% reporting surplus capital. A separate survey of 1,000 small firms by Bank of
America, also released today, said owners were "content but cautious" about the year ahead. Similarly, a
WSJ/Vistage survey last month reported rising optimism among small firms, citing geopolitical conflicts
as a potential threat to growth. (angus.loten@wsj.com)
