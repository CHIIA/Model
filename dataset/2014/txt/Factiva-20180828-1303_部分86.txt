1053 GMT Rio Tinto PLC's (RIO) higher-than-anticipated cost savings and lowered FY14 capital
expenditure guidance show executives are serious about austerity, says Sam Twidale, a London-based
analyst at Schroders. "That is exactly what the market was looking for," he says. Twidale says some
investors were worried Rio "might start communicating a higher [future capex] number to strike balance
between growth and guidance." Rio should still behave relatively cautiously, he argues, given uncertainty
over China's outlook and the effect rising iron-ore supply is having on the commodity's price. "All eyes
now are really on early 2015 and the full-year result when shareholders will be looking to see some cash
come back," he says. Schroders holds Rio Tinto shares in its funds. In London, shares are up 1.6% at
3445p. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

0856 GMT [Dow Jones]--Numis Securities raises its Savills PLC (SVS.LN) forecast after the real estate
services firm posted strong 1H earnings, with pretax profit up 15% and underlying profit up 16%. The
broker has increased 2014 underlying pretax profit to GBP90 million, from GBP85.5 million and EPS to
51.3p, from 48.6p. 2015 underlying pretax profit has been increased to GBP105m, from GBP100.3
million while EPS has been increased to 58.7p, from 56.0p. "The main driver of this upgrade is the U.S.,
where the Studley business has been integrated effectively, and we now expect annualized cost saving
synergies of $1m due to the integration of the old Savills business into Studley's premises," Numis said. It
has a buy rating on the stock and 761p target price. Shares up 18p, or 3.13%, at 592p.

0834 GMT [Dow Jones]--Rio Tinto's first-half results "give grounds for confidence in Rio's ability to deliver
growth and contain key costs in a difficult pricing environment," says Sanford C. Bernstein, with earnings
per share of $2.77 beating both Bernstein's estimate and consensus. Says a 3% rise in Rio's ebitda is
creditable performance given falling iron ore prices, achieved partly through cost improvements.
Bernstein reckons Rio's iron ore operations remain "world-beating" given their high quality geology,
proximity to Asian markets and access to strong rail and port infrastructure, while its copper and
aluminium businesses should soon start to make a meaningful contribution to Rio's profit. Rates Rio at
Outperform; shares up 1.8%. (andrew.peaple@wsj.com)

0828 GMT [Dow Jones]--Aviva (AV) remains firmly on the road to recovery, working hard to make its
relatively recent travails a distant memory, Hargreaves Lansdown says, after the insurer reported a good

Page227of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.set of 1H earnings with most key metrics either in line or above expectations. "The strategy of cost
containment, disposal of non-core assets and debt reduction are continuing to show signs of progress,"
Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers says. Investors are beginning to
believe in Aviva's recovery story, with the market consensus having recently strengthened slightly to a
buy, Mr. Hunter adds. Shares up 14 pence, or 2.8%, at 504 pence. (ian.walker@wsj.com)

0826 GMT [Dow Jones]--Citi Research lifts its target price on Hikma Pharmaceuticals (HIK.LN) to 2000p
from 1850p, and says the pharmaceutical company's recent acquisition of Bedford Labs could be a
transformational deal for the group. "We see the potential for Bedford Labs to be similarly
transformational as the 2011 acquisition of Baxter's MSI business, which doubled Hikma's Injectables
portfolio," Citi says. The broker maintains its buy stance. Shares +0.4% at 1702p.

0826 GMT [Dow Jones]--Numis Securities upgrades Hargreaves Lansdown PLC (HL.LN) to buy from
hold after recent share price weakness. Retains 1,220p target, saying the investment services firm is
benefiting from the structural pensions shift to defined contribution from defined benefit. Expects
Hargreaves to continue to deliver strong growth in assets under administration for the foreseeable future.
Numis has, however, cuts its FY15 EPS forecast by 2% to 40.0p and FY16 forecast by 3.8% to 45.9p.
Assumes margins will continue to fall as direct to retail platform market moves to a mass market from a
niche one. (tapan.panchal@wsj.com)

0819 GMT [Dow Jones]--Despite forecasting a 5% reduction in net debt this year for Enterprise Inns PLC
(ETI.LN), broker Numis remains cautious about the UK pub firm, saying, "there is still much to be done to
turn the business." The third quarter IMS shows that the company benefited from the World Cup and a
better start to summer. Enterprise is making progress in many areas, but beer volumes are continuing to
fall sharply in the wet-led pub segment and weather-comps in the fourth quarter are tough, Numis adds,
reiterating a Hold rating and 125p target price. Shares up 2.1% at 122p. (razak.baba@wsj.com; Twitter:

0816 GMT [Dow Jones]--Rio Tinto's (RIO.LN) first half results are a "very strong set of numbers," says
Liberum Capital, mainly due to improved cash flow thanks to its reduced capital spending. Notes Rio cut
its 2014 capex guidance to $9 billion from $11 billion; but says the miner's long term capex guidance
has been raised with Rio now expecting $8 billion annual spend over the medium term. With no
offsetting output growth, that means Rio's free cash flow yield is likely to decline, reducing Liberum's
estimate of Rio's net present value. Maintains sell recommendation, with a price target of GBP28; Rio is
up 1.5% in London at 3443p. (andrew.peaple@wsj.com)

0814 GMT [Dow Jones]--Canaccord Genuity lifts its stance on Afren (AFR.LN) to speculative buy from
hold for risk-tolerant investors. The broker says the oil & gas company's share price has weakened to
around 100p, leaving 19% potential upside to its 120p target price. "Afren has an attractive portfolio of
producing assets, development projects, and early stage developments, offering growth through to the
latter part of this decade," Canaccord says. Shares +1.8% at 102.4p. (jana.simmons@wsj.com)

Page228of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.0802 GMT [Dow Jones]--Rio Tinto (RIO) trades 1.8% higher at 3452p after releasing solid 1H results,
notes Jefferies. The mining giant is one of Jefferies top picks in the sector, combining a "strong
operational performance, low operating risk, bullet-proof balance sheet, leading FCF growth, and
inexpensive valuation." Has a buy rating, with a target price of 4100p. Adds Rio should also benefit from
relative stability in the iron ore price in the short term and a higher iron ore price in 4Q as seaborne
supply growth significantly decelerates. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0739 GMT [Dow Jones] UK insurer Aviva (AV.LN) produced 1H results that were either in line, or just
ahead of expectations on every metric, notes Panmure Gordon. Operating profits rose 4% and the
interim dividend was up 4.5% to 5.85p. Panmure believes the outlook for the final dividend is particularly
positive, and maintains a Buy recommendation on the share with a Target Price of 585p. The shares
trade 0.9% higher Thursday at 494p. (gary.stride@wsj.com)
