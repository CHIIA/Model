RWE (CM) SouthGobi Resources Announces Second Quarter 2014 Financial and Operating Results

Sydney - Monday - August 11 (RWE) - SouthGobi Resources Ltd [TSX:SGQ] today announced its
financial and operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.

All figures are in US Dollars unless otherwise stated.
Significant Events and Highlights The company's significant events and highlights for the three months
ended June 30, 2014 and subsequent period to August 11, 2014 are as follows: The company continues
to operate under difficult market conditions.
Coal prices in China declined further in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2014 in
response to excess seaborne and Chinese domestic supply.
The decline in coal prices has been partially offset by the increase in the company's volumes in the
second quarter compared to the seasonally slow first quarter.
Production decreased to 0.55 million tonnes of raw coal in the second quarter of 2014 compared to
production of 0.64 million tonnes of raw coal in the first quarter of 2014.
This decrease in production is due to the company's decision in June in response to current market
conditions to reduce its production and place approximately half of its workforce in furlough.

This furlough is anticipated to remain in place until the end of August subject to market conditions.
On May 25, 2014, the company announced it obtained a $10 million revolving credit facility from
Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd to meet its short term working capital requirements with a maturity date of
August 30, 2014.
At June 30, 2014 the company had drawn down $3.8 million under this facility.
The company completed the sale of Tsagaan Tolgoi mining license in the second quarter of 2014.
The net proceeds generated for the company after taxes and disposal costs was $1.3 million and was
received in April 2014.
The trial date for the tax investigation case against the company's Mongolian subsidiary SouthGobi
Sands LLC and three of its former employees as detailed in the company's announcement of June 24,
2014 has been deferred until August 25, 2014.
