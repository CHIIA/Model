Current Environment

Sector Overview

Economic growth throughout the Asia-Pacific over the past six months led to a rise in the consumption of
oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a result of booming vehicle use and industrial growth, especially in
China. Energy demand continued to rise significantly across developing Asia, driven by shifting
economic, environmental and geopolitical factors, coinciding with a very tight global oil supply. The global
growth of new oil supply hardly exceeded declining production from the world's large older oil fields,
causing a very slight overall net supply increase.
Oil prices peaked at US$115.19 on June 19, 2014, before bottoming at US$99.37 a barrel on August 18
and then fluctuating upwards. Oil prices were relatively high in the second quarter of 2014 before hitting a
low in the third quarter. This had significant economic implications as oil provides 60% of the world's
energy needs, with the other 40% coming from coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, solar, tidal power and
biomass.
Asia-Pacific oil consumption growth was the second highest globally, 47%, after the Middle East's 57%,
while consumption in the European Union (EU) fell by 5% and in the US by 3%. The decline in EU and US
consumption was due to the shift from oil to gas and renewable energy.

Natural gas consumption continued to rise strongly over the past six months, as it did in the past decade,
to fuel booming industrial needs and power generation. Asia accounted for 70% of the world's LNG
market, and the strong demand combined with oil-linked LNG pricing, drove Asia-Pacific prices higher.

Page51of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The demand was intensified by a sudden rise in demand from Japan to meet its electricity needs following
the shutdown of its nuclear generators.

Natural gas continued to be the key to Asia-Pacific economic growth and environmental progress, with
energy demand estimated to grow by 59% over the next three decades, after steady increases over the
past decade. Natural gas can meet more of the demand for electricity, chemicals and plastics, improving
quality of life and reducing environmental impact at the same time. Natural gas will slowly continue to
replace coal as the region's second biggest energy source, with the upstream oil and gas market offering
new business opportunities for the growing number of independent and expanding state oil companies.

Closing Stock Prices

The share prices of the top ten Asia-Pacific oil and natural gas companies by revenue rose by an average
19.98% over the six months to June 30, 2014, when crude oil closed at US$111.03 per barrel. Six
companies' share prices finished higher, while those of four ended weaker. The best performer was
Hindustan Petroleum Corp (BSE: HPCL), whose shares started at Rs232.40 (US$3.83) on January 2 and
rose steadily to a high of Rs455.80 (US$7.52) on June 6, before ending the period at Rs416.20 (US$6.87)
on June 30. Another company whose shares did well was Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOCL) (BSE: IOC ),
starting at Rs205.80 (US$3.40), rising steadily to a high of Rs366.50 (US$6.05) on June 6, ending the
period at Rs344.60 (US$5.69).

e worst performing stock was that of Petronas Dagangan Bhd (KLSE: PETD), whose share price was
stable in the first four months before fluctuated downward. Starting at RM30.98 (US$9.70) on January 2, it
plunged to a period low of RM23.30 (US$7.30) on May 26, ending slightly higher at RM24.04 (US$7.53)
on June 30. Another company that did badly was China National Offshore Oil Co Ltd (CNOOC) (HKSE:
883), whose share price started at HK$14.38 (US$1.86) on January 2, fell to a period low of HK$11.54
(US$1.49) on February 4, peaked at HK$14.12 (US$1.82) on June 19, and ended at HK$13.92 (US$1.80)
on June 30.

Leading Companies
All major oil companies in the region continued to climb back from recession, and benefited from a
recovering global economy that spurred rises in crude prices, although the regional production and
domestic refining margins of many leading companies declined.
China National Offshore Oil Co Ltd (CNOOC) (HKSE: 883)

Page52of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.China's biggest offshore oil producer CNOOC reported revenue of RMB138,800 million (US$22,555
million) for the first half of 2014, a decrease of 0.2% from a year earlier, and net profit by 2.3% to
RMB33,593 million (US$5,458.86 million). Its realized oil price increased by 2% to US$106.30 per barrel
and realized gas price by 13.5% to US$6.44 per 1,000 cubic feet. Production levels were up by 6.8% from
a year earlier to 211.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with crude and liquids increased by 6.3% to
171.3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) and natural gas by 9.1% to 233.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The
company's exploration program was a success with nine new discoveries and 23 successful appraisal
wells.
Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOCL) (BSE: 530965)
State-owned IOCL reported a net profit of Rs7,019.09 crore (US$1,158.15 million) for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 40.2% from a year earlier. Revenue rose by 5.8% from a year
earlier to Rs473,210.09 crore (US$78,079.66 million) and earnings per share by 40.3% to Rs28.91
(US$0.48). The company has increased its presence in the upstream sector and enhanced its capability
in exploration and production (E&P).

It has participating interests in 13 domestic and nine overseas blocks and made discoveries in some of
them, while many others are undergoing geological and geophysical studies. IOCL had an excellent
operational performance in the just concluded fiscal year, surpassing all previous records. Its pipeline
throughput was 73.069 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products, a decrease of 3.2% from the
previous year.

Petronas Dagangan Bhd (Petronas) (KLSE: PETD)
Petronas is Malaysia's most profitable firm and the country's only company in the Fortune 500. Its first
half 2014 profit before tax of RM55,267million (US$17,309.62 million) was 8.8% up from a year earlier.
Revenue rose 12.1% from a year earlier to RM169,408 million (US$53,058.59 million) mainly due to
higher oil and gas production volume from Iraq and South Sudan, higher petroleum products and LNG
trading volume and higher processed gas sales volume, coupled with the effect of favorable US dollar
exchange rate movement against the ringgit.
Its cash flow from operating activities increased by 6.1% to RM49,397 million (US$15,471.14 million)
and total production rose by 5.6% from 2,115 thousand boe per day to 2,234 thousand boe per day.
Crude oil and condensate production volume was higher mainly due to production resumption in South
Sudan, production enhancement efforts and new production stream from Iraq and Malaysia. Natural gas
production was higher due to additional production from Canada, higher demand in Turkmenistan and
production optimization efforts for Sarawak operations.

Mergers and Acquisitions
The rate of Asia-Pacific oil and gas mergers and acquisitions (M&A ) picked up slowly over the six months
under review, amid a slowdown in the global economy and sanctions on Iranian oil. The motivation for
deals varied in different countries and companies. China and India's national oil companies (NOCs)
continued their quest to acquire as much technology and knowledge as possible from their western
partners to exploit their own huge unconventional assets, while Malaysia and South Korea focused on
diversifying their reserves and production bases to boost national energy self-sufficiency.

High growth in emerging markets, over-capacity in developed regions and the need to develop new and
efficient technology solutions for company development also drove M&As. Japan actively acquired
overseas gas assets to replace lost nuclear power capacity after the Fukushima nuclear plant crisis, and
to secure supplies of LNG before long-term contracts expire.

Regional companies also focused on portfolio management and concentrated on core business, given
high oil prices and gradual economic recovery, and made M&As to gain market share. In August 2014,
Medco Tunisia Petroleum Ltd, the subsidiary of PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk has completed the
acquisition of 100% of the shares of storm Ventures International (Barbados) Ltd with the base
purchase price of US$114 million. Total value of the transaction is US$127.7 million, including an
amount payable for working capital, US$13.7 million.

With the effective economic date of January 1, 2014, MedcoEnergi has working interest in eight areas
which comprise of four exploration areas, two development areas and two production areas in the
Pelagian Basin off the northeast coast of Tunisia. Total estimated net recoverable resources are
approximately 33.8 million boe as of December 31, 2013. With this transaction, it expands the
company's E&P asset portfolio in overseas and supports the company's growth agenda. Those assets
have lots of potential to grow and will contribute significantly in Tunisia's oil and gas production, and
MedcoEnergi will be one of the leading E&P players in Tunisia in the future.

Page53of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.While M&As might not offer much immediate return, they should boost reserves and production of NOCs
in the long term and help companies diversify from declining domestic reserves. They are important for
energy security and supplement domestic crude oil and natural gas production.

Industry Profile

Industry Size and Value
The Asia-Pacific has less than 4% of the world's proven oil reserves, and the industry has few options to
expand or maintain its current levels of production. The region has large coal reserves, the primary
energy source in China and India, while the rest of the region relies on crude oil. The developing
countries will consume 94% of the oil consumed by industrialized countries by 2025, and oil is likely to
remain the world's foremost source of primary energy over the next two decades.

Australia remains a significant player in the global LNG market, due to the development of its offshore gas
resources and onshore unconventional gas reserves. Australia, ranked 11th in global natural gas reserves
and fourth in LNG exports, has the potential to become the leading LNG exporting country, overtaking
Qatar. Currently, Australian LNG is expensive, costing 20% more to deliver to Japan than LNG from
Canada and the US. Floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) will be the solution to reduce the cost and
unlock stranded gas. FLNG is a water-based LNG operation that enables the development of offshore
natural gas resources by floating above an offshore natural gas field. FLNG facilities can produce, liquefy,
store and transfer LNG at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets.

Australia will be among the first countries to use FLNG technology, with several projects under
development, such as Royal Dutch Shell 's (LSE: RDSA) Prelude project, off Western Australia, and GDF
Suez 's Bonaparte FLNG project, off Northern Australia. FLNG requires revolutionary technology to solve
technical and execution challenges. It offers environmental benefits over conventional offshore LNG that
involves transport pipelines to shore, which could be several hundred kilometers away, and to an onshore
processing facility, all of which involve construction materials and seabed and land disturbance. FLNG
also reduces the impact on sensitive coastal habitats as it excludes the need for shoreline pipe crossing,
dredging and jetty works.

FLNG facilities allow economic access to large reserves from offshore fields previously considered
stranded gas, and are cheaper per tonne to build with a lighter environmental footprint than conventional
LNG and other fossil fuel energy sources. The technology is not limited to offshore Western Australia or
the previously considered stranded gas, but can also be used in regions where security issues prevent
onshore processing.
Oil and Gas Production and Consumption
The level of overall oil and gas production and consumption in the region increased slightly over the past
six months despite a weak global economy. Asia-Pacific crude oil proved reserves grew by 1.1% from a
year earlier to 45.875 billion barrels in 2014. Production fell by 1% to 8,935.4 thousand bbl/d in 2013,
while consumption rose by 3.6% to 29,782.9 thousand bbl/d in 2012.

The Asia-Pacific's proved natural gas reserves rose by 3.4% from a year earlier to 539.203 trillion cubic
feet (Tcf) in 2014, as the region tried to replace oil and coal with natural gas to reduce carbon footprints
and greenhouse effects. Production levels were up by 1.1% from a year earlier to 18,660 Bcf in 2012,
consumption by 6.3% to 23,625 Bcf and imports by 6.5% to 9,663 Bcf, while exports fell by 5.3% to 4,023
Bcf. China's gas production grew rapidly with new pipelines and exploration of gas potential basins,
especially in the western interior and offshore. It has the world's longest gas pipeline that began operating
in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Australia's gas industry is also growing rapidly, with its deep waters providing long-term gas production
growth. Fields throughout the North West Shelf are being developed to supply a growing domestic market
and to expand LNG export capacity. New large deepwater discoveries in eastern India are also being
developed, leading to higher gas output to replace that from Mumbai where production has peaked.

Industry Focus
Strengthening Energy Security
Asia is the second largest gas-consuming region, and demand is rising quickly. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) estimates that the LNG market will expand by a third from 2011 to 2017. The demand for oil
is also growing, and the region is exposed to potential petroleum supply disruption in the Middle East,
where Iran currently threatens to block access for oil tankers to the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20%
of the world's oil passes.

Page54of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.A major disruption in the strait could increase oil prices to US$160 per barrel and trigger a severe crisis in
Japan. Without nuclear power to diversify its energy mix, Japan's federal deficit could reach Y12 trillion
(US$112.8 billion), an associate for energy security and sustainability at Japan's Institute of Energy
Economics estimates. Nuclear plants generated 30% of Japan's electricity before the Fukushima disaster,
and the country has subsequently raised its imports of natural gas and introduced policies to boost
renewable energy development. Without nuclear power, Japan is finding it hard to meet energy security
goals.
Indonesia, a prominent regional producer of oil and gas, will need at least two more oil refineries to meet
50% of its fuel oil needs until 2020. Even with the construction of refineries with a capacity of 300 million
bbl/d, the country will continue to be a net oil importer until 2025. Pertamina , the Indonesian state-owned
oil and natural gas corporation, believes that demand for oil will continue to grow parallel with
consumption in the transportation and industrial sectors, from 454.75 million barrels a year in 2013 to
850.38 million barrels in 2025.
China has urged Asian and European countries to boost their cooperation on energy security, disaster
prevention and alleviation. It has also urged energy producers and consumers in Asia and Europe to work
together to create a new principle of mutually beneficial cooperation, diversified forms of development and
common energy security through coordination. Both regions need to develop clean and renewable
energy, improve energy structure, stabilize prices, safeguard market stability, improve efficiency, and
build energy-saving modes of production and consumption. Asian countries have acquired wide
experience in disaster prevention, while European countries have developed the latest technology.
To boost energy security, China is urging the two regions to coordinate their policies, build a cooperative
mechanism for emergency rescue in major disasters and provide mutual humanitarian assistance. China
also recommends establishing an efficient information exchange channel to improve disaster monitoring
and early warning and strengthen cooperation on the application of space technology in disaster
prevention and alleviation. China has also suggested that countries share experience and improve their
disaster prevention and alleviation ability through personnel exchange and training.
For Asia to reduce gas prices and improve energy security the region needs better physical connections
between its various energy and electricity supplies. This was done by Europe to achieve relative energy
security, and Asia could create such a super-grid by incorporating existing and new pipelines within Asia
and those from Russia.

Policy and Regulatory Environment
Policies and regulations for all Asia-Pacific oil and gas industries are revised when the need arises to
make them relevant and coherent with current markets and economic environments. Among the recent
measures have been Myanmar Government reforming foreign investment laws, where the regime is made
up of Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (2012) (FIL), Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development No.11/2013, Foreign Investment Rules (FIR), Myanmar Investment Commission Notification
No.1/2013 (MIC Notification) and The State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No.9/89 (SOEEL).

The Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED) is the government ministry
responsible for foreign investment, while Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) carries out
administrative and regulatory function. In June 2014, MIC became an independent organization to
encourage foreign direct investment in Myanmar.

The FIL applies to businesses that are not expressly prohibited and are listed economic activities under
the MIC Notification. Foreigners must invest in oil and gas through a joint venture with a Myanmar citizen
that could be an individual or corporation, with a shareholding split of 80% to 20%. Although this can be
amended by MIC and there is subjective evidence to suggest that, the provision is not strictly enforced,
especially with regard to more technical areas such as deep water offshore E&P activities, as long as
there is a degree of local content. Under the SOEEL, investment in oil and gas is only permissible
following approval from the Government and Myanmar's Ministry of Energy (MOE).
In order to obtain a permit from MIC, an oil and gas investor must first apply for a recommendation from
MOE. Under the FIR, within seven days of the receipt of a recommendation request, MOE must then give
its recommendation or otherwise to MIC for a final investment decision. Under draft environment
regulations, which are applied in practice, as well as provisions contained in the MIC Notification, the
application for MIC approval must now contain the Initial Environment Examination (IEE). The permit from
MIC must be given within 90 days from the date of receipt of MOE recommendation. The further content
of the Government's approval and recommendation is not precisely specified in the MIC Notification.

Market Trends and Outlook
Asian companies are turning to unconventional gas to cut their reliance on imported energy, alleviate
environmental damage and improve energy security.Growing Asian nations, especially China and India
have led the world's oil demand over the past few years. The IEA expects Indian oil demand to rise by
3.9% annually and Chinese demand by 3.5% annually until 2030.Asian equity capital continued to flow
into private North American oil and gas companies, continuing the trend for past four years.
The region's search for a more secure oil and LNG supply has driven it towards greater dependence on
and engagement in key oil and gas exporting regions, especially the Persian Gulf and the Middle East.

Market Trends & Outlook

Asian Development of Unconventional Gas Increases
Asian economies are turning to unconventional gas to cut their reliance on imported energy, mitigate
environmental damage and improve energy security. China, India and Thailand already consume more
gas than they produce, and that gap will widen unless they can boost their production of unconventional
resources such as tight gas, shale gas and coal bed methane. Energy ministers from Asia- Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC ) countries recognize the need to explore ways to secure supplies other
than from conventional gas.

The growth in shale gas in the US is having ripple effects on gas pricing throughout the world, including
Asia. Japanese companies are looking at Henry Hub pricing for natural gas, due to the correlation
between that benchmark and the price Japan must pay to secure gas on the spot market. The prospects
for continuing or have more rapid growth in production, both in the US and elsewhere, are pressuring mid
and long-term price assumptions. The US Department of Energy 's latest long-term forecast expects
shale gas production to reach more than 12 Bcf per day by 2020, and 17 Bcf per day by 2035. Asian
companies are forming alliances with western firms who are familiar with the technology used in the US
shale gas sector and are trying to secure a stand in that market themselves.
China is set to exploit more unconventional gas reserves to meet rising demand and to power its rapid
economic growth as it grapples with energy shortages and climate change. The National Energy
Administration (NEA ) estimates China has huge unconventional gas resources, and that increasing
unconventional gas production could ease oil demand, dodge rising costs of oil production and cut
carbon emissions. China's coal-based energy consumption mode is changing as the country seeks to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 40% to 45% from 2005
levels by 2020.
The Government is encouraging the use of more natural gas to meet its growing domestic energy needs,
while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by using cleaner-burning gas and renewable energy
resources. E&P companies are learning from foreign companies experienced in shale gas drilling how to
explore for and develop China's untapped shale gas resources. The development of shale gas has raised
environmental concerns, including the possible pollution of groundwater supplies. However, most industry
experts are confident that unconventional gas might soon become an additional alternative source of
energy.
Asia-Pacific Continues to Lead Oil Demand Growth

Page56of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The growing Asian nations, especially China and India, have led the world's oil demand over the past few
years. The IEA expects Indian oil demand to rise by 3.9% annually and Chinese demand by 3.5%
annually until 2030. Chinese oil demand is expected to more than double to 16.3 million bbl/d by 2030,
from 7.7 million bbl/d in 2008, while Indian demand could jump from three million bbl/d in 2008 to 6.9
million bbl/d in 2030. This compares with just 1% year-on-year global growth, since most Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD ) economies are expected to have declining oil demand
due to energy efficiency. India is likely to overtake Japan as the third largest oil and natural gas
consumer by 2020, while China will overtake the US as the world's largest consumer by 2025.

The ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN ) countries, many of which have seen rapid
economic growth over the past three decades, will also see strong growth in energy demand. IEA
estimates that total ASEAN demand is likely to increase from 3.5 million bbl/d in 2008 to 5.3 million bbl/d
by 2030, because of rapid GDP growth and current levels of low energy consumption per person. ASEAN
GDP is expected to rise by 4% annually from 2007 to 2015, and then by 3.7% a year from 2015 to 2030.
Non-OECD Asia will see average annual oil demand growth of 1.8% until 2030.

Asian Investors Continue to Focus on North America
Over the past six months, Asian equity capital continued to flow into private North American oil and gas
companies as it has over the past four years, with companies such as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp
(Sinopec) (SSE: 600028), Itochu Corp (TES: 8001), Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC), CNOOC, Mitsui &
Co (TSE: 8031), Marubeni Corp (TSE: 8002) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) (BSE: RIL) very active.
Investment targets ranged from Western Canada's oil sands and LNG complex to West Texas
unconventional shale assets and the Gulf of Mexico through participation in buyout consortia that provide
joint venture capital and preferred equity investment in corporations.

Through various asset bases, structures, returns and counterparties, investments are aimed at learning
leading edge onshore drilling techniques, establishing incumbency in attractive asset bases and achieving
strong returns.
Asian public institutional equity investors are following their private investment counterparts in looking at
North American oil and gas opportunities for attractive growth and returns. Asian institutions are
underweight in North American oil and gas, with investment totaling US$7.3 billion, 85% of it coming
from Japan. North American public equity holdings in upstream companies indicate that there are
opportunities to speed up investment in the sector.
Asian investors currently hold more than US$109 billion in oil and gas assets under management, and
their market depth is enough to attract potential shareholders. Japan is the second largest single-country
capital market in the world, with capital totaling US$22 trillion, and US$700 billion invested in foreign
equities, 44% of it in North America. Realizing the great potential of Asian investors, North American
companies have conducted non-deal road shows in Asia to educate institutional investors, with prioritized
stops in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul and Singapore.

Australian institutional investors are also beginning to look to companies in North America, where the LNG
industry is increasingly a supplier of choice to Asian markets. Globalization within the North America
industry has speeded up and companies are forming operational and financial partnerships with Asian
counterparts.

Market Outlook
A significant restriction on economic growth is the region's huge dependence on foreign oil and gas
imports. To reduce dependency and boost energy security, countries are seeking to satisfy as much
demand as possible from domestic sources, especially in China, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Thus, Asia is becoming an increasingly important region for oil and gas exploration and drilling. As the
sector is dominated by offshore production, its offshore capex is likely to grow significantly over the next
five years.

Asia-Pacific is likely to become the world's second largest gas market by 2015, but the market is
dominated by long-term contracts, in which the price of gas is linked to that of oil, that have helped keep
Asian gas prices much higher than those elsewhere.
Asia's rapid growth depends on the availability of LNG supplies to meet rising future energy needs, mainly
for new, cleaner electricity generation. Its rush for resources risks pushing oil and LNG prices higher and
strengthens producers in using energy for political and diplomatic advantage. The region's quest for more
secure oil and LNG supplies has driven it towards greater dependence on and engagement in key oil and
gas exporting regions, especially the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. The uncertain political situation
and unrest in the Middle East have concentrated the risks of supply disruption on the Asian oil market,

Page57of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.which is the primary destination of Middle East oil, while disruptions in the Persian Gulf would expose all
importers to price rather than physical risks.

Japan, once considered a mature and saturated market, has now become a resurgent market and will
remain the world's largest LNG importer for the next few years. Japan's rising LNG needs have begun to
intensify concerns among other Asian LNG buyers over energy security. These concerns will likely
continue for the next five years, until more supplies become available from major new projects. By 2020,
North American shale gas supplies could play a key role in meeting Asia's needs for supply diversification.

Country Profiles

Australia

Sector Overview
Over the past six months, Australia's oil production fell as consumption rose, in a continuing long-term
inverse trend that has remained ongoing over several years. The oil and gas industry contributes 58% of
Australia's primary energy and A$28 billion (US$25.9 billion) a year to the economy, with access to
energy resources essential to continuing economic growth. The industry is responsible for more than
A$0.30 (US$0.28) in every dollar of Australian private sector investment. While Australia has found gas
faster than it has produced it, as it has done for a quarter of a century, it only has a decade of known oil
resources remaining at current production rates.

The development of Australia's gas resources continued due to the rise in demand from Asia and the
ability to sell LNG to Asia at oil-linked prices. Nevertheless, Australia is the world's most expensive place
for offshore petroleum E&P, three times more expensive than the US Gulf Coast and a little costlier than
Norway. Despite that, it has benefited from a US$180 billion LNG investment boom with seven major
projects under construction.

These projects are 80% more capital intensive than those in operation, mainly due to labor costs being
double those of many of its competitors, even though productivity is lower. The industry is in danger of
missing out on another US$150 billion investment in new LNG projects due to high costs, although the
investment is needed for new projects to meet Asian and domestic demand. The LNG industry is likely to
dry up by 2017 if there are no additional projects.

The resources boom has provided successive Australian Governments with extra tax revenues for the
past decade. The May 2013 tax changes in the federal budget, which affect exploration costs, and new
capitalization rules, will negatively influence the industry's international competitiveness. They continue
the trend of fiscal and regulatory changes that have reduced investor confidence. The industry is currently
investing around A$200 billion (US$185.04 billion) over five years on new projects that will pay billions
every year to the Government and create more than 100,000 new jobs.

In July, the Economic Regulation Authority (ERA) warned that Western Australia's domestic gas
reservation policy inhibits the long-term development of the state's gas market. It believes that the costs
that the policy imposes on Western Australia's economy far outweigh any benefits that it is believed to
have. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) claimed the ERA had
demonstrated the Government's interference in the gas market deters investment and production.
Oil Sector
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates Australia's crude oil proved reserves at 1.433
billion barrels in 2014, the same level as 2013. Production levels fell by 13.9% from 2012 to 446.7
thousand bbl/d in 2013, while consumption picked up by 0.9% to 1,136.1 thousand bbl/d. Imports
increased by 2.2% from 2011 to 503.057 thousand bbl/d in 2012, while exports decreased by 3.9% to
261.333 thousand bbl/d.

Natural Gas Sector

The EIA estimates Australia's 2014 natural gas reserves at 43.037 Tcf, the same level as 2013. The
country produced 1,902 Bcf in 2012, up by 4.6% from a year earlier, and consumed 1,718 Bcf, an
increase of 28.3%. Imports in 2012 decreased by 22.6% from 2011 to 178 Bcf, and exports by 3.4% to
925 Bcf.

Gas production is growing, but generates less than 9% of the country's electricity, low by international
standards. Gas is an under-used resource with potential for further expansion as it is the cleanest
practical source of large-scale base load and peaking power for Australia, is cheaper than solar and wind
power, and does not depend on weather conditions or the time of day.

Santos (ASX : STO)
In first quarter 2014, Santos produced 12.2 million boe, up by 1% from a year earlier due to the start-up
of Fletcher Finucane in Carnarvon Basin, offshore of Western Australia in May 2013 offset by lower
Western Australia gas production. Sales volumes increased by 6% to 13.8 million boe from a year earlier,
but decreased by 12% from the previous quarter. Sales revenue rose by 28% to US$913 million, due to
higher third-party crude oil sales. Gas production of 8.7 million boe was 4% lower than a year earlier,
with higher Darwin LNG and Cooper Basin production offset by lower production from Carnarvon Basin
due to lower customer nominations.

Woodside Petroleum (ASX : WPL)
Woodside Petroleum 's production increased to 23 million boe in first quarter 2014, up by 5% from the
corresponding period in 2013, but down by 0.9% from the previous quarter. Sales volumes also increased,
by 6.9% from a year earlier to 23.2 million boe, but only rose by 0.9% from the previous quarter. The
increase in production and sales volumes was due to the restart of the Vincent FPSO, offshore Western
Australia in late 2013. Sales revenue increased by 15.9% to US$1,675 million from a year earlier and
increased by 1.6% from the previous quarter due to additional oil volumes sold and higher realized prices
for Pluto LNG volumes sold in the period. The average Brent price for the quarter was US$107.87 per
barrel, below the US$112.64 per barrel a year earlier.

Market Outlook
New plants are likely to boost Australia's LNG capacity from 24 million metric tonnes a year to more than
80 million metric tonnes by 2017, with most of the additional output designated for Asian markets. Many
sedimentary basins have seen little exploration, while many regions with hydrocarbons have not been
drilled to any significant extent.

The closure of Kurnell refinery at New South Wales, which will happen by the end of 2014, will result in
Australia sourcing only around half of its refined oil products domestically. The full closure of BP Plc 's
(LSE: BP ) Bulwer Island refinery, Brisbane in mid-2015 would result in Australia supplying only around
one third of its own petrol and diesel. The increasing reliance on oil imports is likely to benefit independent
trading houses.
China

Sector Overview
Over the past six months, China's economic growth has slowed and oil and petrochemical demand has
been weak, although demand for oil products continued to grow. The Government further improved the
pricing mechanism for oil products, adjusted natural gas prices and announced a premium pricing policy
for upgraded quality oil products.
China is the world's largest energy consumer and the second largest oil consumer behind the US. Its
economic development and prosperity depends on its access to natural resources of which it has few of
its own. China's 12th Five-Year-Plan sets aggressive targets for shale gas production of 0.6 Bcf per day
by 2015, with plans to scale-up production to between 5.8 and 9.6 Bcf per day by 2020. Between 1,200
and 1,500 wells need to be drilled to meet the target, but only 60 exploration wells have been drilled so
far.
China continued to focus on developing largely unexploited reserves in the western interior provinces and
offshore fields, since its large oil fields have matured, and production has peaked. It had speeded up its
exploration for oil and gas in deepwater areas in the South China Sea, which contains up to 30 billion
tonnes of oil and 16 trillion cubic meters of gas.
China continued to build pipelines to ship 440,000 barrels of crude and 12 billion cubic meters of natural
gas a day from the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar to Kunming, Yunan Province. The oil pipeline will be
800km long and the natural gas pipeline will extend further to meet the needs of cities such as Kunming,
Guizhou and Guangxi in southwestern China. This project is part of the country's efforts to improve
energy security as its economy continues to expand.
Oil Sector
EIA data shows China's crude oil proved reserves in 2014 rose by 2.8% from 2013 to 24.376 billion
barrels. Production in 2013 rose by 2% from 2012 to 4,459.4 thousand bbl/d, and consumption by 4.3%
from 2011 to 10,276.8 thousand bbl/d in 2012.

Page59of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In July, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) relocate its billion-dollar rig, HD 981 from the disputed
area off the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea to an area around the Qiongdongnan basin, closer to
Hainan Island, after the giant oil rig was deployed two months ago. During the exploration, the rig found
signs of oil and gas and the company planned to assess the data and decide on its next steps.
China had proved natural gas reserves of 155.382 Tcf in 2014, an increase of 10% from 2013, EIA data
shows. Production levels rose by 5% from 2011 to 3,811 Bcf in 2012, consumption by 12% to 5,181 Bcf
and imports by 32.8% to 1,471 Bcf while exports decreased by 10.6% to 101 Bcf. Domestic productions
could not match consumption, causing a big rise in imports.
China made a US$400 billion gas supply deal with Russia in May as part of a longer term strategy to
raise natural gas imports through pipeline and LNG. While China is also connected to pipeline corridors in
central Asia and Myanmar, it will take years to ramp up to their full potential.

Leading Companies
China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) (SSE: 600028)
Oil and gas production increased by 8.77% from a year earlier to 118.96 million boe, where crude oil
production increased by 8.76% to 89.37 million barrels and natural gas by 8.68% to 177.37 Bcf. The
construction of shale gas production capacity in Fuling, Sichuan achieved significant progress with 22
wells in operation in the pilot project in the first quarter.

57)
PetroChina , the nation's largest oil and gas producer, earned a net profit of RMB34,758 million
(US$5,648.18 million) in first quarter 2014, down by 5.3% from a year earlier, basic earnings per share
totaled RMB0.19 (US$0.03), and its operating income down by 2.1% to RMB528,947 million
(US$85,953.89 million). The company made significant progress in oil and gas E&P and achieved
steady output increases in the first quarter. Crude oil production increased by 0.3% from a year earlier to
231.7 million barrels and marketable natural gas by 6% to 789.7 Bcf. Adhering to the principles of
market-orientation and profitability, PetroChina optimized resource allocation and sought rigorously to
reduce losses and increase profitability in refining and chemicals. It also adjusted its marketing strategies
to boost sales and enhance profitability by focusing on quality and profitability.

Market Outlook
The EIA estimates that China will import about 75% of its crude oil by 2035, as demand is likely to grow
faster than domestic production. China's access to natural resources is an important requirement for
social stability and economic growth. China hopes that the semi-submersible CNOOC 981 rig, the first
independent deepwater drilling rig operated by a Chinese company, which began drilling in the second
quarter of 2012, will reduce its dependence on oil imports and help develop deepwater exploration
technologies and equipment. Further shale exploration will help to meet the growing domestic demand for
gas and reduce the country's dependence on imports.

India

Sector Overview
The oil and gas industry is one of the six main industries in India and plays an important role in the
economy. India being the world's fourth largest importer increasingly relies on imported LNG. It has a
network of 9,537 km of crude pipeline with a capacity of 138.3 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa).
IOCL has the longest crude pipeline network, 4,376 km, 45.9% of the national total, and has the longest
pipelines, the 1,870 km Salaya-Mathura-Paripat Pipeline and the 1,302 km Haldia-Barauni or
Paradip-Barauni Pipeline. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) (BSE: ONGC) has the largest
capacity, 65.5 mmtpa, or 47.4% of the national total, followed by OICL's 40.4 mmpta, or 29.2%.

On July 16, the Government has officially approved HPCL to set up its proposed refinery and
petrochemical complex in Barner district, Rajasthan. The refinery will have a crude processing capacity of
9 million tonnes per year and will be implemented by HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd (HRRL), a joint
venture of HPCL and other equity partners and would use crude produced locally and from elsewhere,
making it Rajasthan's first refinery and the country's first petrochemical plant designed to process
indigenous crude. The Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas estimated the project cost at
US$6.85 billion and construction time at 4 years.
Oil Sector

Page60of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.India had proved crude oil reserves of 5.654 billion barrels in 2014, up by 3.3% from a year earlier.
Production levels declined by 0.8% from 2012 to 982.2 thousand bbl/d in 2013, while consumption rose by
6.2% from 2011 to 3,621.8 thousand bbl/d in 2012.
Indian NOCs have purchased equity stakes in overseas oil and gas fields in South America, Africa and
the Caspian Sea region to obtain reserves and production capability. Nevertheless, most imports continue
to come from the Middle East, where Indian companies have little direct access to investment.

Natural Gas Sector

India's proved reserves of natural gas rose by 7.2% from 2013 to 46.968 Tcf in 2014. Production
decreased by 12.3% from 2011 to 1,504 Bcf in 2012 and consumption by 9.1% to 2,056 Bcf, while imports
increased by 3.1% to 597 Bcf, with no exports.

The country has a huge potential demand for natural gas, the penetration of which is much lower than the
global average. India wants to double the current 10% share of gas in its energy mix by 2020, and reduce
the consumption of expensive diesel and fuel oil. The finance head at LNG importer Petronet LNG Ltd
(NSE: PLNG), 50% owned by state-run firms, said that any increase in natural gas prices would help raise
the acceptability of imported LNG.

Leading Companies
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) (BSE: ONGC)
ONGC provides 72% of the country's total crude oil and 48% of natural gas production. For the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2014, it reported 10.9% higher profit after tax of Rs31,524 crore (US$5,201.46 million)
compared with a year earlier, and 14.1% higher revenue of Rs56,384 crore (US$9,303.36 million). Crude
oil production declined by 0.5% from a year earlier to 25.99 million metric tonnes and natural gas by
1.9% to 24.85 billion cubic meters.

ONGC's subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltd (ONGC Videsh) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU)
with Turkish Petroleum Co (TPAO) on the sidelines of World Petroleum Congress (WPC) 2014 at
Moscow. The MoU paves the way for joint co-operation between two NOCs in the hydrocarbon sector.
The MoU envisages two companies working together for E&P activities in Turkey, joint participation in
bidding for opportunities including exploration bid rounds in third countries and pursuit of hydrocarbon
area related research and development activities.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) (BSE: RIL)

RIL, the largest private sector enterprise in India, and one of the world's top ten producers of
petrochemical products, increased revenue by 8.1% from a year earlier to Rs4,01,302 crore
(US$66,214.83 million) in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, and net profit rose by 4.7% to Rs21,984
crore (US$3,627.36 million). Higher prices and increase in volumes accounted for 7.7% and 0.4% growth
in revenue respectively.
The company is set to restart its petrol-retail operations as diesel prices are likely to be de-regulated by
Diwali Festival in mid-October. The company had to close down its pumps in 2008 due to the differential
with the diesel prices of state-owned oil marketing companies and private retailers. About 1,100 pumps
are closed since 2008 and the company would start them first before setting up new pumps.

Market Outlook
India is likely to experience an energy deficit, importing 77% of its total domestic crude oil demand. The
gas deficit is likely to continue for the next six months, boosting LNG imports, while a large portion of
demand will remain unsatisfied due to price sensitivity among end users.
Although Indian oil and gas companies are likely to explore global investment opportunities in shale gas,
this is unlikely to have any impact on improving the gas deficit situation in the near future. India is likely to
become a net importer of natural gas in the next two years if the situation does not change, risking
over-dependence on other countries and giving it little bargaining power. The Petroleum Ministry expects
imports of LNG to surpass domestic production in fiscal 2015.

The Government calculates that without the price increase, the gas supply will be only half of India's
demand, which will rise from the present 286 million cubic meters a day to 466 million cubic meters in
2016 or 2017.

Indonesia

Sector Overview

Page61of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Indonesia is the world's third fastest growing economy, with its energy sector seen by the Government as
playing a key role in maintaining the country's development. Crude oil production has declined since
1998, as the largest oil fields have matured and no new comparable resources have been developed. The
Indonesian Petroleum Association (IPA) warned that oil and gas potential needs to be developed to drive
sustainable economic growth, and the country is focusing on securing energy sources for its domestic
market.

In February, PT Kreasindo Resources Indonesia (KRI) and Nakhle Barani Pardis Co (NBP) signed a MoU
to explore the feasibility of building a refinery designed to process heavy crude oil in either West Java
Province or Banten Province, Indonesia. Under the agreement, KRI will own 70% of the planned 300,000
bbl/d refinery, while NBP own the remaining 30% and act as the refinery's heavy crude supplier. The
companies estimated the refinery would require an investment of US$3 billion, which is based on an
initial capacity of 150,000 bbl/d.
Oil Sector
Indonesian crude oil proved reserves fell by 10.9% from 2013 to 3.591 billion barrels in 2014. Production
levels fell by 5% from a year earlier to 939.7 thousand bbl/d in 2013, while consumption increased by
3.6% from a year earlier to 1,590 thousand bbl/d. The remaining hydrocarbons in Indonesia are becoming
harder to extract as most are in remote spots that require lots of expensive new infrastructure and
technology, and state-owned Pertamina lacks the necessary expertise.

Natural Gas Sector

Indonesia's proved natural gas reserves fell by 3.7% from 2013 to 104.37 Tcf in 2014. Production levels
declined by 5.2% from 2011 to 3,087 Bcf in 2012 and exports by 10.4% to 1,230 Bcf, while consumption
increased by 0.7% to 1,329 Bcf, and there were no imports in 2011.

Three new gas fields developed by Chevron Indonesia Co - Bangka field, Gendalo and Gehem, all in East
Kalimantan - are likely to begin production in 2015, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Masela block in the
Arafura Sea, north of Australia, with total reserves of 171.316 billion cubic meters and a soon to be set up
floating LNG plant is expecting first production in 2016.

Leading Companies

PT Medco Energi Internasional Terbuka (JSX: MEDC)
Medco Energi's main activities are oil and gas exploration, development and production, power
generation and renewable fuels with operational areas in Indonesia, Cambodia, Oman, Yemen, Libya,
Tunisia and the US, including one liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plant and three power plants. In the first
quarter of 2014, operating revenue declined by 8.3% from a year earlier to US$201,979,262 and gross
profit by 3.1% to US$85,918,093.
The company through its subsidiary, PT Medco E&P Indonesia has shut down its oil production from
Meta and Lica oil wells in South Sumatera for to security reasons. The production was brought to a
standstill due to a road blocking incident by a group of people who disturbs crude oil transportation from
the oil wells to Matra oil gathering station in Musi Banyuasin, South Sumatera. The oil production from
both wells are approximately 1,000 bbl/d, 2% of Medco Energi total oil and gas production in Indonesia.
The wells belongs to the Government, with its 80% production owned by the Government.

PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG) (JSX: MEDC)
PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG) is an independent upstream oil and gas company with operations
ranging from Northern Sumatra to East Kalimantan, Java and Eastern Indonesia. Its net sales for the first
quarter of 2014 rose by 8.3% from a year earlier to US$193,843,392, operating income by 12% to
US$58,243,101, net income by 508.8% to US$17,793,588 and gross profit by 9.1% to US$62,429,614.
In July, the company's 60.49% owned and operated Malacca Strait PSC block commenced its first
commercial gas volume of 8.5 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day. The gas output is produced from the
block's Kuat gas field and is sold at US$8 per million British thermal unit (btu) with an escalation term of
3% per annum from July 2014 to August 2020.

Market Outlook
According to Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas Business Activities (SKK Migas ), Indonesia
will miss its 2014 liquids production target of 870,000 bbl/d set in the annual budget despite the additional
production of 13 new oil and gas projects. The new projects will have combined production capacity of

Page62of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.954,000 thousand cubic feet per day of gas and 194,121 bbl/d of oil and condensate, and are expected to
start production in 2014 with production of an average 803,800 bbl/d.

Japan

Sector Overview
Japan is the world's largest LNG importer, second largest coal importer and third largest net oil importer.
The country relies almost solely on imports to meet its oil consumption needs, as Japan's oil resources
are very limited. Japan's limited hydrocarbon reserves and its need to secure energy imports are the
reason the Government uses to support upstream Japanese companies in their quest to purchase
overseas oil and natural gas equity. Japan that is highly dependent on the Middle East for the majority of
its supply is seeking to diversify its supply sources in Russia, Southeast Asia and West Africa.

Restoration and reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake pushed the Japanese economy to
modest recovery over the past six months. All of Japan's nuclear power generation capacity was removed
from service in late 2013. Oil and natural gas replaced all of the lost nuclear generation in 2011 and 2012.
As nuclear capacity resumes operation following government approval of facilities, Japan expects to
reduce the current share of fossil fuel generation. Japan began producing natural gas from offshore
methane hydrates in March 2013, a major breakthrough with potentially explosive consequences for both
energy markets and efforts to deal with climate change. It is considered the world's first major
breakthrough in tapping a potentially massive alternative source of natural gas and could meet Japan's
needs for 100 years. The Government plans to develop technology to enable commercial use by 2018.
Oil Sector
Japan's crude oil proved reserves in 2014 were the same as in 2013, 0.044 billion barrels. Production
levels dropped by 0.1% from 2012 to 135.4 thousand bbl/d in 2013, and consumption by 3.5% to 4,563.1
thousand bbl/d, while imports increased by 2.7% from 2011 to 3,456.989 thousand bbl/d in 2012 and there
were no exports.

Japan has long seen a declining trend in domestic demand for petroleum products, and this continued
over the past six months due to more use of fuel-efficient vehicles and the progress of industrial
energy-saving measures. Nevertheless, the demand for petroleum products was at a similar level to that
of a year earlier because of increased demand for fuel oils for electric power stations resulting from the
suspension of nuclear power operations after Fukushima disaster.

Natural Gas Sector

Japan's 2014 proved reserves of natural gas were the same as in 2013, 0.738 Tcf. Production decreased
in 2012 by 2.9% from a year earlier to 169 Bcf, while consumption rose by 3.5% to 4,617 Bcf, imports by
4.4% to 4,295 Bcf, and there were no exports.

Although Japan is a large natural gas consumer, it has a relatively limited domestic natural gas pipeline
transmission system for a consumer of its size. The limited pipeline system is partly due to geographical
constraints posed by the country's mountainous terrain and the result of previous regulations that limit
investment in the sector. The nuclear plant shutdown after the Fukushima disaster forced Japan to import
more LNG for power utilities, causing short-term prices to shoot up on the spot market.

Leading Companies

JX Holdings (TSE: 5020)
The company's net income fell by 32.9% to Y107,042 million (US$1,006.19 million) in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2014; net sales rose by 10.6% to Y12,412,013 million (US$116,672.92 million),
operating income fell by 15% to Y213,657 million (US$2,008.38 million) and ordinary income by 7.9% to
Y302,329 million (US$2,841.89 million). The Vietnamese government approved its plan to develop the
Rand Dong oil field, offshore Vietnam using a technology that enhances the crude oil recovery rate by
injecting hydrocarbon gas into an oil reservoir, and approved a five-year extension of the production
sharing contract term in the block.

Idemitsu Kosan (TSE: 5019)
Its net sales rose 15.1% to Y5,034,995 million (US$47,328.95 million), while ordinary income fell 24.9%
to Y81,921 million (US$770.06 million). Operating income down by 29.4% to Y78,197 million
(US$735.05 million) due to increased crude oil costs following the depreciation of the Japanese yen was
partially offset by increased earnings from petrochemical products and the increase in the impact of
inventory valuation.

Page63of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Market Outlook
Japan's oil consumption is likely to remain static in the next six months. The Government is increasingly
cautious about the impact of high fuel costs on the economy, especially since the Fukushima disaster
forced utilities to return to thermal power generation. Japan is now trying to obtain shale gas from the US,
and hoping to negotiate a price cut from other resource-rich countries such as Russia, which is facing a
declining share of the European market.

South Korea

Sector Overview
South Korea is a major energy importer, mainly of oil, natural gas and coal. It is the world's fifth largest
crude oil importer and second largest LNG buyer. South Korea and Turkmenistan signed a US$4 billion
deal in June to construct natural gas processing plants in Turkmenistan. The state-owned Turkmengaz
together with LG International Corp (KSE: 1120) and Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (KSE:
720) will build the gas processing plants. Under the contract, South Korean firms would build a US$2.5
billion gas-to-liquids plants with an annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes and a US$1.5 billion plant to
produce 290,000 tonnes of polyvinyl chloride and 190,000 tonnes of hydrate a year.
Oil Sector
South Korea does not have its own oil reserves and imported 2,548.657 thousand bbl/d in 2012, an
increase of 1.3% from 2011. It consumed 2,305.4 thousand bbl/d in 2013, an increase of 0.2% from 2012.
Oil demand is likely to continue to drop up to 2019, due to more stringent energy efficiency standards and
a declining population. Oil companies have upgraded refining facilities and increased upstream
investment, and have begun investing in alternative energy projects.

Natural Gas Sector

South Korea's proved reserves of natural gas increased by 9.1% from 2013 to 0.203 Tcf in 2014.
Production increased by 2.8% from 2011 to 37 Bcf in 2012, consumption by 7.5% to 1,764 Bcf, imports by
2.3% to 1,688 Bcf, and there were no exports. In June, during the summit talks between South Korean
President Park Geun-hye and her Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov, both agreed to push for new joint
projects in gas development, and exchanged views on development of the Surgil gas field near the Aral
Sea and construction of a gas-chemical plant.

million), operating income by 85.6% to KRW46,938 million (US$46.94 million) and cash flow by 3% to

Market Outlook

As South Korea plans to boost production at its overseas fields to 35% of imports by 2020, to strengthen
energy security, the Government is introducing comprehensive measures to reduce oil consumption,
which greatly affects economic growth. The measures include boosting production of more fuel-efficient
cars, tax exemptions for buyers of hybrid cars and small vehicles, and increasing tax deductions by KRW1
million (US$9,000) for public transport users who make payments through credit or transportation cards.
The Government hopes that the measures will reduce oil consumption by 26 million barrels up to 2015,
and cut dependence on oil to 33% of all energy consumption in 2015, from the estimated 37.5% in 2012.
At the same time, South Korea has made the development of shale gas and electricity storage systems
the new economic growth engines, and is looking to tap overseas shale gas. The Ministry of Knowledge
Economy wants to expand imports of the new fossil fuel to 20% of all natural gas imports by 2020, hoping
that the development will reduce the price of LNG and the money spent on gas imports.
