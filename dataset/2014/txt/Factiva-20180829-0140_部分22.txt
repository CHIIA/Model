Think on-trend when buying for couples.

With March being Melbourne's busiest wedding season, it's the time of year those stiff white envelopes
filled with lavishly embossed invitations start arriving in our letterboxes. But with more and more couples
living together before they tie the knot, the tradition of present-giving is getting trickier - a set of steak
knives just isn't going to cut it any more.

However, some of the long-established gift staples, such as towels, crockery and tea sets, still make
perfectly wonderful gifts - but why not steer clear of the traditional white and china options and go for
something more on-trend. Melbourne brand Ziporah is creating luxe towels in vibrant colours, and artists
Rowena Martinich and Geoffrey Carran are producing exquisite one-off dinner plates and platters. Top of
the gift-registry for many couples will be the Tom Dixon Form tea set. Made from brass and bakelite, it's
undoubtedly a future heirloom.
If you're in a group of guests combining resources, how about splashing out on a piece of art? Consider
an original work from an up-and-coming local artist, or a fabulous vintage poster such as the French,
circa 1960, Transitradio poster from Galerie Montmartre in Fitzroy. Hanging in the newlyweds' home, it
will be appreciated every day, and will last a lot longer than any toaster.
