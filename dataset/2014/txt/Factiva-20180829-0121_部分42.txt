This three-storey residence includes a theatre and 12-car garage, writes Alice Coote
A GRAND Federation residence in Killara has sold for more than $9 million. The property at 45
Springdale Rd settled last week and, while the exact price wasn’t disclosed, it did sell for more than
$9 million – the highest sale price for the area in more than a year.

LJ Hooker St Ives agent Matthew Johnson said the vendor bought the property more than 10 years
ago and undertook significant renovations.

They transformed the single-level Federation home into three levels, taking the floor size from around
250sq m to 1150sq m.
The property was bought by a family from mainland China.
“It was over 3000sq m and had a double staircase, Art Deco style home theatre, garage for 12 cars
and a wine cellar,” Mr Johnson said.
STRONG RESULTS A WARRAWEE property has sold under the hammer for $2.27 million. No.33
Hastings Rd kicked off with an opening bid of $2 million. The exceptionally presented two-storey,
five-bedroom, renovated home with a pool was on the market for less than a month.

Burns and Burns, Pymble, director Andrew Burns said there were two serious bidders on the day.

“Seventy people attended the auction, with two serious bidders,” Mr Burns said. “We are very
pleased with the result.” There was strong competition at the auction of 69 Darnley St, Gordon. The
single-level, four-bedroom home sold for $1.575 million to a family.

“Eighty people attended the auction, with five keen bidders vying it out after an opening bid of $1.4
million,” Mr Burns said.
“Auctions have been exceptionally well attended recently, with strong bidding across the board.”
Both Gordon and Warrawee have enjoyed growth in the past 12 months. Warrawee’s median house
price is now $1.552 million, an increase of 6.3 per cent in the past year.
Gordon’s median house price is $1.5 million, an increase of 15.8 per cent in the same period.
SOLD PRIOR A HOUSE in Northbridge has sold before auction for $1.5 million. The property at 4
Tarakan Cres was sold last Friday to a buyer from Beijing, China.

McGrath Northbridge agents David Howe and Grant Borley showed 95 groups through the property
during the campaign and issued 15 contracts.

The vendors plan to upgrade in the same suburb.

starting bid of $1 million.

Rd, Lane Cove under the hammer for $462,500.

QUICK DECISION A BUYER who saw a Willoughby property for the first time just 20 minutes before
auction, beat other bidders to secure the home.
The four-bedroom home at 56 Sydney St was sold under the hammer for $2.5 million.
It was sold by John McManus and Joshua Soineva from LJ Hooker Willoughby.
KILLARA CHARMER a KILLARA property has sold for more than the asking price of more than $6
million.
There were four buyers interested in the home at 65 Arnold St which sold last Friday.
The seven-bedroom property was bought by expats living in Tokyo. It was sold by Brent Courtney
from McGrath Lane Cove and Jon Dundas-Smith from McGrath Lindfield.
KNOCK DOWN, REBUILD A HOUSE that was offered for the first time in almost 100 years has sold
for $1.91 million.
The property at 28 Bayswater Rd, Lindfield is set on 1239sq m with a 26.77m frontage.

LJ Hooker Lindfield agent Steve Hankins showed more than 200 people through during inspections
over the four-week campaign and issued 40 contracts.

knock down and rebuild.Find us on Facebook at News Realestate, or on Twitter @Syd_Real_Estate
