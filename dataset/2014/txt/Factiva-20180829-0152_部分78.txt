Our market lacks inspiration a few days into the New Year, with no dramatic moves anywhere and many
players still missing. Caution prevails, with the banks where p/es had risen too far being neglected, miners
down as China is slowing and growth in Europe and the US unlikely to have much impact on the sector -
and the outlook for emerging markets troubled.

"Support at 5315, resistance 5325 next at 5345, up 15 on the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500 is still in uptrend. Resistance now is at the
1840 mark and then the previous high which was 1850. It could test the previous high, however it is likely
to consolidate into the reporting season.

"The German Dax has quite a similar chart to the S&P500. There was a bit of profit taking last week, but it
is regaining its losses and is likely to re-test the highs. The European markets are looking firmly in tact.

"In Japan, the market is still in uptrend although they have had a couple of days of sell off. However it is
currently testing the 20 day moving average which has been good support, at 15,756 - worth keeping an
eye on 15,756- if that breaks it will be short term bearish for Japan.
"With regard to gold. $1250 is resistance - it had the first negative night last night. It is still a bit of a dead
cat bounce. Last night could be the first move down. Support is at $1218. A break of $1218 could see it
test $1200 again.

"To our market, we had another weak performance yesterday, closing on the lows. The chart after
recovering December losses looks like it is trending down. The RSI also indicates that.

"I expect support at yesterday's low of 5315. Resistance now should be 5325, next at 5340. Underlying
weakness in our market continues compared to the global market. Resources are likely to remain weak,
household names and leaders probably will provide support.

"For the day I will call us up 15 points".
