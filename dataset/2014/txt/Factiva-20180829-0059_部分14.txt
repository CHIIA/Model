16 May 2014 04:03 ET Goodman Fielder Endorses Wilmar, First Pacific Bid

By Ross Kelly

SYDNEY--Australian food producer Goodman Fielder Ltd. (GFF.AU) urged shareholders on Friday to
accept a sweetened takeover bid from Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. (F34.SG) and Hong
Kong's First Pacific Co. (0142.HK) that valued the company at around 1.37 billion Australian dollars
($1.28 billion).

The recommendation came after Wilmar and First Pacific gave Goodman Fielder directors 24 hours to
decide whether to endorse the offer, saying they would walk away after the deadline.

The fresh bid of 70 Australian cents a share, above an initial offer of 65 cents, "maximized value for
shareholders," Steve Gregg, Goodman Fielder's chairman, said in a statement.

Takeover interest in Australian food assets has surged in recent months, as bidders position
themselves for a rise in Asia's appetite for Western-style diets as the region's middle class grows more
affluent.

Goodman Fielder manufactures some of Australia's most recognizable food brands, including Meadow
Lea margarine, Praise mayonnaise and Wonder White bread. Wilmar has been touted as a potential
buyer ever since it took a 10% stake in Goodman Fielder two years ago.

The sweetened offer had already gained partial support from two key shareholders. Fund managers
Perpetual and Ellerston Capital said earlier Friday that they would sell part of their stakes to Wilmar
and First Pacific, raising the bidders' combined stake in the company to around 20%.
