An ageing residential block on the Pacific Highway in St Leonards has sold to a Chinese
family-run developer, for a price believed to be higher than $40 million.
The site at 617-621 Pacific Highway owned by Legacy Property occupied a land area of 1060
square metres with three street frontages, and carried two mixed-use DA comprising 11,912 square
metres over 17 storeys.

The site, sold on a vacant possession, is located within 100 metres of St Leonards Railway Station
and just six kilometres from Sydney's CBD.
Sources close to the deal said the property sold for around $40 million, but CBRE agents Matthew
Ramsay and Ben Wicks could not be drawn to comment.
Other sources in the area report that residential developers are buying ageing commercial sites in
the area, and pricing potential units at as much as $300,000 each.
The Chinese private developer who bought the property is said to be run by a father and son, who
plan to build an apartment project.
The sale comes as more residential developers flock to commercial hub that is within 10 minutes'
drive of Sydney's central business district. Listed group Mirvac had been running the ruler over a
3.7-hectare industrial asset in St Leonards with residential redevelopment potential, valued at
$150 million.
The site at 39 Herbert Street is part of a slab of properties owned by Altis Property Partners up for
sale. Mirvac is understood to be eyeing off several industrial properties in the portfolio, which carries
a total price tag of higher than $300 million, in addition to the Herbert Street asset.
Many commercial landlords in the area are said to be open to the idea of selling, given the
backdrop of softening rents in the area.

Rents in St Leonards have suffered as a wave of redevelopment and office upgrades has swept
North Sydney, and satellite business hubs including Macquarie Park and Norwest Business Park
have attracted tenants with new, attractively priced commercial space.
In February, Singaporean investment group Suntec paid more than $400 million for a commercial
site under development, which will soon become Leighton's new headquarters.
