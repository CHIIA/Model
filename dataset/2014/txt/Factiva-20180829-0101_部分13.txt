*Janet Yellen upbeat on economy, but signals rates will stay near zero

Fed Reserve chief Janet Yellen offered a mostly upbeat economic outlook in testimony to Congress but
signalled while many indicators suggest a rebound in spending and production is already under way,
putting the overall economy on track for solid growth in the current quarter, she also signalled that hasn't
altered the central bank's plan to keep short term interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.

*New hope for de-escalation of Ukraine situation

Russian President Vladimir Putin last night suggested the pro-Russian separatists postpone their
referendum on a secession from Ukraine. They have said they will meet to consider his request. He also
said he has withdrawn troops from on the Ukraine border to their regular bases (although NATO said it
has seen no evidence of this) and welcomed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's call for a round table of
all parties concerned, including the separatists.

*OECD retains 2.5% growth forecast for Australia in 2014, warns on budget cuts

*The OECD in its latest biannual economic outlook yesterday cut its forecasts for Australia's growth to 2.9
% for 2015, down from its forecast of 3.1 % six months ago.

The forecast of 2.5 % growth for Australia in 2014 was unchanged.

Page31of231©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The OECD says non-mining investment is still too weak to offset the slowdown in the mining sector, and
for this reason rapid and steep spending cuts will threaten the economic recovery.

"Given near-term uncertainties in the rebalancing of the economy away from investment in the natural
resource sector, heavy front-loading of fiscal consolidation should be avoided," the OECD said.

*AIO/GWR: AIO led YES Consortium chosen for expansion of Esperance Port

GWR Group Ltd welcomed the announcement made earlier today by Transport Minister Dean Nalder that
Yilgarn Esperance Solution Ltd (YES) has been named the preferred proponent to develop the Multi-User
Iron Ore Export Facility (MUIOF) proposed for Esperance Port, with the proposed expansion set to almost
double the port's iron ore export capacity to about 20 million tonnes per annum. The YES consortium
comprises McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd, Asciano Ltd and Marubeni Corporation Ltd.

GWR CEO Craig Ferrier said the establishment of the Esperance MUIOF will offer GWR the opportunity to
access a deep water port for the export of its high grade low impurity direct shipping iron ore. (May 7)

*KMD: Quotes consensus much higher 2014 NPAT f/casts at Macquarie Confce

Kathmandu CEO Peter Halkett and CIO Grant Taylor in their presentation to the Macquarie Conference
included current analysts consensus full year 2014 sales expectation for $NZ405.2 million, NPAT of
$NZ45.9 million vs $25.2 million for full year 2013 and EBIT of around $NZ68.7 million vs $NZ48.5
million in 2013. (May 7)

*NAB: National Australia Bank reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: #3.751 bln cash NPAT, up 0.1%, div 98c. (all but one analyst report sighted had full
year forecasts, not interim). .

As of May 02, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 31 investment analysts polled by the Financial
Times covering National Australia Bank Ltd. advises investors to hold their position in the company. This
has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts deteriorated on Apr 28, 2014.
The previous consensus forecast advised that National Australia Bank Ltd. would outperform the market.
There were 6 "buy" recommendations, 8 "out performs', 11 "holds', 3 "underperforms' and one 'sell".

*On May 2 a leading broker with an "underweight" on NAB and a price target of $32.50 said it has already
factored in a strong UK earnings recovery but it thinks the path to a UK exit is difficult. "At the same time,
we believe business banking revenue growth will disappoint, the era of positive cost surprises has ended
and NAB's retail bank momentum vs peers is slowing".

*On March 27 a leading broker with a "lighten" recommendation for NAB and a $35.19 price target said
concerns around a lack of revenue growth are likely to weigh, the composition of the 2013 result was
disappointing with no pre provision earnings growth.

*On March 12 a leading broker with an "outperform" on NAB and a $39.58 price target said NAB is the
only market with a capital return potential of 114/305 cents per share, or alternatively opt for buybacks,
due to its organic capital release options and inorganic options - a sale of assets in the UK and US would
see capital continue to strengthen by 73/181 bp.
