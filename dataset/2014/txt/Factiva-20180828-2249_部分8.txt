SUMMARY: We, NMFS, issue this final rule implementing our determination that the narrow sawfish
(Anoxypristis cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (Pristis clavata), largetooth sawfish (collectively Pristis pristis;
formerly Pristis pristis, Pristis microdon, and Pristis perotteti), green sawfish (Pristis zijsron), and the
non-U.S. distinct population segment (DPS) of smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) are endangered
species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. We also include a change in the
scientific name for largetooth sawfish in this final rule to codify the taxonomic reclassification of P. perotteti
to P. pristis. We are not designating critical habitat because the geographical areas occupied by the
species are entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction and we have not identified any unoccupied areas within U.S.
jurisdiction that are essential to the conservation of any of the five species.

We have reviewed the status of the five species of sawfish, considered public and peer review comments,
and conservation efforts being made to protect all five species, and we have made our determination
based on the best available scientific and commercial data that all five species of sawfish--the narrow
sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (Pristis clavata), largetooth sawfish (collectively Pristis
pristis; formerly Pristis pristis, Pristis microdon, and Pristis perotteti), green sawfish (Pristis zijsron), and
the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) --are at risk of extinction throughout all of their
ranges and should be listed as endangered species.

DATES: This final rule is effective January 12, 2015.

ADDRESSES: Information regarding this final rule may be obtained by contacting NMFS, Protected
Resources Division, 263 13th Avenue South, St. Petersburg, Florida, 33701. The final rule and citation list
are located on our Web site at http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/protected_resources/sawfish/index.html.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 10, 2010, we received a petition from the WildEarth
Guardians (WEG) requesting we list six sawfish species-- knifetooth, narrow, or pointed sawfish (A.
cuspidata), hereinafter the narrow sawfish; dwarf or Queensland sawfish (P. clavata), hereinafter the dwarf
sawfish; largetooth sawfish (P. pristis and P. microdon); green sawfish (P. zijsron); and the non-listed
population(s) of smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata)--as endangered or threatened under the ESA; or
alternatively, list any distinct population segments (DPS) that exist under the ESA. On March 7, 2011, we
published a 90-day finding (76 FR 12308) stating the petitioned action may be warranted for five of the six
species. The five species were A. cuspidata, P. clavata, P. microdon, P. zijsron, and the non-listed
population(s) of P. pectinata. Information in our records at the time indicated that P. pristis, as described in
the petition, was not a valid species. Our 90-day finding requested information to inform our decision, and
announced the initiation of status reviews for the five species. On June 4, 2013, we published a proposed
rule (78 FR 33300) to list A. cuspidata, P. clavata, P. pristis (formerly P. pristis, P. microdon, and P.
perotteti), P. zijsron, and the non-U.S. DPS of P. pectinata as endangered. We also included a change in
the scientific name for largetooth sawfish in the proposed rule to codify the taxonomic reclassification of P.
perotteti to P. pristis. The largetooth sawfish (P. perotteti) was already listed as endangered on July 12,
2011 (76 FR 40822), but this listing decision concerns the entire largetooth sawfish (P. pristis) species as

Page18of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.it is currently classified, which also includes the species formerly classified as P. perotteti and P. microdon.
We did not propose to designate critical habitat because the geographical areas occupied by the species
are entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction and we did not identify any unoccupied areas that are currently
essential to the conservation of any of these species. We solicited public and peer reviewer comments on
the proposed rule and also coordinated outreach on the proposed rule with the Department of State to
give notice to foreign nations where the species are believed to occur.

We are responsible for determining whether species are threatened or endangered under the ESA (16
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). To make this determination, we first consider whether a group of organisms
constitutes a "species" under the ESA, then whether the status of the species qualifies it for listing as
either threatened or endangered. Section 3 of the ESA defines a "species" as "any subspecies of fish or
wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which
interbreeds when mature." On February 7, 1996 (61 FR 4722), NMFS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS; collectively, the Services) adopted a policy identifying two elements that must be
considered when identifying a DPS: (1) The discreetness of the population segment in relation to the
remainder of the species (or subspecies) to which it belongs; and (2) the significance of the population
segment to the remainder of the species (or subspecies) to which it belongs. As stated in the DPS policy,
Congress expressed its expectation that the Services would exercise their authority with regard to the use
of DPSs sparingly and only when the biological evidence indicates such action is warranted.

Section 3 of the ESA defines an endangered species as "any species which is in danger of extinction
throughout all or a significant portion of its range" and a threatened species as one "which is likely to
become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its
range." Thus we interpret an "endangered species" to be one that is presently in danger of extinction. A
"threatened species," is not presently in danger of extinction, but is likely to become so in the foreseeable
future (that is, at a later time). In other words, the primary statutory difference between a threatened and
endangered species is the timing of when a species may be in danger of extinction-- either presently
(endangered) or in the foreseeable future (threatened).

Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA requires us to determine whether any species is endangered or threatened due
to any one or a combination of the following five factors: (A) The present or threatened destruction,
modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational,
scientific, or educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D)

[Page Number 73979]

the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its
continued existence. We are required to make listing determinations based solely on the best scientific
and commercial data available after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into
account efforts being made by any state or foreign nation to protect the species.

Accordingly, we have followed a stepwise approach in making our listing determinations for A. cuspidata,
P. clavata, P. pristis (formerly P. pristis, P. microdon, and P. perotteti), P. zijsron, and the non-U.S.DPS of
P. pectinata. For the non-U.S. DPS of P. pectinata that may qualify as a DPS, we considered biological
evidence, such as genetic information to determine if the population met the DPS policy criteria. Using the
best available information gathered during the status reviews, we completed an extinction risk assessment
using the general procedure of Wainwright and Kope (1999). We then assessed the threats affecting the
status of each species using the five factors identified in section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, and then assessed
public and peer reviewer comments.

Once we determined the threats, we assessed the efforts being made to protect each species to
determine if these conservation efforts were adequate to mitigate the existing threats and alter extinction
risk. We evaluated conservation efforts using the criteria outlined in the joint NMFS and U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS) Policy for Evaluating Conservation Efforts (PECE; 68 FR 15100; March 28,
2003) to determine the certainty of implementation and effectiveness for future conservation efforts not yet
fully implemented or effective. Finally, we re-assessed the extinction risk of each species after considering
the existing conservation efforts.

In order to conduct a comprehensive review, NMFS Southeast Region Protected Resources Division and
NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center staff members collaborated to identify the best available
information. Unlike some of our previous 12-month findings, we did not develop a separate status review
report. Instead, we presented all information available for these species in the proposed rule, and we
present that information again, as modified by public comment on the proposed rule, in this final rule. We
first discuss background information relative to all five species, and then we include descriptions of the
natural history specific to each species.

Sawfish General Species Description

Page19of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Sawfishes are a group of shark-like rays. Taxonomically, they are classified in the Family Pristidae
(sawfishes), Order Rajiformes (skates, rays, and sawfishes), subclass (Elasmobrancii), and Class
Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish). The overall body form of sawfishes is similar to sharks, but they are
flattened dorso-ventrally. Sawfishes are covered with dermal denticles (teeth-like scales) and possess
enlarged pectoral fins.

The most distinct characteristic of sawfishes is their large, flat, toothed rostrum or `saw' with large teeth on
each side. The rostral teeth are made from calcified tissue that is neither dentin nor enamel, though it is
more similar to the latter (Bradford, 1957). Rostral teeth develop inside sockets on the rostrum and are
held in place by strong fibers. Unlike sharks, sawfish rostral teeth are not replaced, although partially
broken teeth may continue to grow (Miller, 1974). For some species of sawfish, the number of rostral teeth
can vary by geographic region.

Sawfishes use their rostrum to locate, stun, and kill prey, generally small schooling fishes such as mullet,
herring, shad, and sardines (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1953). Breder (1952), in summarizing the literature
on observations of sawfish feeding behavior, noted that they attack fish by slashing sideways through
schools of fish, and then impale the fish on their rostral teeth. Prey are subsequently scraped off their
rostral teeth by rubbing the rostrum on the bottom and then ingesting the whole fish. Bigelow and
Schroeder (1953) also report that sawfish feed on crustaceans and other benthic species. Recent studies
indicate that sawfishes may use their toothed rostrum to sense their prey's electric fields (Wueringer et al.,
2011; 2012).

Sawfish species are distributed primarily in circumtropical shallow coastal waters that generally vary in
salinity. While sawfishes are commonly found in shallow water, adults are known to also inhabit deeper
waters (greater than 130 ft, 39.6 m). Some sawfishes are found in freshwater, with established
populations in major rivers and lakes of South America, Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The
physical characteristics of habitat, such as salinity and temperature, likely influence a sawfish's movement
patterns. Tides limit the physical habitat area available, which may explain movement into shallow water
areas during specific tidal cycles (Blaber et al., 1989).

Life history data on sawfishes are limited. Fertilization is internal by means of male claspers and
reproduction is ovoviviparous; females carry eggs with a yolk sac that nourishes developing young until
they hatch within the body. Sawfishes are born with a gelatinous substance around their rostral teeth to
protect the mother during birth (Last and Stevens, 1994; Rainboth, 1996; Compagno and Last, 1999; Raje
and Joshi, 2003; Field et al., 2009). It is thought that most sawfishes breed every two years and have a
gestation period of about four to five months (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1953; Thorson, 1976a). The number
of young in a litter varies by species, as does the age at sexual maturity.

Like most chondrichthyes, sawfishes occupy the mid- to upper-level of their food web. Smaller sawfishes,
including juveniles, may be preyed upon by larger sharks like the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas),
estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus), or alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). Sawfishes may use
their saw as a weapon for defense against these predators (Brewer et al., 1997; Wueringer et al., 2009).

Previously, seven valid species of sawfish were recognized worldwide (Compagno, 1999). Compagno and
Cook (1995) and Compagno (1999) identified these seven species of sawfish as A. cuspidata Latham
1794, P. microdon Latham 1794, P. perotteti Muller and Henle 1841, P. pristis Linnaeus 1758, P. clavata
Garman 1906, P. pectinata Latham 1794, and P. zijsron Bleeker 1851. Since then, the taxonomy,
delineation, and identification of these species have proven problematic (Oijen et al., 2007; Wiley et al.,
2008; Wueringer et al., 2009). Most recently, Faria et al. (2013) hypothesized that the taxonomic
uncertainty occurred due to several factors: many original species descriptions were abbreviated, few
holotypes are available for examination, reference material is not available for comparison in museum
collections, and it is difficult to obtain fresh specimens because of the infrequent captures of all sawfishes.
The majority of the confusion regarding taxonomic classification of Pristidae was related to the species P.
pristis. To resolve questions regarding the taxonomy of pristids, Faria et al. (2013) used historical
taxonomy, external morphology, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (NADH-2 loci) to conclude
that sawfishes have five species in two genera: P. pristis, P. clavata, P. pectinata, P. zijsron, and A.
cuspidata. We accept this proposed taxonomy as the best available science.

Natural History of the Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata)

Taxonomy and Morphology

The narrow sawfish was first described by Latham in 1794 as P. cuspidatus. It was later reclassified as
Anoxypristis due to morphological differences from Pristis that include its narrow rostral saw, which lacks
teeth on the first quarter of the saw closest to the head in adults, as well as the distinct shape of the lower

Page20of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.lobe of the caudal fin (Compagno et al., 2006a). In juveniles, the portion of the rostrum without teeth is
only about one-sixth of the saw length (Wueringer et al., 2009).

In addition, the narrow sawfish is characterized by dagger-shaped rostral teeth (Fowler, 1941; Blegvad
and Loppenthin, 1944; Compagno and Last, 1999; Faria et al., 2013). The narrow sawfish also has a
second pair of hollow cartilaginous tubes in its rostrum that are not present in other sawfishes. These
canals contain an additional connection to the ampullae of Lorenzini (special sensory receptors) located
on the underside of the rostrum (Wueringer et al., 2009).

Rostral tooth count varies for this species between 18 and 22 (Last and Stevens, 1994), 24 and 28
(Hussakof, 1912), and 27-32 (Miller, 1974). The total number of teeth has been found to vary by individual,
region, and sex. Some studies report males having fewer rostral teeth than females, while others report
the opposite (Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999). While total rostral tooth count is often
inconsistent among individuals or studies, the number of teeth an individual has is fixed during
development (Wueringer et al., 2009).

The pectoral fins of the narrow sawfish are narrow, short, and shark-like in shape. The first dorsal fin is
located posterior to the insertion of the pelvic fins (Compagno and Last, 1999). Within the jaw, there are
94 teeth on the upper jaw and 102 on the lower jaw (Taniuchi et al., 1991a). The eyes are large and very
close to the spiracles. Coloration is dark grey dorsally and whitish ventrally (Fowler, 1941; Compagno and
Last, 1999).

Narrow sawfish are the only sawfish having tricuspid (three-pointed) denticles (White and Moy-Thomas,
1941). These denticles first appear on sawfish at 25.6 to 28 in (65 to 71 cm) total length (TL), after they
are born. In general, the narrow sawfish is considered "naked" because denticle coverage in adults is
often sporadic and widely spaced, usually only covering the rostrum and anterior fin margins, making the
skin appear smooth (Fowler, 1941; Gloerfelt-Tarp and Kailola, 1984; Last and Stevens, 1994; Wueringer
et al., 2009). Narrow sawfish also have buccopharyngeal denticles (tooth-like structures) present in their
mouth. This species does not have tubercles or thorns on their skin (Deynat, 2005).

Habitat Use and Migration

The narrow sawfish is largely euryhaline and moves between estuarine and marine environments
(Gloerfelt-Tarp and Kailola, 1984; Last, 2002; Compagno, 2002b; Compagno et al., 2006a; Peverell,
2008). It is generally found in inshore waters in depths of less than 130 ft (39.6 m) with salinities between
25 and 35 parts per thousand (ppt), spending most of its time near the substrate or in the water column
over coastal flats (Compagno and Last, 1999; Last, 2002; Peverell, 2005; Peverell, 2008; Wueringer et al.,
2009). While Smith (1936) described it as a possible freshwater species, there are only a few reports from
freshwater (Taniuchi and Shimizu, 1991; Last and Compagno, 2002; Bonfil and Abdallah, 2004; Wueringer
et al., 2009). We are not aware of any fresh or salt water tolerance studies on the species (Compagno,
2002a; Compagno, 2002b) and conclude its habitat is euryhaline.

In studies conducted by Peverell (2008), the narrow sawfish in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, undergo
an ontogenetic shift in habitat. Larger individuals were commonly encountered offshore, while smaller
individuals were mostly found in inshore waters. Peverell (2008) also found females were more likely to be
offshore compared to males, at least during the months of the study (February to May). This suggests that
smaller narrow sawfish use the protection and prey abundance found in shallow, coastal waters (Dan et
al., 1994; Peverell, 2005; Peverell, 2008).

Age and Growth

Two studies have been conducted on age and growth of narrow sawfish. Field et al. (2009) compared
previously-aged vertebrae with aged rostral teeth and found a direct correlation up to age 6. After age 6,
an individual's age was often underestimated using tooth growth bands as the teeth become worn over
time (Field et al., 2009). Peverell (2008) then used aged vertebrae to develop more accurate growth
curves for both sexes. While the maximum observed age of narrow sawfish from vertebrae was 9 years,
the theoretical longevity was calculated at 27 years (Peverell, 2008). A 1-year-old animal has a saw length
of approximately 4.5 in (11.5 cm). Female narrow sawfish begin to mature at 8 ft 1 in (246 cm) TL and all
are mature at 15 ft 5 in (470 cm) TL; males are mature at 8 ft (245 cm) TL (Pogonoski et al., 2002; Bonfil
and Abdallah 2004; Peverell, 2005; 2008). The maximum recorded length of a narrow sawfish is 15 ft 5 in
(4.7 m) TL, with unconfirmed records of 20 ft (6.1 m) TL (Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last,
1999; Pogonoski et al., 2002; Bonfil and Abdallah, 2004; Faria et al., 2013).

Reproduction

The narrow sawfish gives birth to a maximum of 23 pups in the spring. The total length (TL) of pups at
birth is between 17-24 in (43-61 cm) (Compagno and Last, 1999; Peverell, 2005; 2008). The reproductive
cycle is assumed to be annual, with an average of 12 pups per litter (Peverell, 2005; D'Anastasi, 2010).

Page21of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The number of pups is related to female body size, as smaller females produce fewer offspring than larger
females (Compagno and Last, 1999). Preliminary genetic research suggests that the narrow sawfish may
not have multiple fathers per litter (D'Anastasi, 2010).

Mating season may vary by geographic region. Female narrow sawfish captured in August (dry season) in
the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, all contained large eggs indicating they were mature (Peverell, 2005).
Mature males were also captured in similar locations during the same time of year (McDavitt, 2006).
Although animals are sexually mature in the dry season, mating may not occur until the rainy season in
March-May in the Indo-West Pacific (Raje and Joshi, 2003).

Age at maturity for narrow sawfish is 2 years for males and 3 years for females (Peverell, 2008). The
intrinsic rate of population increase (rate of growth of the population) based on life history data from the
exploited population in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, has been estimated at 0.27 per year (Moreno
Iturria, 2012), with a potential population doubling time of 2.6 years.

Diet and Feeding

Narrow sawfish feed on small fish and cuttlefish (Compagno and Last, 1999; Field et al., 2009) and likely
on crustaceans, polychaetes, and amphipods (Raje and Joshi, 2003).

Population Structure

Genetic and morphological data support the division of the global species of narrow sawfish into
populations. Based on gene sequence data, there is a very low level of gene flow between the northern
Indian Ocean (n = 2) and west Pacific (n = 11)

[Page Number 73981]

populations. Four haplotypes (combinations of deoxyribonucleic acid sequences or DNA) were identified:
northern Indian Ocean; Indonesian; New Guinean- Australian; and one specimen that lacked locality
information, but had a northern Indian Ocean haplotype. Specimens collected from the Indian Ocean had
a higher number of rostral teeth per side than those collected from the western Pacific (Faria et al., 2013).

Field et al. (2009) examined the primary chemical elements of rostral teeth (i.e., oxygen, calcium, and
phosphorous) from narrow sawfish captured throughout Australia in an attempt to separate subpopulations
based on the isotopes of these chemicals. They found distinctions between regions indicating two
separate subpopulations within the Gulf of Carpentaria Australia: one in the west (Northern Territory) and
one in the east (Queensland). Using isotopes to separate elasmobranch subpopulations is in its infancy,
however, and, coupled with the limited number of samples, it is not clear whether these results agree with
the above genetic studies of population structure. Isotopic signatures indicate the location where an
animal spends most of its time and identifies its major prey resources and do not necessarily provide
information on reproductive connectivity between regions. Therefore, we conclude that the best available
information on isotopic signatures does not support separating narrow sawfish into subpopulations.

Distribution and Abundance

The narrow sawfish is found throughout the eastern and western portions of the Indian Ocean as well as
much of the western Pacific Ocean. The range once extended from as far west as the Red Sea in Egypt
and Somalia (M. McDavitt, National Legal Research Group, Inc. pers. comm. to IUCN, London, 2012) to
as far north as Honshu, Japan, including India, Sri Lanka, and China (Blaber et al., 1994; Last and
Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999; Compagno et al., 2006a; Van Oijen et al., 2007). The species
has also been recorded in rivers in India, Burma, Malaysia, and Thailand (Compagno, 2002b).

While uncertain, the current status of narrow sawfish populations across its range has declined
substantially from historic levels. The species was previously commonly reported throughout its range, but
it is now becoming rare in catches by both commercial and recreational fishers (Brewer et al., 2006;
Compagno et al., 2006a). To evaluate the current and historic distribution and abundance of the narrow
sawfish, we conducted an extensive search of peer- reviewed publications and technical reports,
newspaper, and magazine articles. We also reviewed records from the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility (GBIF) database (www.gbif.org). The results of that search are summarized by major geographic
region.

Indian Ocean

The earliest reports of narrow sawfish in the Indian Ocean were from 1937 and 1938. Two sawfish were
captured from the northern Indian Ocean (no specific location was reported). A third specimen was later
caught in the same area (Blegvad and Loppenthin, 1944).

Page22of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.From areas in the western Indian Ocean around the Arabian Sea, three rostra were collected in 1938: Two
near Bushire, Iran, presumably from the Gulf of Oman, and a third in Jask, Iran, also adjacent to the Gulf
of Oman (Blegvad and Loppenthin, 1944). The most extensive report was 13 rostra from the Persian Gulf
(one of those was from Iran) but it did not include date information. Four juveniles were recorded in
Pakistan waters in 1975: Two females and two males (Faria et al., 2013). The last published record of
narrow sawfish from the western edge of the range, in the Straits of Hormuz, was in 1997 (A. Moore, RSK
Environment Ltd., pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012).

Most records of narrow sawfish in the Indian Ocean are from the Bay of Bengal. In 1960 and 1961, 118
sawfish, mostly narrow sawfish, were captured during fishery surveys using gillnets and long lines (James,
1973). There are several additional records of rostra from Bangladesh in the 1960s (Faria et al., 2013).
One record from the California Academy of Sciences is from a fish market in Bangkok, Thailand in 1961. A
narrow sawfish was used for a 1969 parasitological study in Bangladesh, but no further information was
recorded (Moravec et al., 2006). Faria et al. (2013) also reported one specimen from 1976, as well as 11
more records off India, but no dates were recorded. Narrow sawfish were recorded from the Kirachi West
Wharf Fish Market in Pakistan in 1978 (GBIF Database). From 1982 to 1994, one juvenile female, one
juvenile male, and three rostra were recorded in Pondicherry, India (Deynat, 2005). Two female neonate
specimens were recorded in Sri Lanka, and three juveniles (two males and one female) from Malabar in
Southwest India were also reported from 1982-1994 (Deynat, 2005). Between 1981 and 2000, in the Bay
of Bengal, total elasmobranch landings records are dominated by rays and include narrow sawfish (Raje
and Joshi, 2003). Landings of narrow sawfish are currently reported from the Indian Ocean off India
although they are infrequent (K.K. Bineesh, Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Department of Pelagic
Fisheries, India, pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012).

Indo-Pacific Ocean (excluding Australia)

There are several accounts of narrow sawfish over time from various unspecified locations throughout the
Indo-Pacific. One narrow sawfish specimen was recorded from Mabe, India in 1835, making it the oldest
museum record from the region (GBIF Database). The first records of narrow sawfish were for juvenile
males in 1852 and 1854 (Faria et al., 2013). A female and male were recorded in 1867, but no exact
location was specified (Faria et al., 2013). In 1879, one male and one female were also recorded from
Indonesia and four rostra were reported from China in 1898 (Faria et al., 2013).

The next reports of narrow sawfish from the Indo-Pacific occurred in the 1930s. A female was reported in
1931 in Indonesia (no specific location), and a male was reported in Singapore in 1937 (Blegvad and
Loppenthin, 1944). A narrow sawfish was caught in the Gulf of Thailand in March 1937 (Blegvad and
Loppenthin, 1944). A single report from Papua New Guinea was recorded in 1938 (Faria et al., 2013). In
1945, narrow sawfish were reported in the Chao Phraya River, Thailand and its tributaries (Smith, 1945).
In 1952, two females were captured from Batavia, Semarang, Indonesia along with a third female without
a rostrum (Van Oijen et al., 2007).

Records of narrow sawfish throughout the Indo-Pacific were scattered and infrequent throughout the
1950s. Faria et al. (2013) recorded rostra from Papua New Guinea; two from 1955 and one each from
1966, 1980, and 2000. A male was caught in 1989 from the Oriomo River, Papua New Guinea (Taniuchi
et al., 1991b; Taniuchi and Shimizu, 1991; Taniuchi, 2002). There are other reports of narrow sawfish from
Papua New Guinea around the Gulf of Papua and in Bootless Bay from the 1970s, but there are no recent
records (Taniuchi et al., 1991b). In a comprehensive literature search for the period 1923 to 1996 on the
biodiversity of elasmobranchs in the South China Sea, Compagno (2002a) found no records of sawfishes.
Yet, fresh dorsal and caudal fins of narrow sawfish were found during a survey of fish markets from 1996
to 1997 in Thailand (Manjaji, 2002b).

There are even fewer records of narrow sawfish from the Indo-Pacific over the last few decades. The only
known specimen in the twenty-first century is a single report from New Guinea in 2001 (L. Harrison, IUCN,
pers. comm. to John Carlson, NMFS, 2012).

Australia

Australia may have larger populations of narrow sawfish than any other area within the species' range
(Peverell, 2005). According to the GBIF Database for Australia flora and fauna, the first museum record of
the narrow sawfish in Australia is from the Australia Museum in Townsville, Queensland in 1963. This
database also lists observations of narrow sawfish throughout the 1980s, mostly recorded by the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Marine and Atmospheric
Research group. One individual was observed in Western Australia in 1982 and in 1983. In 1984, CSIRO
observed one narrow sawfish just west of Darwin, Northern Territory, and five in the Gulf of Carpentaria
(three in the east and two in the northwest). Five additional records in 1984 were from the northwest tip of

Page23of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.the western Gulf of Carpentaria, one from outside the Daly River, and three outside of Kakadu National
Park. In 1985, two narrow sawfish were observed near Marchinbar Island, Northern Territory. In the
eastern Gulf of Carpentaria, four narrow sawfish were observed in 1986, with single observations in 1987
and 1988. In 1988, a narrow sawfish was observed in Western Australia. Two narrow sawfish were
reported from the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1990 (Blaber et al., 1994). Single specimens were captured in
1991 from the west coast of Australia (Alexander, 1991), the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1995 (Brewer et al.,
1997), and the Arafura Sea in 1999 (Beveridge et al., 2005). Faria et al. (2013) reported three rostra
records from private collections in Australia from 1998-1999, but no other information on the collection
location was reported.

Narrow sawfish have been reported in multiple studies between 2000 and 2011, mostly from northern
Australia. In a bycatch reduction device study conducted in 2001 in the Gulf of Carpentaria, 25 narrow
sawfish were captured in trawling gear (Brewer et al., 2006). Later in 2001, a bycatch reduction device
study conducted in the Queensland shallow-water eastern king prawn (Penaeus plebejus) trawl fishery did
not capture a single specimen (Courtney et al., 2006). The European Molecular Biology Lab recorded
narrow sawfish in 2003 in the Northern Territory (GBIF database). A review of fisheries data and records
from 2000 to 2002, identified 74 offshore and 37 inshore records of narrow sawfish in the Gulf of
Carpentaria (Peverell, 2005). Between April 2004 and April 2005, 16 narrow sawfish were caught in the
Gulf of Carpentaria during a trawl bycatch study; the mean catch rate was 0.16 sawfish per hour (Dell et
al., 2009). Observers on commercial fishing boats recorded nine captures of narrow sawfish in 2007
within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Queensland, which accounted for 0.86 percent of the
shark and ray catch in the commercial fisheries (Williams, 2007). Observers in the Northern Territory's
Offshore Net and Line Fishery encountered several narrow sawfish from 2007 to 2010 (Davies, 2010).
Data from the Kimberley (R. McAuley, Department of Fisheries, Western Australia, pers. comm. to Colin
Simpfendorfer, 2012), the Northern Territory (Field et al., 2009), the Gulf of Carpentaria (Peverell, 2005),
and parts of the Queensland east coast (Harry et al., 2011) suggest viable subpopulations may remain
locally, but at significantly lower levels compared to historic levels.

In summary, it appears the current range of narrow sawfish is restricted largely to Australia. Narrow
sawfish are considered very rare in many places where evidence is available, including parts of India
(Roy, 2010), Bangladesh (Roy, 2010), Burma (FIRMS, 2007-2012), Malaysia (including Borneo; Almada-
Villela, 2002; Manjaji, 2002), Indonesia (White and Kyne, 2010), Thailand (CITES, 2007; Compagno,
2002a; Vidthayanon, 2002), and Singapore (CITES, 2007). In Australia, narrow sawfish are primarily
located in the north. The most recent museum record for narrow sawfish in southern Australia was from
New South Wales in the 1970s (Pogonoski et al., 2002). Data from the Queensland Shark Control
Program, conducted along the east coast of Queensland, from 1969 to 2003 show a clear decline in
sawfish catch (although not species-specific) with the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern
regions of Queensland by 1993 (Stevens et al., 2005). Although we cannot rule out underreporting of
narrow sawfish, especially in remote areas of its historic range, we conclude from the consistent lack of
records that narrow sawfish have been severely depleted in numbers and their range has contracted.

Natural History of Dwarf Sawfish (Pristis clavata)

Taxonomy and Morphology

Due to its size and the geographic location where it was described, P. clavata is referred to as the dwarf or
the Queensland sawfish. The species was first described by Garman in 1906; however, it has often been
confused with largetooth sawfish (Last and Stevens, 1994; Cook et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2010a). This
species can be distinguished from largetooth sawfish based on rostral tooth morphology (Thorburn et al.,
2007).

The dwarf sawfish is olive brown in color dorsally with a white underside. The rostrum of this species is
quite short, with 19 to 23 rostral teeth that are moderately flattened, elongated, and peg-like. Studies
indicate that this species does not display significant differences in the number of rostral teeth between
males (19 to 23 teeth) and females (20 to 23 teeth) (Ishihara et al., 1991a; Thorburn et al., 2008; Morgan
et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011). The rostrum makes up 21 to 26 percent of the total length of the dwarf
sawfish (Blaber et al., 1989; Grant, 1991; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999; Larson et
al., 2006; Wueringer et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2011).

Morphologically, the origin of the first dorsal fin is slightly posterior to the insertion of the pelvic fins, and
the second dorsal fin is smaller than the first. The pectoral fins are small compared to other sawfish
species, and are "poorly developed" (Ishihara et al., 1991a). There is no lower lobe on the caudal fin.
Lateral and low keels are present along the base of the tail (Compagno and Last, 1999; Wueringer et al.,
2009; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011). Within the mouth are 82-84 tooth rows on the upper jaw.
The total vertebrae number is 225-231. The dwarf sawfish has regularly overlapping monocuspidate
denticles on its skin. As a result, there are no keels or furrows formed on the skin (Fowler, 1941; Last and
Stevens, 1994; Deynat, 2005).

Page24of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Habitat Use and Migration

The dwarf sawfish has been found along tropical coasts in marine and estuarine waters, mostly from
northern Australia; it may inhabit similar habitats in other areas. Dwarf sawfish are reported on mudflats in
water 6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in (2 to 3 m) deep that is often turbid and influenced heavily by tides. Thorburn et
al. (2008) reported dwarf sawfish occur in waters 2 to 22 ft (0.7 to 7 m) deep, while Stevens et al. (2008)
recorded a maximum depth of 65 ft (20 m). This species has also been reported in rivers (Last and
Stevens, 1994; Wueringer et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010a) and as commonly occurring in both brackish
and freshwater, and in both marine and estuarine habitats (Rainboth, 1996; Thorburn et al., 2008).

[Page Number 73983]

For example, two dwarf sawfish were found 31 miles (50 km) upstream from the mouth of the south
Alligator River, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia in 2013 at salinities of 0.12 and 7.64
ppt (P. Kyne, Charles Darwin University, pers. comm. to S. Norton, NMFS, June 2013).

Juvenile dwarf sawfish may use the estuaries associated with the Fitzroy River, Australia as nursery
habitat for up to three years (Thorburn et al., 2008). Dwarf sawfish are also known to use the Gulf of
Carpentaria, Australia as nursery area in a variety of habitats (Gorham, 2006). However, physical
characteristics such as salinity, temperature, and turbidity may limit seasonal movements (Blaber et al.,
1989).

Age and Growth

Dwarf sawfish are considered to be small compared to other sawfishes. Their maximum size has been
reported as 4 ft 11 in (1.5 m) total length (TL) (Grant, 1991) and 4 ft 7 in (140 cm) TL (Last and Stevens,
1994; Rainboth, 1996; Compagno and Last, 1999). But more recently, much larger sizes have been
reported, as high as 19.7 ft (6000 cm) TL (Peverell, 2005). Specimens from Western Australia in 2008
indicate that females reach at least 10 ft 2 in (310 cm) TL (Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011).

Thorburn et al. (2008) and Peverell (2008) estimated age and growth for this species based on the
number of vertebral rings and total length. The average growth estimates for dwarf sawfish are 16.1 in
(41cm) TL in the first year, slowing to 9.4 in (24 cm) in the second year (Peverell 2008). Thorburn et al.
(2008) determined that animals close to 3 ft (90 cm) TL were age 1, those between 3.5 and 4 ft (110 cm
and 120 cm) TL were age 2, and those around 5 ft (160 cm) TL were age 6. Peverell (2008) reported
dwarf sawfish between 2 ft 11 in and 3 ft 3 in (90 and 98 cm) TL were age 0, those between 3 ft 7 in and 5
ft 9 in (110 to 175 cm) TL were considered 1 to 3 years old, and those between 6 ft 7 in and 8 ft (201 to
244 cm) TL were considered 4 to 6 years old (Peverell, 2008). Any dwarf sawfish over 9 ft 10 in (300 cm)
TL is considered to be at least 9 years old (Morgan et al., 2010a). The theoretical maximum age
calculated from von Bertalanffy parameters for dwarf sawfish is 94 years (Peverell, 2008).

Reproduction

There is little information available regarding the time or location of dwarf sawfish mating. It is
hypothesized that dwarf sawfish move into estuarine or fresh waters to breed during the wet season
(Larson et al., 2006), although no information on pupping habitat, gestation period, or litter size has been
recorded (Morgan et al., 2010a).

Dwarf sawfish are born between 2 ft 2 in and 2 ft 8 in (65 cm and 81 cm) TL (Morgan et al., 2010a;
Morgan et al., 2011). Males become sexually mature between 9 ft 8 in and 10 ft (295 and 306 cm) TL with
fully calcified claspers, though they may mature at smaller sizes, around 8 ft 5 in (255-260 cm) TL
(Peverell, 2005; Thorburn et al., 2008; Last and Stevens, 2009; Morgan et al., 2011). All males captured
by Thorburn et al. (2008) less than 7 ft 5 in (226 cm) TL were immature; two females, both smaller than 3
ft 11 in (120 cm) TL, were also immature. There is little specific information about sexual maturation of
females; females are considered immature at 6 ft 11 in (210 cm) TL (Peverell, 2005; Peverell, 2008;
Morgan et al., 2010a). Wueringer et al. (2009) indicates that neither males nor females are mature before
7 ft 8 in (233 cm) TL.

Intrinsic rates of population increase, based on life history data from Peverell (2008), has been estimated
to be about 0.10 per year (Moreno Iturria, 2012), with a potential population doubling time of 7.2 years.

Diet and Feeding

Dwarf sawfish, like other sawfishes, use their saw to stun small schooling fishes. They may also use the
saw for rooting in the mud and sand for crustaceans and mollusks (Breder Jr., 1952; Raje and Joshi,
2003; Larson et al., 2006; Last and Stevens, 2009). In Western Australia, the dwarf sawfish eats shrimp
(Natantia spp.), mullet (Mugilidae), herring (Clupeidae), and croaker (Sciaenidae) (Thorburn et al., 2008;
Morgan et al., 2010a).

Page25of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Population Structure

Phillips et al. (2011) conducted a genetic study looking at mtDNA of dwarf sawfish and found no distinct
difference in dwarf sawfish from Western Australia and those from the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern
Australia. The genetic diversity of this species was moderate overall; however, dwarf sawfish from the Gulf
of Carpentaria may have a lower genetic diversity than those of the west coast, possibly due to either a
small sample size or a reduction in abundance (Phillips et al., 2008). Further declines in abundance as
well as genetic drift may result in reduced genetic diversity (Morgan et al., 2010a; 2011).

Phillips et al. (2011) determined the populations of the dwarf sawfish are organized matrilineally (from
mother to daughter), indicating the possibility that females are philopatric (return to their birth place). While
the genetic diversity of this species is considered low to moderate across Australia, haplotype diversity in
the Gulf of Carpentaria was very low, but was greater in the west compared to the east. Low diversity
among and within groups of dwarf sawfish may be detrimental (Phillips et al., 2011).

Distribution and Abundance

Dwarf sawfish are thought to historically occur in the Indo-Pacific, western Pacific, and eastern Indian
Oceans, with the population largely occurring in northern Australia (Last and Stevens, 1994; Last and
Compagno, 2002; Compagno, 2002a; Compagno, 2002b; Thorburn et al., 2008; Wueringer et al., 2009;
Morgan et a l., 2010a; Kyne et al., 2013). While dwarf sawfish may have been historically more
widespread throughout the Indo-West Pacific (Compagno and Last, 1999; Last and Stevens, 2009), there
are questions regarding records outside of Australian waters (DSEWPaC 2011; Kyne et al., 2013; GBIF
database).

In an effort to gather more information on the species' historic and current range and abundance, we
conducted an extensive search of peer-reviewed publications and technical reports, newspaper, and
magazine articles. We also reviewed records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
Database (www.gbif.com). A summary of those findings is presented by major geographic region.

Indian Ocean

Dwarf sawfish are considered extremely rare in the Indian Ocean and there are few records indicating its
current presence (Last, 2002). Faria et al. (2013) report a female from the Reunion Islands, a female from
an unidentified location in the Indian Ocean, and a museum record of a male from Bay of Bengal, India. A
sawfish was landed at a port in Arabian Peninsula (presumably caught in the Gulf of Oman or the Arabian
Gulf) in January of 2006. It may have been a dwarf sawfish, but identification could not be confirmed
(Kyne et al., 2013). There are no reports of dwarf sawfish from Sri Lanka in more than a decade, although
they have been assumed to occur there (Last, 2002).

Indo-Pacific (excluding Australia)

Dwarf sawfish are considered very rare in Indonesia, with only a few records (Last, 2002). Faria et al.
(2013) compiled most reports of dwarf sawfish in Indonesia; since the first record in 1894 from Borneo,
there have been two

[Page Number 73984]

rostral saws in 1910 and five other rostra without date or length information. There is also one museum
record of a dwarf sawfish from Papua New Guinea in 1828 (Kyne et al., 2013).

Although reported historically, dwarf sawfish have not been found in any other areas in the Indo-Pacific in
over a decade. Rainboth's (1996) guide to fishes of the Mekong reported a dwarf sawfish from the Mekong
River Basin, Laos, in the early 1900s but no specimen exists to confirm this report. No sawfish of any
species, including the dwarf sawfish, were reported from the South China Sea from 1923-1996
(Compagno, 2002a). Faria et al. (2013) reported on two specimens from the Pacific Ocean, but no
specifics were provided.

Australia

The northern coast of Australia represents the geographic center of dwarf sawfish range that extends from
Cape York, Queensland west to the Pilbara area in Western Australia (Compagno and Last, 1999; Last
and Stevens, 2009; Kyne et al., 2013). Dwarf sawfish may have occurred as far south as Cairns, but
reports are lacking. Most records for dwarf sawfish are from the north and northwest areas of Australia.

The earliest record of dwarf sawfish in Australia is from 1877, but no specific location was recorded (Faria
et al., 2013). A single rostrum from a dwarf sawfish was found in 1916, but no other information was
recorded. In 1945, a single specimen was reported from the Northern Territory, Australia (Stevens et al.,

Page26of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.2005). There is a single record of a dwarf sawfish from the Victoria River in 1964 that is currently housed
at the Museum Victoria (GBIF Database).

Five female and five male dwarf sawfish (32 to 55 in; 82 to 140 cm TL) were captured in 1990 in the
Pentecost River using gillnets (Taniuchi and Shimizu, 1991; Taniuchi, 2002). CSIRO recorded five dwarf
sawfish in Western Australia in 1990 (GBIF Database). CSIRO also found one dwarf sawfish in Walker
Creek (a tributary of the Gulf of Carpentaria) in 1991 (GBIF Database). In 1992, one specimen was found
near Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia (GBIF Database). Between 1994 and 2010, almost 75 tissue
samples were taken from live dwarf sawfish or dried rostra from the Gulf of Carpentaria and the northwest
coast of Australia (Phillips et al., 2011). In 1997, two specimens were collected near the mouth of Buffalo
Creek in Darwin, Northern Territory (Chisholm and Whittington, 2000). In 2005, Naylor et al. (2005)
collected one dwarf sawfish from Darwin, Australia. One dwarf sawfish was captured in 1998 in the upper
reaches of the Keep River Estuary (Larson, 1999; Gunn et al., 2010). CSIRO reported one dwarf sawfish
in Western Australia (GBIF Database). In 2006, the European Molecular Biology Lab reported the
occurrence of three dwarf sawfish in Western Australia (GBIF Database). One interaction was reported
between 2007 and 2010 by observers in the Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery (Davies,
2010). A single specimen from Queensland (northeastern Australia) is preserved at the Harvard Museum
of Comparative Zoology (Fowler, 1941).

In a comprehensive survey of the Gulf of Carpentaria from 2001 to 2002 (Peverell, 2005; 2008), indicated
dwarf sawfish were concentrated in the west where 12 males and 10 females were captured. Most
individuals caught in the inshore fishery were immature except for two mature males: 10 ft and 9 ft 8 in
(306 cm and 296 cm) TL (Peverell, 2005; 2008).

Within specific riverine basins in northwestern Australia, dwarf sawfish have been reported in various
surveys. Forty-four dwarf sawfish were captured between October 2002 and July 2004, in the King Sound
and the Robison, May, and Fitzroy Rivers (Thorburn et al., 2008). Between 2001 and 2002, one dwarf
sawfish was caught at the mouth of the Fitzroy River in Western Australia (Morgan et al., 2004). Morgan et
al. (2011) acquired 109 rostra from dwarf sawfish from the King Sound area that were part of museum or
personal collections.

In summary, there is some uncertainty in the species identification of historic records of dwarf sawfish,
however, it appears the dwarf sawfish has become extirpated from much of the Indo-Pacific region and
from the eastern coast of Australia. An October 2001 study on the effectiveness of turtle- excluder devices
in the prawn trawl fishery in Queensland, Australia, reported no dwarf sawfish (Courtney et al., 2006).
Dwarf sawfish are now considered rare in the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is likely the Kimberley region and
Pilbara region (Western Australia) may be the last remaining areas for dwarf sawfish (P. Kyne, Charles
Darwin University, pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012).

Natural History of the Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis)

Taxonomy and Morphology

Many taxonomists have suggested classification of largetooth sawfish into a single circumtropical species
given common morphological features of robust rostrum, origin of first dorsal fin anterior to origin of pelvic
fins, and presence of a caudal-fin lower lobe (Guenther, 1870; Garman, 1913; Fowler, 1936; Poll, 1951;
Dingerkus, 1983; Daget, 1984; Seret and McEachran, 1986; McEachran and Fechhelm, 1998; Carvalho et
al., 2007). The recent analysis by Faria et al. (2013) used mtDNA (mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid)
and contemporary genetic analysis to argue that the previously classified P. pristis, P. microdon, and P.
perotteti should now be considered one species named P. pristis. After reviewing Faria et al. (2013) and
consulting other sawfish experts, we conclude, based on the best available information, that P. pristis
applies to all the largetooth sawfishes previously identified as P. pristis, P. microdon, and P. perotteti.

The largetooth sawfish has a robust rostrum, noticeably widening posteriorly (width between the two
posterior-most rostral teeth is 1.7 to 2 times the width between the second anterior-most rostral teeth).
Rostral tooth counts are between 14 and 23 per side with grooves on the posterior margin. The body is
robust with the origin of the first dorsal-fin anterior to the origin of the pelvic fin; dorsal fins are high and
pointed with the height of the second dorsal fin greater than the first. The lower lobe of the caudal-fin is
small, but well-defined, with the lower anterior margin about half as long as the upper anterior margin
(Wallace, 1967; Taniuchi et al., 1991a; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999; Deynat, 2005;
Wueringer et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2010b; Morgan et al., 2011). The largetooth
sawfish has buccopharyngeal denticles and regularly overlapping monocuspidate dermal denticles on its
skin. The denticles are present on both dorsal and ventral portions of the body (Wallace, 1967; Deynat,
2005). Within the mouth, there are between 70 and 72 tooth rows on the upper jaw, and 64 to 68 tooth
rows on the lower jaw. The number of vertebrae is between 226 and 228 (Morgan et al., 2010a).
Coloration of the largetooth sawfish is a reddish brown dorsally and dull white ventrally (Fowler, 1941;
Wallace, 1967; Compagno et al., 1989; Taniuchi et al., 1991a; Compagno and Last, 1999; Chidlow, 2007).

Page27of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Male and female largetooth sawfish differ in the number of rostral teeth. Using largetooth sawfish teeth
collected from Papua New Guinea and Australia, Ishihara et al. (1991b) found males to have an average
of 21 rostral teeth on the left and 22 on the right; females averaged 19 rostral teeth on both the left and the
right side of the rostrum.

[Page Number 73985]

Rostrum length can vary between males and females (Wueringer et al., 2009).

Habitat Use and Migration

Largetooth sawfish are found in coastal and inshore waters and are considered euryhaline (Compagno et
al., 1989; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999; Chisholm and Whittington, 2000; Last,
2002; Compagno, 2002b; Peverell, 2005; Peverell, 2008; Wueringer et al., 2009), being found in salinities
ranging from 0 to 40 ppt (Thorburn et al., 2007). The species has been found far upriver, often occupying
freshwater lakes and pools; they are associated with freshwater more than any other sawfish species
(Last and Stevens, 1994; Rainboth, 1996; Peter and Tan, 1997; Compagno and Last, 1999; Larson,
1999). Largetooth sawfish have even been observed in isolated fresh water billabongs or pools until
floodwaters allow them to escape; juveniles often use these areas for multiple years as deepwater refuges
(Gorham, 2006; Thorburn et al., 2007; Wueringer et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010b). Similarly, largetooth
sawfish have been found in Lake Nicaragua in depths up to 400 ft (122 m) and are found in deeper holes,
occupying muddy or sandy bottoms (Thorson, 1982). Adults more often use marine habitats than
juveniles, and are typically found in waters with salinity at 31 ppt (Wueringer et al., 2009).

Despite the variety of habitats occupied, females have been found to be highly philopatric as indicated by
mtDNA studies, while males often undergo long movements (Lack et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009;
Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2010b; Morgan et al., 2011). Largetooth sawfish occurred from the
Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico south through Brazil, and in the United States, largetooth sawfish were
reported in the Gulf of Mexico, mainly along the Texas coast (NMFS, 2010a). Largetooth sawfish were
rarely reported in U.S. waters and may have been long-distance migrants from the Caribbean or Brazil
(Feldheim et al., 2011).

The physical characteristics of habitat strongly influence the movements of, and areas used by, largetooth
sawfish. Recruitment of neonate largetooth sawfish was correlated with the rise in water levels during the
wet season in Australia (Whitty et al., 2009). A study of juvenile largetooth sawfish movements in the
Fitzroy River in Australia found young-of-the-year using extremely shallow areas (0 to 1 ft 7 in or 0 to 0.49
m) up to 80 percent of the time, mostly to avoid predators (Thorburn et al., 2007). Juvenile and adult
largetooth sawfish also use rivers (Compagno, 2002b; Gorham, 2006) and can be found in areas up to
248.5 miles (400 km) upstream (Morgan et al., 2004; Chidlow, 2007). The space used on a day to day
basis by largetooth sawfish increases with body length (Whitty et al., 2009).

Age and Growth

There are several age and growth studies for the largetooth sawfish; results vary due to differences in
aging techniques, data collection, or location. In Australia, largetooth sawfish are between 2 ft 6 in and 3 ft
(76 and 91 cm) TL at birth, with females being slightly smaller than males on average (Chidlow, 2007;
Morgan et al., 2011). Thorson (1982) found pups at birth average 2 ft 4.7 in to 2 ft 7.5 in (73-80 cm) TL,
with a growth rate of 1 ft 2 in to 1 ft 3 in (35-40) cm per year in Lake Nicaragua (NMFS, 2010a; Kyne and
Feutry, 2013). Peverell (2008) found that largetooth sawfish in the Indo-West Pacific are born at 2 ft 4 in to
2 ft 11 in (72-90 cm) TL. Juveniles (age 1 to age at maturity) range in size from 2 ft 6 in to 9 ft (76 to 277
cm) TL (Morgan et al., 2011).

Size at maturity in the Western Atlantic is estimated to be around 9 ft 10 in (300 cm) TL for both sexes at
around age 8 (Lack et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2010b; NMFS, 2010; Morgan et al.,
2011; Kyne and Feutry, 2013). Thorson (1982) estimated age of maturity to be 10 years at 9 ft 10 in (300
cm) TL in Lake Nicaragua. Peverell (2008) estimated age at maturity in the Gulf of Carpentaria to be
between 8 and 10 years. In the Indo-Pacific, males tend to mature earlier than other regions (9 ft 2 in (280
cm)) TL (Kyne and Feutry, 2013). Generally, males under 7 ft 7 in (230 cm) TL and females under 8 ft 10
in (270 cm) TL are considered immature (Whitty et al., 2009; Wueringer et al., 2009).

The largest recorded length of a largetooth sawfish is 22 ft 11 in (700 cm) TL (Compagno et al., 1989. The
largest largetooth sawfish recorded in the Kimberley, Queensland measured 21 ft 6 in (656 cm) TL
(Compagno and Last, 1999). In other areas of Australia, largetooth sawfish can reach up to 15 ft (457 cm)
and at least 11 ft 10 in (361 cm) TL (Fowler, 1941; Chidlow, 2007; Gunn et al., 2010). Thorson (1982)
estimated that largetooth sawfish in Lake Nicaragua only reach a maximum size of about 14 ft 1 in (430
cm) TL.

Page28of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Age and growth for largetooth sawfish has been estimated by Tanaka (1991) who generated a von
Bertalanffy growth model for specimens collected from Papua New Guinea and Australia. For both sexes
combined, the theoretical maximum size (L [infin.] ) from the von Bertalanffy growth equation was
calculated at 11 ft 11 in (363 cm) TL with a growth rate (K) of 0.066 per year. Largetooth sawfish grow
around 7 in (18 cm) in the first year and 4 in (10 cm) by the tenth year (Tanaka, 1991). Thorson (1982a)
estimated an early juvenile growth rate of 13-15 in (35 to 40 cm) per year and annual adult growth rate of
1 in (4.4 cm) per year based on largetooth from Lake Nicaragua. Simpfendorfer (2000) estimated the
theoretical maximum size of largetooth sawfish to be 14 ft 11 in (456 cm) TL with a growth rate (Brody
growth coefficient K) of 0.089 per year based on Thorson's (1982) data from Lake Nicaragua. Peverell
(2008) calculated that largetooth sawfish from the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia grow 1 ft 8.5 in (52 cm) in
the first year and 7 in (17 cm) during the fifth year. Maximum size was estimated at 20 ft 11 in (638 cm) TL
with a growth rate (Brody growth coefficient K) of 0.08 per year from the von Bertalanffy equation
(Peverell, 2008). Kyne and Feutry (2013) summarize maximum age estimates of 30 years in Lake
Nicaragua and 35 years in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Based on the von Bertalanffy equation, growth slows at
about 35 years or 19 ft 10 in (606 cm) TL (Kyne and Feutry, 2013).

Reproduction

Largetooth sawfish are thought to reproduce in freshwater environments (Compagno and Last, 1999; Last,
2002; Compagno, 2002b; Martin, 2005; Thorburn and Morgan, 2005; Compagno et al., 2006b). Pupping
seems to vary across the range, occurring during the wet season from May to July in the Indo-Pacific
(Raje and Joshi, 2003), and from October to December in the western Atlantic and Lake Nicaragua
(Thorson, 1976a; Kyne and Feutry, 2013).

The number of pups in a largetooth sawfish litter varies by location, possibly due to a number of factors.
One of the earliest reproductive studies on largetooth sawfish by Thorson (1976a) reported the litter sizes
of 67 females ranged between 1 to 13 pups and an embryonic sex ratio for this species is 0.86 males for
every 1 female. Average number of pups is 7 (NMFS, 2010a; Kyne and Feutry, 2013). Thorson (1976a)
also found that both ovaries appeared to be functional, with the left ovary producing more eggs. Estimates
of litter size from other studies in the Indo-West Pacific (e.g., Wilson, 1999; Moreno Iturria, 2012; Peverell,
2005) cannot be confirmed (Kyne and Feutry, 2013). Length of gestation for largetooth sawfish is
approximately five months in Lake Nicaragua, with a biennial

[Page Number 73986]

reproduction cycle (Thorson 1976a; NMFS 2010a; Kyne and Feutry, 2013). In the Indo-West Pacific,
largetooth sawfish may reproduce every year (Peverell, 2008).

Intrinsic rates of population growth vary tremendously throughout the species' range. Simpfendorfer
(2000) estimated that the largetooth sawfish in Lake Nicaragua had an intrinsic rate of population growth
of 0.05 to 0.07 per year, with a potential population doubling time of 10.3 to 13.6 years. Using data from
Australia, rates of population increase for the Indo-Pacific were estimated to be around 0.12 per year
(Moreno Iturria, 2012), with a population doubling time of approximately 5.8 years and a generation time of
14.6 years. Data from the western Atlantic Ocean indicate an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.03 per year,
with a population doubling time of 23.3 years and a generation time of 17.2 years (Moreno Iturria, 2012).
Annual natural mortality for the western Atlantic has been estimated at 0.07 to 0.16 (Simpfendorfer, 2000)
and 0.14 to 0.15 per year (Moreno Iturria, 2012).

Diet and Feeding

Largetooth sawfish diet is predominantly fish, but varies depending on geographic area. Small fishes
including seer fish, mackerels, ribbon fish, sciaenids, and pomfrets are likely main diet items of largetooth
sawfish in the Indian Ocean (Devadoss, 1978; Rainboth, 1996; Raje and Joshi, 2003). Small sharks,
mollusks, and crustaceans are also potential prey items (Devadoss, 1978; Rainboth, 1996; Raje and
Joshi, 2003). Taniuchi et al. (1991a) found small fishes and shrimp in the stomachs of juveniles in Lake
Murray, Papua New Guinea, while juveniles in Western Australia had catfish, cherabin, mollusks, and
insect parts in their stomachs (Thorburn et al., 2007; Whitty et al., 2009; Morgan et al,. 2010a). Largetooth
sawfish have also been found to feed on catfish, shrimp, croaker, small crustaceans, croaker, and
mollusks (Chidlow, 2007; Thorburn et al., 2007; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2010b). Largetooth
sawfish captured off South Africa had bony fish and shellfish as common diet items (Compagno et al.,
1989; Compagno and Last, 1999). In general, largetooth sawfish subsist on the most abundant small
schooling fishes in the area (NMFS, 2010a).

Population Structure

Genetic analyses based on specific sequences of mitochondrial DNA indicated largetooth sawfish can be
found in populations based on ocean basin: Atlantic, Indo-West Pacific, and Eastern Pacific. There is also

Page29of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.restricted flow of genes in largetooth sawfish between these geographic areas: Atlantic and Indo-West
Pacific; Atlantic and eastern Pacific; and Indo-West Pacific and eastern Pacific (Faria et al. 2013).

Genetic analyses based on a 480-base pair sequencing of the mtDNA gene NADH-2 sequence also
revealed information indicating largetooth sawfish subpopulations. West and East Atlantic subpopulations
differed as did samples from Australia and the wider Indian Ocean. Collectively, a total of 19 haplotypes
were identified across largetooth sawfish: One east Pacific haplotype, 12 western Atlantic haplotypes, two
eastern Atlantic haplotypes, one Indian Ocean haplotype, one Vietnamese-New Guinean haplotype, and
two Australian haplotypes (Faria et al., 2013). This fine-scale structuring by haplotypes was only partially
corroborated by the regional variation in the number of rostral teeth. While the rostral tooth count differed
significantly in largetooth sawfish collected from the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, it did not vary
significantly between specimens collected from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific (Faria et al., 2013).
Largetooth sawfish collected from the western Atlantic specimens had a higher rostral teeth count than
those collected from the eastern Atlantic. Data from separate protein and genetics studies indicates some
evidence of distinction among populations of largetooth sawfish in the Indo-Pacific. At a broad scale,
Watabe (1991) found that there was limited genetic variability between samples taken from Australia and
Papua New Guinea based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme patterns. Largetooth sawfish might
be genetically subdivided within the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, with both eastern and western Gulf
populations (Lack et al., 2009).

Phillips et al. (2011) found that the population of largetooth sawfish in the Gulf of Carpentaria is different
from animals on the west coast of Australia (Fitzroy River) based on mtDNA. Recent data (Phillips, 2012)
suggests that matrilineal structuring is found at relatively small spatial scales within the Gulf of Carpentaria
region (i.e., this region contains more than one maternal `population'), although the precise location and
nature of population boundaries are unknown. The difference in the genetic structuring using markers with
different modes of inheritance (maternal versus bi- parental) suggests that largetooth sawfish may have
male-biased dispersal and females remaining at, or returning to, their birth place to mate (Phillips et al.,
2009; Phillips, 2012). Phillips (2012) noted that the presence of male gene flow between populations in
Australian waters suggests that a decline of males in one location could affect the abundance and genetic
diversity of assemblages in other locations.

The genetic diversity for largetooth sawfish throughout Australia seems to be low to moderate. Genetic
diversity was greater in the Gulf of Carpentaria than in Australian rivers, also suggesting potential
philopatry: Animals return to or stay in their home range (Lack et al., 2009). Yet, given limited sampling,
additional research is needed to better understand potential population structure of largetooth sawfish in
Australia (Lack et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2010b).

Distribution and Abundance

Largetooth sawfish have the largest historical range of all sawfishes. The species historically occurred
throughout the Indo-Pacific near Southeast Asia and Australia and throughout the Indian Ocean to east
Africa. Older literature notes the presence of this species in Zanzibar, Madagascar, India, and the
southwest Pacific (Fowler, 1941; Wallace, 1967; Taniuchi et al., 2003). Largetooth sawfish have also been
noted in the Eastern Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Ecuador (Cook et al., 2005) or possibly Peru
(Chirichigno and Cornejo, 2001). In the Atlantic Ocean, largetooth sawfish inhabit warm temperate to
tropical marine waters from Brazil to the Gulf of Mexico in the western Atlantic, and Namibia to Mauritania
in the eastern Atlantic (Burgess et al., 2009).

Given the recent taxonomic changes for largetooth sawfish, we examined all current and historic records
of P. microdon, P. perotteti, and P. pristis for a comprehensive overview on distribution and abundance.
We conducted an extensive search of peer-reviewed publications and technical reports, newspaper,
records from the GBIF Database, and magazine articles. The results of that search are summarized below
by major geographic region.

Indian Ocean

Largetooth sawfish historically occurred throughout the Indian Ocean; however, current records are rare
for many areas. The earliest record of largetooth sawfish was in 1936 from Grand Lac near the Gulf of
Aden, Indian Ocean (Kottelat, 1985). A second record in 1936 is from the Mangoky River, Madagascar
(Taniuchi et al., 2003).

[Page Number 73987]

Records from the 1960s and 1970s are largely from India and South Africa. One largetooth sawfish was
reported from the confluence of the Lundi and Sabi Rivers, South Africa in 1960, over 200 miles (mi)
inland (Jubb, 1967). Between 1964 and 1966, several largetooth sawfish were caught in the Zambesi
River, South Africa during a general survey of rays and skates; largetooth sawfish have also been

Page30of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.recorded in the shark nets off Durban, South Africa (Wallace, 1967). In 1966, a male (10 ft; 305 cm TL)
was captured in a trawl net in the Gulf of Mannar, Sri Lanka (Gunn et al., 2010). Largetooth sawfish were
commonly caught between 1973 and 1974 in the Bay of Bengal during the wet season (July and
September) but rarely during other times of the year. Largetooth sawfish were also reported in three major
rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal: The Pennaiyar, Paravanar, and Gadilam (Devadoss, 1978).

Current reports of largetooth sawfish throughout the Indian Ocean are isolated and rare. Largetooth
sawfish were recorded in South Africa 1992 and 1993 between Nelson Mandela Bay and Cape Town.
Eight additional observations are reported in South Africa but associated date information was not
included (GBIF database). While the species could not be confirmed, a survey of fishing landing sites and
interviews with 99 fishers in Kenya by Nyingi found 71 reports of sawfishes over the last 40 years
(unpublished report from Dorothy Wanja Nyingi to J. Carlson, NMFS, 2007). The longest time series of
largetooth sawfish catches is from the swimmer protection beach nets off Natal, South Africa with a yearly
average capture rate of 0.2 sawfish per 0.6 mi (1 km) net per year from 1981 to 1990; since then only two
specimens have been caught (CITES, 2007). Largetooth sawfish were reported in Cochin, India by the
Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute in 1994, but no information about location, size, or number of
animals is available (Dan et al., 1994). Commercial landings of elasmobranchs from 1981 to 2000 in the
Bay of Bengal were mostly rays with some largetooth sawfish (Raje and Joshi, 2003). In the Betsiboka
River, Madagascar, four largetooth sawfish were caught in 2001. The most recent capture of a largetooth
sawfish (18 ft; 550 cm TL) in India occurred on January 18, 2011, between Karnataka and Goa
(www.mangalorean.com).

Indo-Pacific Ocean (Excluding Australia)

Many islands within the Indo-Pacific region contain suitable habitat for largetooth sawfish, but few reports
are available, perhaps due to the lack of surveys or data reporting. The earliest records of largetooth
sawfish from the Indo-Pacific are from a compilation study of elasmobranchs in the waters off Thailand
that reports a largetooth sawfish in the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries in 1945 (Vidthayanon, 2002).
In 1955, two largetooth sawfish were captured from Lake Sentani (present day Intan Jaya, Indonesia).
Juvenile largetooth sawfish have also been reported around the same time in a freshwater river close to
Genjem, Indonesia (Boeseman, 1956). In 1956, largetooth sawfish were recorded in Lake Sentani
(present day Intan Jaya, Indonesia), (Boeseman, 1956; Thorson et al., 1966). In a study by Munro (1967)
in the Laloki River in the southeastern portion of New Guinea, no sawfish were captured. From 1967 to
1977, five largetooth sawfish were captured from the Indragiri River, Sumatra (Taniuchi, 2002). The
presence of largetooth sawfish in the Mahakam River, Borneo was recorded in 1987 (Christensen, 1992).
Three largetooth sawfish rostra were acquired from local fish markets in Sabah in 1996 (Manjaji, 2002a).
Additional surveys of local fish markets indicate largetooth sawfish are still present in these areas,
although locals have noticed a decline in their abundance (Manjaji, 2002a). In 1996, two specimens were
found in Malaysia: One in Palau Nangka and one in Palau Besar (GBIF Database).

Multiple records of largetooth sawfish have occurred in areas throughout Papua New Guinea. From 1970
to 1971, Berra et al. (1975) collected five largetooth sawfish from the Laloki River, Papua New Guinea.
Four largetooth sawfish were recorded in 1975 from the Fly River system, Papua New Guinea and one in
1979 in the northern part of Papua New Guinea near new Tangu (GBIF Database). In a survey of the Fly
River system, Papua New Guinea, 23 individuals were captured in 1978 (Roberts, 1978; Taniuchi and
Shimizu, 1991; Taniuchi et al., 1991b; Taniuchi, 2002). There are two reports of largetooth sawfish in the
1980s in Papua New Guinea: One in 1987 and one in 1988 (GBIF Database). More recently, 36 largetooth
sawfish were captured in September 1989 in Papua New Guinea (Taniuchi and Shimizu, 1991; Taniuchi,
2002).

The scarcity of records from Indo-Pacific led to an increased effort to document species presence.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that largetooth sawfishes have not been recorded in Indo-Pacific for more
than 25 years (White and Last, 2010). Largetooth sawfish have not been recorded in the Mekong River,
Laos for decades (Rainboth, 1996). In a comprehensive study compiled by Compagno (2002a), no
sawfishes were found in the South China Sea between the years of 1923 and 1996. Data from 200 survey
days at fish landing sites in eastern Indonesia between 2001 and 2005 recorded over 40,000
elasmobranchs, but only 2 largetooth sawfish (White and Dharmadi, 2007; Kyne and Feutry, 2013).

Australia

Australia may have a higher abundance of largetooth sawfish than other areas within the species' current
range (Thorburn and Morgan, 2005; Field et al., 2009). Despite their current abundance levels, we only
identified a few historic records from Australia. The first record of a largetooth sawfish was in 1945 in the
Northern Territory (Stevens et al., 2005). There was a subsequent record in 1947, and two largetooth
sawfish from the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland were reported in 1959 (GBIF Database). Faria et al.
(2013) obtained a rostrum that was collected in Australia in 1960.

Page31of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Since the 1980s, we found significantly more records of largetooth sawfish in Australia than other regions.
A largetooth sawfish was captured from the Keep River, Australia in 1981 (Compagno and Last, 1999).
Three largetooth sawfish were recorded in 1984 near Marchinbar Island, Northern Territory (GBIF
Database). Blaber et al. (1990) found that largetooth sawfish were among the top twenty-five most
abundant species in the trawl fisheries of Albatross Bay from 1986 to 1988. Three largetooth sawfish were
reported from the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland: One in 1987 in Walker Creek, one in 1988 in the
Gilbert River, and one in 1991 in Marrakai Creek, a tributary of the Adelaide River, Northern Territory
(GBIF Database). Eight individuals were captured in the Leichhardt River in 2008 (Morgan et al., 2010b).
In a preliminary survey of the McArthur River, Northern Territory, Gorham (2006) reported two largetooth
sawfish captured between 2002 and 2006. Surveys (Peverell, 2005; Gill et al., 2006; Peverell, 2008) in the
Gulf of Carpentaria found largetooth sawfish widely distributed throughout the eastern portion of the Gulf
with most catches occurring near the mouth of

[Page Number 73988]

many rivers (Mitchell, et al., 2005; 2008).

Juvenile largetooth sawfish in Australia use the Fitzroy River and other tributaries of King Sound (Morgan
et al., 2004) as nursery areas while adults are found more often offshore (Morgan et al., 2010a). In
Western Australia, besides the Fitzroy River and King Sound, the only other areas where juvenile sawfish
have been recently recorded are in Willie Creek and Roebuck Bay (Gill et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2011).
Nursery areas for largetooth sawfish are also reported in northern Australia in the Gulf of Carpentaria
(Gorham, 2006). Juvenile largetooth sawfish have been captured within the Adelaide River, Australia in
2013 (P. Kyne, Charles Darwin University, pers. comm., 2013). Abundance estimates for the largetooth
sawfish from areas that support higher human populations may be declining (Taniuchi and Shimizu, 1991;
Taniuchi et al., 1991a; Morgan et al., 2010a). Whitty et al. (2009) found that the population of juvenile
largetooth sawfish in the Fitzroy River had declined; catch per unit effort was 56.7 sawfish per 100 hours
in 2003 compared to 12.4 in 2009. There were no reported captures of largetooth sawfish in 2008 from the
Roper River system, which drains into the western Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory (Dally and
Larson, 2008). No adult sawfish were captured in any of the prawn trawl fisheries in Queensland, Australia
during the month of October 2001 (Courtney et al., 2006).

Outside the northern and western areas of Australia, largetooth sawfish do occur but reports are less
frequent. In southwestern Australian waters, one female sawfish was captured by a commercial shark
fisherman in February 2003 east of Cape Naturaliste (Chidlow, 2007). Data from the Queensland,
Australia Shark Control Program shows a clear decline in sawfish catch over a 30 year period from the
1960s, and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern regions by 1993 (Stevens et al., 2005).

Eastern Pacific

In the eastern Pacific, the historic range of largetooth sawfish was from Mazatlan, Mexico to Guayaquil,
Ecuador (Cook et al., 2005) or possibly Peru (Chirichigno and Cornejo, 2001). There is very little
information on the population status in this region and few reports of capture records. The species has
been reported in freshwater in the Tuyra, Culebra, Tilapa, Chucunaque, Bayeno, and Rio Sambu Rivers,
and at the Balboa and Miraflores locks in the Panama Canal, Panama; in Rio San Juan, Colombia; and in
the Rio Goascoran, along the border of El Salvador and Honduras (Fowler, 1936, 1941; Beebe and
Tee-Van, 1941; Bigelow and Schroeder, 1953; Thorson et al., 1966a; Dahl, 1971; Thorson, 1974, 1976,
1982a, 1982b, 1987; Compagno and Cook, 1995; all as cited in Cook et al., 2005). There are 4 records of
largetooth sawfish south of Purto Vallarta, Mexico in 1975, and several reports from Panama with no
associated dates (GBIF Database). The only recent reports of largetooth sawfish in this area are
anecdotal reports from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Panama (R. Graham, Wildlife Conservation Society,
pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012).

Western Atlantic Ocean

In the western Atlantic Ocean, largetooth sawfish were widely distributed throughout the marine and
estuarine waters in tropical and subtropical climates and historically found from Brazil through the
Caribbean, Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and seasonally into waters of the United States (Burgess
et al., 2009). Largetooth sawfish also occurred in freshwater habitats in Central and South America.
Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the historical presence of the largetooth sawfish is uncertain and early
records might have been misidentified smalltooth sawfish (G. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History,
pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012).

Historic records of largetooth sawfish in the western north Atlantic have been previously reported in NMFS
(2010a). Sawfish were documented in Central America in Nicaragua as early as 1529 by a Spanish
chronicler (Gill and Bransford, 1877). This species was also historically reported in Nicaragua by Meek
(1907), Regan (1908), Marden (1944), Bigelow and Schroeder (1953) and Hagberg (1968). Five

Page32of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.largetooth sawfish were reported from a survey of Lake Izabal, Guatemala from 1946 to 1947, and
sawfishes were reported to be important to inland fisheries (Saunders et al., 1950). There is a single
largetooth sawfish report from Honduras, but the true origin of the rostrum and the date of capture could
not be confirmed (NMFS, 2010a).

In Atlantic drainages, largetooth sawfish has been found in freshwater at least 833 miles (1,340 km) from
the ocean in the Amazon River system (Manacapuru, Brazil), as well as in Lake Nicaragua and the San
Juan River; the Rio Coco, on the border of Nicaragua and Honduras; Rio Patuca, Honduras; Lago de
Izabal, Rio Motagua, and Rio Dulce, Guatemala; and the Belize River, Belize. Largetooth sawfish are
found in Mexican streams that flow into the Gulf of Mexico; Las Lagunas Del Tortuguero, Rio Parismina,
Rio Pacuare, and Rio Matina, Costa Rica; and the Rio San Juan and the Magdalena River, Colombia
(Thorson, 1974, 1982b; Castro-Augiree, 1978 as cited in Thorson, 1982b; Compagno and Cook, 1995; C.
Scharpf and M. McDavitt, National Legal Research Group, Inc., as cited in Cook et al., 2005).

In the United States, largetooth sawfish were reported in the Gulf of Mexico mainly along the Texas coast
east into Florida waters, though nearly all records of largetooth sawfish encountered in U.S. waters were
limited to the Texas coast (NMFS, 2010a). Though reported in the United States, it appears that largetooth
sawfish were never abundant, with approximately 39 confirmed records (33 in Texas) from 1910 through
1961.

The Amazon River basin and adjacent waters are traditionally the most abundant known range of
largetooth sawfish in Brazil (Bates, 1964; Marlier, 1967; Furneau, 1969). Most of the records for which
location is known originated in the state of Amazonas, which encompasses the middle section of the
Amazon River basin along with the confluence of the Rio Negro and Rio Solimoes Rivers. The other
known locations are from the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Sergipe, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Para, and Maranhao (NMFS, 2010a). Most records of largetooth sawfish in the
Amazon River (Amazonia) predate 1974. The Magdalena River estuary was the primary source for
largetooth sawfish encounters in Colombia from the 1940's (Miles, 1945), while other records originated
from the Bahia de Cartagena and Isla de Salamanca (both marine), and Rio Sinu (freshwater) from the
1960's through the 1980's (Dahl, 1964; 1971; Frank and Rodriguez, 1976; Alvarez and Blanco, 1985). In
other areas of South America, there are only single records from Guyana, French Guiana, and Trinidad
from the late 1800's and early 1900's. Of the 5 records from Suriname, the most recent was 1962. Though
thought to have once been abundant in some areas of Venezuela (Cervignon, 1966a, 1966b), the most
recent confirmed records of largetooth sawfish from that country was in 1962.

Many records in the 1970's and 1980's are largely due to Thorson's (1982a, 1982b) research on the Lake
Nicaragua-Rio San Juan system in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Bussing (2002) indicated that this species
was known to inhabit the Rio Tempisque and tributaries of the San Juan basin in Costa Rica. Following
Thorson's (1982a, 1982b) studies,

[Page Number 73989]

records of largetooth sawfish in the western North Atlantic decline considerably. By 1981, Thorson (1982a)
was unable to locate a single live specimen in the original areas he surveyed. There are no known
Nicaraguan records of the largetooth sawfish outside of the Lake Nicaragua-Rio San Juan- Rio Colorado
system (Burgess et al., 2009), although largetooth sawfish are still captured incidentally by fishers netting
for other species (McDavitt, 2002). Of the known largetooth sawfish reported from Mexico, most records
are prior to 1978 (NMFS, 2010a). Caribbean records are very sparse (NMFS, 2010a). The last record of a
largetooth sawfish in U.S. waters was in 1961 (Burgess et al., 2009).

Most recent records for largetooth sawfish are in isolated areas. While many reports of largetooth sawfish
from Brazil were from the 1980's and 1990's (Lessa, 1986; Martins-Juras et al., 1987; Stride and Batista,
1992; Menni and Lessa, 1998; and Lessa et al., 1999), recent records indicate largetooth sawfish are
primarily found in fish markets near the Amazon-Orinoco estuaries (Charvet-Almeida, 2002; Burgess et
al., 2009). A Lake Nicaragua fisherman reports he encounters a few sawfish annually (McDavitt, 2002).
Other records are rare for the area. Three recent occurrences were found in Internet searches, one being
a 200 lb. (90.7 kg) specimen caught recreationally in Costa Rica (Burgess et al., 2009). Though reported
by Thorson et al. (1966a, 1966b) to be common throughout the area, there are no recent reports of
encounters with sawfishes in Guatemala. Scientists in Colombia have not reported any sawfish sightings
between 1999 and 2009 (Burgess et al., 2009).

Eastern Atlantic Ocean

Historic records indicate that largetooth sawfish were once relatively common in the coastal estuaries
along the west coast of Africa. Verified records exist from Senegal (1841-1902), Gambia (1885-1909),
Guinea-Bissau (1912), Republic of Guinea (1965), Sierra Leone (date unknown), Liberia (1927), Cote
d'Ivoire (1881-1923), Congo (1951-1958), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1951-1959), and Angola

Page33of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.(1951). Most records, however, lacked species identification and locality data and may have been
confused taxonomically with other species. Unpublished notes from a 1950's survey detail 12 largetooth
sawfish from Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria, ranging in size from 35-275 in
(89-700 cm) TL (Burgess et al., 2009).

A more recent status review by Ballouard et al. (2006) reported that sawfishes, including the largetooth
sawfish, were once common from Mauritania to the Republic of Guinea, but are now rarely captured or
encountered. According to this report, the range of sawfishes has decreased to the Bissagos Archipelago
(Guinea Bissau). The most recent sawfish encounters outside Guinea Bissau were in the 1990's in
Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, and the Republic of Guinea. The most recent documented largetooth
sawfish capture was from 2005 in Nord de Caravela (Guinea Bissau), along with anecdotal accounts from
fishers of captures off of two islands in the same area in 2008 (Burgess et al., 2009).

In summary, on a global scale, largetooth sawfish appear to have been severely fragmented throughout
their historic range into isolated populations of low abundance. Largetooth sawfish are now considered
very rare in many places where evidence is available, including parts of East Africa, India, parts of the
Indo-Pacific region, Central and South America and West Africa. Even within areas like Australia and
Brazil, the species is primarily located in remote areas. Information from genetic studies indicates that
largetooth sawfish display strong sex-biased dispersal patterns; with females exhibiting patterns of natal
philopatry while males move more broadly between populations (Phillips et al., 2011). Thus, the
opportunity for re-establishment of these isolated populations is limited because any reduction in female
abundance in one region is not likely to be replenished by movement from another region (Phillips, 2012).

Natural History of Green Sawfish (Pristis zijsron)

Taxonomy and Morphology

Pristis zijsron (Bleeker, 1851) is frequently known as the narrowsnout sawfish or the green sawfish.
Synonymous names include P. dubius (Gloerfelt- Tarp and Kailola, 1984; Van Oijen et al., 2007;
Wueringer et al., 2009). An alternative spelling for this species' scientific name (P. zysron) is found in older
literature, due to either inconsistent writing or errors in translation or transcription (Van Oijen et al., 2007).

The green sawfish has a narrow saw with 25-32 small, slender rostral teeth; tooth count may vary
geographically (Marichamy, 1969; Last and Stevens, 1994; Morgan et al., 2010a). Specimens collected
along the west coast of Australia have 24-30 left rostral teeth and 23-30 right rostral teeth (Morgan et al.,
2010a), although other reports are 23-34 (Morgan et al., 2011). There have been no studies to determine
sexual dimorphism from rostral tooth counts for green sawfish. The rostral teeth are generally denser near
the base of the saw than at the apical part of the saw (Blegvad and Loppenthin, 1944). The total rostrum
length is between 20.6-29.3 percent of the total length of the animal and may vary based on the number
and size of individuals. In general, green sawfish have a greater rostrum length to total length ratio than
other sawfish species (Morgan et al., 2010a, 2011).

In terms of body morphology, the origin of the first dorsal fin on green sawfish is slightly posterior to the
origin of pelvic fins. The lower caudal lobe is not well defined and there is no subterminal notch
(Gloerfelt-Tarp and Kailola, 1984; Compagno et al., 1989; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last,
1999; Bonfil and Abdallah, 2004; Wueringer et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011). The
green sawfish has limited buccopharyngeal denticles and regularly overlapping monocuspidate dermal
denticles on its skin. As a result, there are no keels or furrows formed on the skin (Deynat, 2005). The
green sawfish is greenish brown dorsally and white ventrally. This species might be confused with the
dwarf or smalltooth sawfish due to its similar size and range (Compagno et al., 2006c).

Habitat Use and Migration

The green sawfish mostly uses inshore, marine habitats, but it has been found in freshwater environments
(Gloerfelt-Tarp and Kailola, 1984; Compagno et al., 1989; Compagno, 2002b; Stevens et al., 2008;
Wueringer et al., 2009). In the Gilbert and Walsh Rivers of Queensland, Australia, specimens have been
captured as far as 149 miles (240 km) upriver (Grant, 1991). However, Morgan et al. (2010a, 2011) report
green sawfish do not move into freshwater for any portion of their lifecycle. Like most sawfishes, the green
sawfish prefers muddy bottoms in estuarine environments (Last, 2002). The maximum depth recorded for
this species is 131 ft (40 m) but it is often found in much shallower waters, around 16 ft (5 m; Compagno
and Last, 1999; Wueringer et al., 2009). Adults tend to spend more time in offshore waters in Australia, as
indicated by interactions with the offshore Pilbara Fish Trawl Fishery, while juveniles prefer protected,
inshore waters (Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011).

Age and Growth

Page34of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.At birth pups are between 2 ft and 2 ft 7 in (61 and 80 cm) TL. At age 1 green sawfish are generally
around 4 ft 3 in (130 cm) TL (Morgan et al., 2010a). Peverell (2008) found between ages 1 and 5, green
sawfish measure between 4 ft 2 in and 8 ft 5 in (128 and 257 cm) TL, based on the vertebral analysis of 6
individuals (Peverell, 2008; Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011). A 12 ft 6 in (380 cm) TL green
sawfish was found to be age 8, a 14 ft 4 in (438 cm) TL individual was found to be age 10, a 14 ft 9 in (449
cm) TL specimen was found to be age 16, and a 15 ft (482 cm) TL specimen was found to be age 18
(Peverell, 2008; Morgan et al., 2011).
Adult green sawfish often reach 16 ft 5 in (5 m) TL, but may grow as large as 23 ft (7 m) TL (Compagno et
al., 1989; Grant, 1991; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999; Bonfil and Abdallah, 2004;
Compagno et al., 2006c; Morgan et al., 2010a). The largest green sawfish collected in Australia was
estimated to be 19 ft 8 in (600 cm) TL based on a rostrum length of 5 ft 5 in (165.5 cm; Morgan et al.,
2010a; Morgan et al., 2011).

Peverell (2008) completed an age and growth study for green sawfish using vertebral growth bands. Von
Bertalanffy growth model parameters from both sexes combined resulted in estimated maximum
theoretical size of 16 ft (482 cm) TL, relative growth rate of 0.12 per year and theoretical time at zero
length of 1.12 yrs. The theoretical maximum age for this species is calculated to be 53 years (Peverell,
2008; Morgan et al., 2010a).

Reproduction

Last and Stevens (2009) reported size at maturity for green sawfish at 9 ft 10 in (300 cm) TL,
corresponding to age 9. In contrast, Peverell (2008) reported one mature individual of 12 ft 4 in (380 cm)
TL and estimated its age as 9 yrs. Using the growth function from Peverell (2008) and assuming length of
maturity at 118 in (300 cm), Moreno Iturria (2012) determined maturation is likely to occur at age 5.
Demographic models based on life history data from the Gulf of Carpentaria indicate the generation time is
14.6 years, the intrinsic rate of population increase is 0.02 per year, and population doubling time is
approximately 28 years (Moreno Iturria, 2012).

Green sawfish give birth to as many as 12 pups during the wet season (January through July); Last and
Stevens, 1994; Peverell, 2008; Morgan et al., 2010a, 2011). In Western Australia, females are known to
pup in areas between One Arm Point and Whim Creek, with limited data for all other areas (Morgan et al.,
2010a; Morgan et al., 2011). The Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia is also a known nursery area for green
sawfish (Gorham, 2006). It is not known where the green sawfish breed or their length of gestation.

Diet and Feeding

Like other sawfish, green sawfish use their rostra to stun small, schooling fishes, such as mullet, or use it
to dig up benthic prey, including mollusks and crustaceans (Breder Jr., 1952; Rainboth, 1996; Raje and
Joshi, 2003; Compagno et al., 2006c; Last and Stevens, 2009). One specimen captured in 1967 in the
Indian Ocean had jacks and razor fish (Caranx and Centriscus) species in its stomach (Marichamy, 1969).
In Australia, the diet of this species often includes shrimp, croaker, salmon, glassfish, grunter, and
ponyfish (Morgan et al., 2010a).

Population Structure

Faria et al. (2013) found no global population structure for green sawfish in their genetic studies. However,
geographical variation was found in the number of rostral teeth per side, suggesting some population
structure may occur. Green sawfish from the Indian Ocean have a higher number of rostral teeth per side
than those from western Pacific specimens (Faria et al., 2013).

In Australia, genetic analysis found differences in green sawfish between the west coast, the east coast,
and the Gulf of Carpentaria (Phillips et al., 2011). Genetic data suggests these populations are structured
matrilineally (from the mother to daughter) but there is no information on male gene flow at this time.
These results may be indicative of philopatry where adult females return to or remain in the same area
they were born (Morgan et al., 2010a; Morgan et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2011). Phillips et al. (2011) also
found low levels of genetic diversity for green sawfish in the Gulf of Carpentaria, suggesting the population
may have undergone a genetic bottleneck.

Distribution and Abundance

The green sawfish historically ranged throughout the Indo-West Pacific from South Africa northward along
the east coast of Africa, through the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Southern Asia, Indo-Australian archipelago,
and east to Asia as far north as Taiwan and Southern China (Fowler, 1941; Blegvad and Loppenthin,
1944; Smith, 1945; Misra, 1969; Compagno et al., 2002a, 2002b; Last and Stevens, 2009). Historic
records indicating species presence are available from India, Southeast Asia, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, New South Wales, and Australia (Cavanagh et al., 2003; Wueringer et al., 2009; Morgan et al.,

Page35of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.2010a; Morgan et al., 2011). Green sawfish have also been found in South Africa, the South China Sea,
and the Persian Gulf (Fowler, 1941; Compagno et al., 1989; Grant, 1991; Compagno and Last, 1999; Last,
2002; Compagno, 2002b; Morgan et al., 2010a). To evaluate the current distribution and abundance of the
green sawfish, we conducted an extensive search of peer-reviewed publications and technical reports,
newspaper, magazine articles, and the GBIF Database. The results are summarized by geographic area.

Indian Ocean

Green sawfish are widely distributed throughout the Indian Ocean with the first record coming from Saudi
Arabia in 1830 (GBIF Database). An additional record was reported from the Indian Ocean in the 1850s
(GBIF Database). Several green sawfish were described near the Indian archipelago in the late 1800s
(Van Oijen et al., 2007). Additional historical records include one female specimen captured in the Red
Sea near Dollfus in 1929. In Egypt, two green sawfish rostra were found in 1938, and an additional
rostrum was found on Henjam Island, Gulf of Oman (Blegvad and Loppenthin, 1994).

Unconfirmed reports of green sawfish are available from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. In 1963,
a male was captured at Port Blair, Gulf of Andaman (James, 1973). A female was captured in 1967, in the
same area (Marichamy, 1969). One green sawfish was captured in the St. Lucia estuary, South Africa
during a survey between 1975 and 1976 (Whitfield, 1999). In 1984, a green sawfish was observed in
Trafalgar, South Africa (GBIF Database).

Despite historic records, there are few current records of green sawfish in the Indian Ocean. There are
some reports of green sawfish from Iraq, Iran, South Africa, and Pakistan, but no dates are available
(GBIF Database). We presume green sawfish are extremely rare or extirpated in the Indian Ocean based
on the lack of current records.

Indo-Pacific Ocean (Excluding Australia)

The first description of the green sawfish was based on a rostral saw (Bleeker, 1851) from Bandjarmasin,
Borneo (Van Oijen et al., 2007). A juvenile male was captured in Amboine, Indonesia in 1856 (Deynat,
2005). An isolated saw from the Gulf of Thailand

[Page Number 73991]

was obtained in 1895 and estimated to be from a green sawfish 4 ft 8 in (143 cm) TL (Deynat, 2005). Eight
specimens were sent to the Wistar Institute of Anatomy in 1898 from Baram, British North Borneo (Fowler,
1941). One green sawfish was reported from East Sepik, Papua New Guinea in 1929 (GBIF Database). In
1940, a green sawfish specimen was collected from Zamboanga, Philippines (GBIF Database).

Many islands within the Indo-Pacific region contain suitable habitat for sawfish, but few records are
available, possibly due to the lack of surveys or data reporting. Before 1995, there were few local scientific
studies on elasmobranchs, and only two species of freshwater rays had been recorded in Borneo. As a
result, a great effort to document any unknown species was undertaken by Fowler (2002). Rostra and
records were documented in the study, including several dried rostra of green sawfish from the
Kinabatangan River area in the local markets of Sabah, Borneo; no collection specifics were provided.
Locals also indicated that this species could often be found in the Labuk Bay area (Manjaji, 2002a) and in
the country's freshwater systems (Manjaji, 2002b); they also reported a decline of sawfish populations
overall.

Elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region, few records of green sawfish have been reported. This species is
currently considered endangered in Thailand by Vidthayanon (2002) and Compagno (2002a); they also
reported no sawfish species from the South China Sea from 1923 to 1996. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that sawfishes have not been recorded in Indonesia for more than 25 years (White and Last, 2010).
Several reports of green sawfish exist from Malaysia, Indonesia, and New Zealand without any associated
dates (GBIF Database).

Australia

In Australian waters, the earliest museum collection of the green sawfish was in 1913 in Llyod Bay,
Queensland, Australia (GBIF Database). The Queensland Museum houses a green sawfish specimen
collected in 1929 that was found in Moreton Bay, Queensland (Fowler, 1941). Two records exist of green
sawfish collected in 1936 from Adeliade, South Australia (GBIF Database). We found very few records for
green sawfish during the middle part of the last century. In the late 1970s and 1980s, reports of green
sawfish began to occur again. In 1978, green sawfish were recorded in the Western Territory by CSIRO
(GBIF Database). There are multiple observations in 1980 of green sawfish in Australia: two from the
Northern Territory, and one from the Gulf of Carpentaria (GBIF Database). A green sawfish was observed
in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1981 by CSIRO. Two were observed in Western Australia, one in 1982 and
one in 1983 (GBIF Database). Two green sawfish were captured from Balgal, Queensland, Australia in

Page36of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.1985 (Beveridge and Campbell, 2005). In the Gulf of Carpentaria, two green sawfish were recorded in
1986, and one was recorded in 1987 (GBIF Database).

One green sawfish was caught in the southern portion of the Gulf of Carpentaria in late 1990 during a fish
fauna survey (Blaber et al., 1994). Alexander (1991) captured a female green sawfish from the west coast
of Australia that was used for a morphological study. Between 1994 and 2010, almost 50 tissue samples
were taken from live green sawfish or dried rostra from multiple areas around Australia, primarily the Gulf
of Carpentaria and northwest and northeast coasts (Phillips et al., 2011). In 1997, one green sawfish was
found at the mouth of Buffalo Creek near Darwin, Northern Territory (Chisholm and Whittington, 2000). In
a survey from 1999 through 2001 by White and Potter, (2004), one green sawfish was captured in Shark
Bay, Queensland. In 1999, one green sawfish was captured by CSIRO from the Gulf of Carpentaria (GBIF
Database). Peverell (2005, 2008) noted the green sawfish was one of the least encountered species in a
survey from the Gulf of Carpentaria. In 2004, one green sawfish was reported near Darwin, Northern
Territory by the European Molecular Biology Lab (GBIF Database). No green sawfish were captured from
the Roper River system in 2008, which drains into the western Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory
(Dally and Larson, 2008). Some records have been reported for the east coast of Australia; one female
green sawfish was acoustically tracked for 27 hours in May 2004 (Peverell and Pillans, 2004; Porteous,
2004). Peverell (2005, 2008) noted the green sawfish was one of the least encountered species in a
survey from the Gulf of Carpentaria.

In summary, limited data makes it difficult to determine the current range and abundance of green sawfish.
Nonetheless, given the uniqueness (size and physical characteristics) of the sawfish, we believe the lack
of records in the areas where the species was historically found indicates the species is no longer present
or has declined to extremely low levels. Extensive surveys at fish landing sites throughout Indonesia since
2001 have failed to record the green sawfish (White pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012). There is some evidence
from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea (e.g., Sudan) of small but extant populations (A. Moore, RSK
Environment Ltd., pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012). Green sawfish are currently found primarily along the
northern coast of Australia, but all sawfish species have undergone significant declines in Australian
waters. The southern extent of the range of green sawfishes in Australia has contracted (Harry et al.,
2011). Green sawfish have been reported as far south as Sydney, New South Wales, but are rarely found
as far south as Townsville, Queensland (Porteous, 2004).

Natural History of the Non-Listed Population(s) of Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata)

This section includes information from the listed U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish. The U.S. DPS of
smalltooth sawfish was listed as endangered on April 1, 2003 (68 FR 15674). The basis of the U.S. DPS
smalltooth sawfish listing was the significant differences in management across international borders. We
discuss information from the U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish here because there is very little basic
biological information on smalltooth sawfish found outside the U.S. We believe the information from the
U.S. DPS is likely representative of the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish and is useful for
understanding its biology and extinction risk.

Taxonomy and Morphology

The smalltooth sawfish was first described as Pristis pectinatus, Latham 1794. The name was changed to
the currently valid P. pectinata to match gender of the genus and species as required by the International
Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

The smalltooth sawfish has a thick body with a moderately sized rostrum. As with many other sawfishes,
tooth count varies by individual or region. While there is no reported difference in rostral tooth count
between sexes, there have been reports of sexual dimorphism in tooth shape, with males having broader
teeth than females (Wueringer et al., 2009). Rostral teeth are denser near the apex of the saw than the
base. Most studies report a rostral tooth count of 25 to 29 for smalltooth sawfish (Wueringer et al., 2009).
The saw may constitute up to one-fourth of the total body length (McEachran and De Carvalho, 2002).

The pectoral fins are broad and long with the origin of the first dorsal fin over or anterior to the origin of the

[Page Number 73992]

pelvic fins (Faria et al., 2013). The lower caudal lobe is not well defined and lacks a ventral lobe (Wallace,
1967; Gloerfelt-Tarp and Kailola, 1984; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999; Bonfil and
Abdallah, 2004; Wueringer et al., 2009). This species has between 228 and 232 vertebrae (Wallace,
1967).

The smalltooth sawfish has buccopharyngeal denticles and regularly overlapping monocuspidate
(single-pointed) dermal denticles on their skin. As a result, there are no keels or furrows formed on the
skin (Last and Stevens, 1994; Deynat, 2005). The body is an olive grey color dorsally, with a white ventral

Page37of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.surface (Compagno et al., 1989; Last and Stevens, 1994; Compagno and Last, 1999). This species may
be confused with the narrow or green sawfish (Compagno, 2002b).

Habitat Use and Migration

All research on habitat use and migration has been conducted on the U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish. A
summary of recent information (NMFS, 2010b) indicates smalltooth sawfish are generally found in shallow
waters with varying salinity level that are associated with red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle). Juvenile
sawfish appear to have small home ranges and limited movements. Simpfendorfer et al. (2011) reported
smalltooth sawfish have an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24 ppt, suggesting movements
are likely made, in part, to remain within this salinity range. Therefore, freshwater flow may affect the
location of individuals within an estuary. Poulakis et al. (2011) found juvenile smalltooth sawfish had an
affinity for water less than 3 ft (1.0 m) deep, water temperatures greater than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30
degrees Celsius), dissolved oxygen greater than 6 mg per liter, and salinity between 18 and 30 ppt.
Greater catch rates for smalltooth sawfish less than 1 year old were associated with shoreline habitats
with overhanging vegetation such as mangroves. Poulakis et al. (2012) further determined daily activity
space of smalltooth sawfish is less than 1 mi (0.7 km) of river distance. Hollensead (2012) reported
smalltooth sawfish activity areas ranged in size from 837 square yards to 240,000 square yards to
approximately 3 million square yards (0.0007 to 2.59 km^2^) with average range of movements of 2.3
yards to 6.67 yards (2.4 to 6.1 m) per minute. Hollensead (2012) also found no difference in activity area
or range of movement between ebb and flood, or high and low tide. Smalltooth sawfish movements at
night suggest possible nocturnal foraging. Using a combination of data from pop-off archival transmitting
tags across multiple institutional programs, movements and habitat use of adult smalltooth sawfish were
determined in southern Florida and the Bahamas (Carlson et al., 2013). Smalltooth sawfish generally
remained in coastal waters at shallow depths less than 32 ft; (10 m) for more than 96 percent of the time
that they were monitored. Smalltooth sawfish also remained in warm water temperatures of 71.6 to 82.4
degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 28 degrees Celsius) within the region where they were initially tagged. Tagged
smalltooth sawfish traveled an average of 49 mi (80.2 km) from deployment to pop-off location during an
average of 95 days. No smalltooth sawfish tagged in U.S. or Bahamian waters have been tracked to
countries outside where they were tagged.

Age and Growth

There is no age and growth data for smalltooth sawfish outside of the U.S. DPS. A summary of age and
growth data on the U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (NMFS, 2010b) indicates rapid juvenile growth for
smalltooth sawfish for the first two years after birth. Recently, Scharer et al. (2012) counted bands on
sectioned vertebrae from naturally deceased smalltooth sawfish and estimated von Bertalanffy growth
parameters. Theoretical maximum size was estimated at 14.7 ft (4.48 m), relative growth was 0.219 per
year, with theoretical maximum size at 15.8 years.

Reproduction

In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, smalltooth sawfish have been recorded breeding in Richard's Bay and St.
Lucia, South Africa (Wallace, 1967; Compagno et al., 1989; Compagno and Last, 1999). Pupping grounds
are usually inshore, in marine or fresh water. Pupping occurs year-around in the tropics, but in only spring
and summer at higher latitudes (Compagno and Last, 1999). Records of captive breeding have been
reported from the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort Aquarium in Nassau, Bahamas; copulatory behavior
was observed in 2003 and six months later the female aborted the pups for unknown reasons (McDavitt,
2006). In October 2012, a female sawfish gave birth to five live pups at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort
Aquarium in Nassau, Bahamas (J. Choromanski, Ripley's Entertainment pers. comm to NMFS, 2013).

Several studies have examined demography of smalltooth sawfish in U.S. waters. Moreno Iturria (2012)
calculated demographic parameters for smalltooth sawfish in U.S. waters and estimated intrinsic rates of
increase at seven percent annually with a population doubling time of 9.7 years. However, preliminary
results of a different model by Carlson et al. (2012) indicates population increase rates may be greater, up
to 17.6 percent annually, for the U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish. It is not clear which of these
models is more appropriate for the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish.

Diet and Feeding

Smalltooth sawfish often use their rostrum saw in a side-sweeping motion to stun their prey, which may
include small fishes, or to dig up invertebrates from the bottom (Breder Jr., 1952; Compagno et al., 1989;
Rainboth, 1996; McEachran and De Carvalho, 2002; Raje and Joshi, 2003; Last and Stevens, 2009;
Wueringer et al., 2009).

Population Structure

Page38of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.A qualitative examination of genetic sequences revealed no geographical structuring of smalltooth sawfish
haplotypes; however, variation in the number of rostral teeth per side was found in specimens from the
western and eastern Atlantic Ocean (Faria et al., 2013).

Distribution and Abundance

Smalltooth sawfish were thought to be historically found in South Africa, Madagascar, the Red Sea,
Arabia, India, the Philippines, along the coast of West Africa, portions of South America including Brazil,
Ecuador, the Caribbean Sea, the Mexican Gulf of Mexico, as well as Bermuda (Bigelow and Scheroder,
1953; Wallace, 1967; Van der Elst 1981; Compagno et al., 1989; Last and Stevens, 1994; IUCN, 1996;
Compagno and Last, 1999; McEachran and De Carvalho, 2002; Monte-Luna et al., 2009; Wueringer et al.,
2009). Yet, reports of smalltooth sawfish from other than the Atlantic Ocean are likely misidentifications of
other sawfish (Faria et al., 2013). The lack of confirmed reports of smalltooth sawfish from areas other
than the Atlantic Ocean indicates that smalltooth sawfish are only found in the Atlantic Ocean. In the
eastern Atlantic Ocean, smalltooth sawfish were historically found along the west coast of Africa from
Angola to Mauritania (Faria et al., 2013). Although smalltooth sawfish were included in historic faunal lists
of species found in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena, 2005), it is still unclear if smalltooth sawfish occurred
as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or were only seasonal migrants.

To evaluate the current and historic distribution and abundance of the

[Page Number 73993]

smalltooth sawfish outside the U.S. DPS, we conducted an extensive search of peer-reviewed publications
and technical reports, newspaper, records from the GBIF Database, and magazine articles. The results of
that search are summarized by major geographic region.

Eastern Atlantic Ocean

Smalltooth sawfish were once common in waters off the west coast of Africa, but are now rarely reported
or documented in the area. The earliest record of a smalltooth sawfish is a specimen from Namibia in
1874 (GBIF Database). Other records of smalltooth sawfish in Africa occurred in 1907 from Cameroon,
five males and two females. Female specimens were recorded in the Republic of the Congo in 1911 and
1948. Other reports from the Republic of Congo include a male and two females, but dates were not
recorded. An undated female specimen from Mauritania was recorded (Faria et al., 2013). A rostrum from
Pointe Noire, Molez, Republic of the Congo was found in 1958 (Deynat, 2005; Faria et al., 2013). There
are records of smalltooth sawfish from Senegal as early as 1956 and another rostral saw was recorded in
1959. Faria et al. (2013) also reports on four other rostra from Senegal, but no other information is
available.

Many records of smalltooth sawfish from the eastern Atlantic Ocean are reported in the GBIF database
during the 1960s, particularly between 1963 and 1964. The majority of these records are from Nigeria
(118), but others are from Gabon (77), Ghana (51), Cameroon (43), and Liberia (39). Another online
database, Fishbase (www.fishbase.org), has the same records. It is unclear if these records are
duplicative due to the lack of specific information.

In the 1970s, records of smalltooth sawfish became limited to more northern areas of West Africa. One
rostral saw from Senegal was recorded in 1975 (Alexander, 1991). Similarly, one rostral saw was reported
from Gambia in 1977, but information about exact location or sex of the animal was absent (Faria et al.,
2013). Faria et al. (2013) report a record of smalltooth sawfish in Guinea-Bissau in 1983 and a record of a
saw in 1987. For a morphological study, Deynat (2005) obtained a juvenile female from Cacheu,
Guinea-Bissau in 1983, and another from Port-Etienne, Mauritania, in 1986. Two rostra were reported
from the Republic of Guinea, one in 1980 and one in 1988 (Faria et al., 2013).

In the last 10 years, there has been only one confirmed record of a smalltooth sawfish in the eastern
Atlantic Ocean in Sierra Leone, West Africa, in 2003 (M. Diop, pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012). Two other
countries have recently reported sawfish (Guinea Bissau, Africa in 2011, and Mauritania in 2010), but
these reports did not identify the species as smalltooth sawfish.

Western Atlantic Ocean (Outside U.S Waters)

Overall, records of smalltooth sawfish in the western Atlantic Ocean are scarce and show a
non-continuous range, potentially due to misidentification with largetooth sawfish. Faria et al. (2013)
summarized most records of smalltooth sawfish in these areas. Faria et al. (2013) report the earliest
records are a female smalltooth sawfish from Haiti in 1831 and a female sawfish from Trinidad and
Tobago in 1876 (Faria et al., 2013). One smalltooth sawfish was recorded in Belem, Brazil in 1863 (GBIF
Database). Two smalltooth sawfish saws were reported from Guyana in 1886, and an additional saw was

Page39of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.later recorded in 1900. In Brazil, there is a 1910 report of a female smalltooth sawfish. In 1914, there is a
report of a smalltooth sawfish in Laguna de Terminos, Mexico (GBIF Database).

In the middle part of the twentieth century, there are reports of two female smalltooth sawfish from Mexico
in 1926. Rostral saws were found in Suriname in 1943, 1944, and 1963, but no additional location or
specimen information is known. One rostrum was reported from Costa Rica in 1960 and one rostral saw
from Trinidad and Tobago in 1944 (Faria et al., 2013). Several whole individuals and one rostrum were
recorded from Guyana in 1958 and 1960. There are also several other undated specimens recorded from
Guyana from this period (Faria et al., 2013). There are other records of smalltooth sawfish's presence in
the western Atlantic Ocean but specific information is lacking. For example, Faria et al. (2013) report that 4
rostral saws came from Mexico and two from Belize. One female was reported from Venezuela and two
rostra from Trinidad and Tobago. Despite lacking date information, the GBIF Database and Fishbase have
reports of smalltooth sawfish throughout South and Central America: French Guiana (48), Mexico (9),
Guyana (6), Venezuela (3), Haiti (2), and individual records from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Belize.

In summary, while records are sparse, it is likely the distribution of smalltooth sawfish in the Atlantic Ocean
is patchy and has been reduced in a pattern similar to largetooth sawfish. Data suggests only a few viable
populations might exist outside the United States. The Caribbean Sea may have greater numbers of
smalltooth sawfish than other areas given high quality habitats and reduced urbanization. For example,
smalltooth sawfish have been repeatedly reported along the western coast of Andros Island, Bahamas
(R.D. Grubbs, Florida State University pers. comm. to J. Carlson, NMFS, 2014) and The Nature
Conservancy noted two smalltooth sawfish at the northern and southern end of the island in 2006. Fishing
guides commonly encounter smalltooth sawfish around Andros Island while fishing for bonefish and
tarpon (R.D. Grubbs pers. comm. to J. Carlson, NMFS, 2014), and researchers tagged two in 2010
(Carlson et al., 2013). In Bimini, Bahamas, generally one smalltooth sawfish has been caught every two
years as part of shark surveys conducted by the Bimini Biological Station (D. Chapman pers. comm.to
Carlson, NMFS). In West Africa, Guinea Bissau represents the last areas where sawfish can be found (M.
Diop pers. comm. to IUCN, 2012). Anecdotal reports indicate smalltooth sawfish may also be found in
localized areas off Honduras, Belize, and Cuba (R. Graham, Wildlife Conservation Society, pers. comm. to
IUCN, 2012).

Peer Review and Public Comments

In December 2004, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Final Information Quality
Bulletin for Peer Review pursuant to the Information Quality Act (IQA). The Bulletin was published in the
Federal Register on January 14, 2005 (70 FR 2664). The Bulletin established minimum peer review
standards, a transparent process for public disclosure of peer review planning, and opportunities for public
participation with regard to certain types of information disseminated by the Federal Government. The
peer review requirements of the OMB Bulletin apply to influential or highly influential scientific information.
The proposed rule and included status review were considered influential scientific information under this
policy and subject to peer review. Similarly, a joint NMFS/FWS policy (59 FR 34270; July 1, 1994) requires
us to solicit independent expert review from at least three qualified specialists, concurrent with the public
comment period, on the science that is the basis for listing decisions. To ensure this final rule was based
on the best scientific and commercial data available, we solicited peer review comments from three
scientists familiar with elasmobranchs.

On June 4, 2013, we published a proposed rule to list as endangered five species of sawfish: Narrow
sawfish (A.

[Page Number 73994]

cuspidata ), dwarf sawfish (P. clavata), largetooth sawfish (P. pristis), green sawfish (P. zijsron), and the
non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata), that occurs outside U.S. waters, and opened a 90-day
public comment period (78 FR 33300). In the proposed rule, we stated that we were not proposing to
designate critical habitat for any of the five species because they occur outside U.S. waters. During our
comment period we received a request to extend the public comment period by 45 days. On August 7,
2013, we published a notice extending the public comment period by 45 days (78 FR 48134). We received
a total of four public comments.

In the following sections of the document we summarize and respond to the comments received from the
public and peer reviewers on the proposed rule.

Peer Review Comments

Comment 1: One commenter noted that the section of the proposed rule addressing protective efforts did
not include details on the Sawfish Conservation Strategy developed by the IUCN Shark Specialist Group.
The commenter stated that the strategy is a protective effort and will improve the conservation status of

Page40of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.sawfishes worldwide. The commenter predicted a medium to high certainty that the actions identified in
the Conservation Plan, when implemented, will be effective.

Response: We have included the IUCN Sawfish Conservation Strategy in the Protective Efforts section of
this final rule. The Services established two basic criteria in the PECE for evaluating conservation efforts:
(1) The certainty that the conservation efforts will be implemented, and (2) the certainty that the efforts will
be effective. We evaluated the IUCN Sawfish Conservation Strategy and determined it does not meet
either criterion identified in the PECE. The strategy identifies actions for countries to develop regulations
or adopt management actions to implement the strategy. However, the strategy does not legally bind any
country to enact laws or regulations, fund conservation actions, or otherwise implement the strategy. We
believe there is considerable uncertainty that the actions identified in the strategy will be adopted by the
various countries within the range of the five species of sawfish, and that resources are limited to support
these actions. Therefore, we cannot find that the strategy will decrease extinction risk for any of the
species.

Comment 2: One commenter stated that the Protective Efforts section of the proposed rule did not include
national protective efforts except for the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES). The commenter stated that sawfish protections in Australia were likely effective,
but protections in India were likely ineffective.

Response: We updated the Protective Efforts section of the rule and included the new information on
sawfish protections and conservation efforts in Australia from the Australian Government's recently
published 2014 Draft Recovery Plan for Sawfish and River Sharks (Department of Environment, 2014).
We also included updated information on existing laws in Australia and India designed to protect
sawfishes into the Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms section of this final rule.

Comment 3: It was suggested we use information in Kyne et al. (2013) to update the occurrence
information for P. clavata.

Response: We appreciate the new information and updated the occurrence information in the preceding
sections. The information did not impact our evaluation of the status of P. clavata.

Comment 4: We received a question about the origin of the 1996 record of dwarf sawfish from the Mekong
River Basin, Laos.

Response: We cite Rainboth (1996) for this report from the early 1900s that assumed the dwarf sawfish
was from the Mekong River Basin, Laos. We acknowledge no specimen exists to confirm this report.

Comment 5: The validity of narrow sawfish reports from Tasmania by Deynat (2005) was questioned in
one comment given the cold, temperate waters that do not support sawfish. The commenter suggested
the record of the sawfish specimen in the fish collection of CSIRO in Hobart, Tasmania was erroneous.

Response: We reviewed the literature and agree with the commenter. We removed the reference to
reports of narrow sawfish in Tasmania.

Public Comments

Comment 1: One commenter requested we cite a more recent reference for the information on the supply
and demand of sawfish than the 1996 reference in the proposed rule. Specifically, the commenter
questioned the statement that "sawfishes are in high demand throughout the world for display" and
suggested that sawfishes are no longer in high demand for display in aquaria.

Response: We updated our information on the aquaria trade of sawfishes on current supply and demand
of sawfishes in the Scientific and Educational Uses section and removed the statement cited by the
commenter. Although we believe that sawfish are still in high demand in the aquaria trade, we recognize
that the recent inclusion of all sawfishes under CITES Appendix I limits the use of sawfish for display and
requires acquisition of animals for aquaria from captivity or captive breeding.

Comment 2: Several commenters stated that they were concerned about the impacts of including "injuring
or killing a captive sawfish through experimental or potentially injurious veterinary care or conducting
research or breeding activities on captive sawfish, outside the bounds of normal animal husbandry
practices" in the list of activities that could result in a violation of the ESA Section 9 prohibitions. The
concerns relate to the impacts on captive propagation and rearing programs being conducted by aquaria,
and on the use of the latest advanced technological techniques available for captive held animals. The
commenters requested clarification that fish care and husbandry techniques could continue to be used by
aquaria.

Page41of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Response: As stated in the proposed rule, sawfish held in captivity at the time of listing are afforded all of
the ESA protections and may not be killed or injured or otherwise harmed, and, therefore, must receive
proper care. We realize that the care of captive animals necessarily entails handling or other manipulation
and we do not consider such activities to constitute injury or harm to the animals so long as adequate
care, including veterinary care, is provided. Such veterinary care includes confining, tranquilizing, and
anesthetizing sawfishes when such practices, procedures, or provisions are necessary and not likely to
result in injury.

On the effective date of a final listing, ESA Section 9 take prohibitions automatically apply for species
listed as endangered and any `take' of the species is illegal unless that take is authorized under a permit
or through an incidental take statement. Incidental take statements result from ESA Section 7
consultations on the effects of federal activities. ESA Section 10 permits can authorize directed take (e.g.,
for scientific research or enhancement of the species) or incidental take during an otherwise lawful activity
that would not be subject to ESA section 7 consultation. ESA Section 10 permits are issued to entities or
persons subject to the

[Page Number 73995]

jurisdiction of the United States. We encourage institutions with captive sawfish who are considering
activities outside the bounds of normal animal husbandry (e.g., breeding or research) to contact NMFS
Office of Protected Resources, Permits and Conservation Division, to determine if an ESA Section 10
permit is required to authorize the proposed activity. We do not have information regarding emerging
advances in fish care and animal husbandry for sawfish held in captivity so we cannot determine at this
time if they are outside the bounds of normal care for captive animals.
Comment 3: Several commenters requested clarification of the meaning of the terms "non-commercial"
and "non-commercially" as those terms are used in the section titled Identification of those Activities that
Would Constitute a Violation of Section 9 of the ESA.
Response: Section 3 of the ESA defines the term "commercial activity" to mean "all activities of industry
and trade, including but not limited to, the buying and selling of commodities and activities conducted for
the purposes of facilitating such buying and selling: Provided, however, That it does not include exhibitions
of commodities by museums or similar cultural or historical organizations." NMFS will use the definition of
"commercial activity" to evaluate whether an activity is "non-commercial" or a sawfish is being held
"non-commercially" in captivity.

Our listing determinations and summary of the data on which it is based, with the incorporated changes,
are presented in the remainder of this document.

Species Determinations

We first consider whether the narrow sawfish (A. cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (P. clavata), largetooth sawfish
(P. pristis), green sawfish (P. zijsron), and of the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata) meet
the definition of "species" pursuant to section 3 of the ESA. Then we consider if any populations meet the
DPS criteria.

Consideration as a "Species" Under the Endangered Species Act
Based on the best available scientific and commercial information described above in the natural history
sections for each species, we have determined that the narrow sawfish (A. cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (P.
clavata), largetooth sawfish (P. pristis), and green sawfish (P. zijsron) are taxonomically- distinct species
and therefore eligible for listing under the ESA. The largetooth sawfish (P. pristis) now includes the
formerly recognized species P. microdon and the previously listed P. perotteti. The decision to list P.
pristis will replace our 2011 listing determination for P. perotteti.

Distinct Population Segments

In order to determine if the petitioned and currently non-listed population segment of smalltooth sawfish
(P. pectinata) constitutes a "species" eligible for listing under the ESA, we evaluated it under our joint
NMFS- USFWS Policy regarding the recognition of distinct population segments (DPS) under the ESA (61
FR 4722; February 7, 1996). We examined the three criteria that must be met for a DPS to be listed under
the ESA: (1) The discreteness of the population segment in relation to the remainder of the species to
which it belongs; (2) the significance of the population segment to the remainder of the species to which it
belongs; and (3) the population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing
(i.e., Is the population segment, when treated as if it were a species, endangered or threatened?).

A population may be considered discrete, if it satisfies one of the following conditions: (1) It is markedly
separated from other populations of the same taxon as a consequence of physical, physiological,

Page42of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.ecological, or behavioral factors; or (2) it is delimited by international governmental boundaries within
which differences of control of exploitation, management of habitat, conservation status, or regulatory
mechanisms exist that are significant in light of section 4(a)(1)(D) of the ESA.

We previously determined that smalltooth sawfish in the United States merited protection as a DPS and
listed the U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish as endangered (68 FR 15674; April 1, 2003). At that time, there
was no information available to indicate smalltooth sawfish in U.S. waters interact with those in
international waters or other countries, suggesting that the U.S. population may be effectively isolated
from other populations. However, there were few scientific data on the biology of smalltooth sawfish, and it
was not possible to conclusively subdivide this species into discrete populations on the basis of genetics,
morphology, behavior, or other biological characteristics. Because there were no identified mechanisms
regulating the exploitation of this species anywhere outside of the United States, we considered that lack
of protection as directly relevant to the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms and a basis for
considering the U.S. population as discrete across international boundaries.

We now evaluate the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish to determine if it meets the discreteness
criteria of the joint DPS policy. First, we determine whether the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish
is discrete from the U.S. population because it is delimited by international governmental boundaries
within which differences of control of exploitation, management of habitat, conservation status, or
regulatory mechanisms exist that are significant in light of section 4(a)(1)(D) of the ESA. Because we have
designated critical habitat for the U.S. DPS population of smalltooth sawfish, there is a significant
regulatory mechanism for protecting smalltooth sawfish and their habitats in the United States that does
not exist for the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish. Movement data from smalltooth sawfish tagged
in U.S. and Bahamian waters also indicate no movement to countries outside where they were tagged.
This information provides support that the non-U.S. population is discrete from the already-listed U.S. DPS
on the basis of being markedly separate as a consequence of ecological factors, in addition to our
previous determination that the U.S. DPS is discrete on the basis of international boundaries and
significant differences in regulatory mechanisms. For smalltooth sawfish outside the U.S., we have no
information regarding genetic or other biological differences that would provide a strong basis for further
separating the non-U.S. smalltooth sawfish population into smaller, discrete units. We, therefore, conclude
that the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish meets the discreteness criterion of the joint DPS policy
and we consider this population as a single potential DPS.

We next must consider whether the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish meets the significance
criterion. The joint DPS policy gives examples of potential considerations indicating the population's
significance to the larger taxon. Among these considerations is evidence that the discrete population
segment would result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon. Smalltooth sawfish are limited in their
distribution outside of the United States to West Africa, the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South
America. Loss of this group of smalltooth sawfish would result in a significant gap in the range of this
species and restrict distribution to U.S. waters. Because the loss of smalltooth sawfish in areas outside the
United States would result in a

[Page Number 73996]

significant gap in the range of the species, we conclude the non-U.S. population of smalltooth sawfish is
significant as defined by the DPS policy.

Based on the above analysis of discreteness and significance, we conclude that the non-U.S. population
of smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata) meets the definition of a DPS and is eligible for listing under the ESA,
and hereafter refer to it as the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish.

Extinction Risk

Our updated extinction risk analysis provides a more detailed discussion of the extinction risk analysis
process that we used to determine the risk of extinction for narrow sawfish, dwarf sawfish, green sawfish,
largetooth sawfish, and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish to determine whether the species are
threatened or endangered per the ESA's definitions. We used an adaptation of the approach, including the
primary concepts, developed by Wainwright and Kope (1999) to organize and summarize our findings.
This approach was originally developed for salmonids and has been adapted and applied in the review of
many other species (Pacific salmonid, Pacific hake, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Puget Sound rockfishes,
Pacific herring, and black abalone) to summarize the status of the species according to demographic risk
criteria. The approach is useful when there is insufficient quantitative data to support development of
population viability models to investigate extinction risk and it allows the incorporation of sparse and
qualitative data. Wainwright and Kope (1999) identified key demographic parameters that have a strong
bearing on extinction risk, with a focus on risks to small populations from genetic effects and population
dynamics. Using these concepts, adapted to the biology of these sawfishes and our available data, we
estimated the extinction risk, based on demographic factors, for each of the five species under both

Page43of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.current threats and threats expected in the foreseeable future. We also performed a threats assessment
by identifying the severity of threats that exist now and in the foreseeable future.

We defined the "foreseeable future" as the timeframe over which threats, or the species' response to those
threats, can be reliably predicted to impact the biological status of the species. We determined that the
foreseeable future is approximately three generation times, calculated for each of the species based on
the demographic calculations of Moreno Iturria (2012): Narrow sawfish, 14 years; dwarf sawfish, 49 years;
largetooth sawfish, 48 years; green sawfish, 38 years; and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish, 30
years. After considering the life history of each species, availability of data, and type of threats, we
concluded that three generations was an appropriate measure to evaluate threats in the foreseeable
future. As a late-maturing species, with slow growth rate and low productivity, it would take more than one
generation for any conservation management action to be realized and reflected in population abundance
indices. The timeframe of three generations is a widely used scientific indicator of biological status, and
has been applied to decision making models by many other conservation management organizations,
including the American Fisheries Society, the CITES, and the IUCN.

We considered three demographic categories in which to summarize available data and assess extinction
risk of each sawfish species: (1) Abundance, (2) population growth rate/productivity, and (3) genetic
integrity which include the connectivity and genetic diversity of the species. We determined the extinction
risk for each category, for both now and in the foreseeable future, using a five level qualitative scale to
describe our assessment of the risk of extinction. At the lowest level, a factor, either alone or in
combination with other factors, is considered "unlikely" to significantly contribute to risk of extinction for a
species. The next lowest level is considered to be a "low" risk to contribute to the extinction risk, but could
contribute in combination with other factors. The next level is considered a "moderate" risk of extinction for
the species, but in combination with other factors contributes significantly to the risk of extinction. A
ranking of "high" risk means that factor by itself is likely to contribute significantly to the risk of extinction.
Finally, a ranking of "very high" risk means that factor is considered "highly likely" to contribute significantly
to the risk of extinction.

We ranked abundance as high or very high risk which is likely to contribute significantly to the current and
foreseeable risk of extinction for all five species. While it appears the northern coast of Australia supports
the largest remaining groups of dwarf, largetooth, green, and narrow sawfish in the Pacific and Indian
Ocean, data from the Queensland, Australia Shark Control Program show a clear decline in sawfish catch
(non-species-specific) over a 30-year period from the 1960s. In addition, it shows the complete
disappearance of sawfish in southern regions (Stevens et al., 2005). The available data on abundance of
sawfishes indicates there are still some isolated groups of sawfish in the western and central Indo-Pacific
region, but their abundance has likely declined from historic levels. Smalltooth sawfish are still being
reported outside of U.S. waters in the Caribbean Sea, but records are few and mostly insular (e.g., Andros
Island) where habitat is available and gillnet fisheries are not a threat to the species (see below). There
are only four records of largetooth sawfish in the eastern Atlantic Ocean over the last decade. In the
western Atlantic, recent largetooth sawfish records are from only the Amazon River basin and the Rio
Colorado-Rio San Juan area in Nicaragua.

Wainright and Kope (1999) stated short- and long-term trends in abundance are a primary indicator of
extinction risk. These trends may be calculated from a variety of quantitative data such as research
surveys, commercial logbook or observer data, and landings information when accompanied by effort, but
there is an absence of long-term monitoring data for all five sawfishes. We looked at the available data
closely to see if we could support inferences about extinction risk based on the trends in past observations
using the presence of a particular species at specified places and times (e.g., Dulvy et al., 2003;
Rivadeneira et al., 2009). The available museum records, negative scientific survey results, and anecdotal
reports do indicate the abundance trend for all five sawfishes is declining and population sizes are small.
Information available on the species' distribution indicates the species' ranges have also contracted. In
many areas where sawfish still occur, they are subject to commercial and artisanal fisheries and potential
habitat loss. We therefore ranked the risk of extinction posed by the sawfishes' abundances as high, now
and into the foreseeable future.

We next considered the species' potential growth rates and productivity as measures of their ability to
recover from depleted levels and provide inherent protection against extinction risk. Sawfish have
historically been classified as having both low reproductive productivity and low recovery potential. The
demography of smalltooth and largetooth sawfish from the northwest Atlantic Ocean that was originally
investigated using an age-structured life table (Simpfendorfer, 2000). Using known estimates of growth,
mortality, and reproduction at the time, Simpfendorfer (2000) determined that intrinsic rates of

[Page Number 73997]

population increase ranged from 8 to 13 percent per year, and population doubling times were
approximately 5 to 8.5 years for both species. These estimates included assumptions that there was no

Page44of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.fishing mortality, no habitat limitations, no population fragmentation, or other effects of small population
sizes. Simpfendorfer (2006) further modeled the demography of smalltooth sawfish using a method for
estimating the rebound potential of a population by assuming that maximum sustainable yield was
achieved when the total mortality was twice that of natural mortality. This demographic model produced
intrinsic rates of population increase that were from two to seven percent per year for both smalltooth and
largetooth sawfish. These values are similar to those calculated by Smith et al. (2008) using the same
methodology corresponding to elasmobranch species with the lowest productivity. Musick et al. (2000)
noted that species with intrinsic rates of increase of less than 10 percent were particularly vulnerable to
rapid population declines and a higher risk of extinction.

Some recent studies on the life history of sawfish, however, indicate they are potentially more productive
than originally proposed. Growth rates (von Bertalanffy "K") for some species, like narrow sawfish,
approach 0.34 per year (Peverell, 2008). Data from tag-recapture studies and analysis of vertebral growth
bands from smalltooth sawfish indicate that the first few years after birth represent the time when growth is
most rapid (e.g., Simpfendorfer et al., 2008; Scharer et al., 2012). Using updated life history information,
Moreno Iturria (2012) calculated intrinsic rates of increase for these five species of sawfish and
determined values ranging from a low of 0.02 per year for green sawfish to a high of 0.27 per year for
narrow sawfish with dwarf sawfish being second highest at 0.10 per year. Considering this information,
and the inferred declining trend in abundance, we conclude productivity is a moderate risk for the narrow
sawfish but a high risk for the other four species. We also determined that productivity would remain a
moderate risk for the narrow sawfish and is a high risk for the other four species, in the foreseeable future.

We also assessed the species' extinction risk, based on genetic diversity, spatial structure and
connectivity. Population structure and levels of genetic diversity have recently been assessed for the
green sawfish, dwarf sawfish, and largetooth sawfish across northern Australia using a portion of the
mtDNA control region. Phillips et al. (2011) found statistically significant genetic structure within species
and moderate genetic diversity among these species. These results suggest that sawfish may be more
vulnerable to local extirpation along certain parts of their range, especially in areas where the population
has been fragmented and movement between these areas is limited. However, these results do not
necessarily suggest a higher risk of extinction throughout the entire range of the species. Chapman et al.
(2011) investigated the genetic diversity of the U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish that has declined to
between one percent to five percent of its abundance at the turn of the twentieth century, while its core
distribution has contracted to less than 10 percent of its former range (NMFS, 2009). Surprisingly, given
the magnitude of this population decline and range contraction, the U.S DPS of smalltooth sawfish does
not exhibit any sign of genetic bottlenecks, and it has genetic diversity that is similar to other, less depleted
elasmobranch populations (Chapman et al., 2011). Given that all five species of sawfish considered here
have suffered similar abundance declines, we believe this conclusion should serve as a surrogate for the
other sawfish species. Because the U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish has not undergone a genetic
bottleneck, we ranked genetic diversity as a moderate risk for all sawfish species as it is likely, in
combination with other factors, to contribute significantly to the risk of extinction. However, we determined
that the risk of extinction due to the lack of connectivity was high for all five species, primarily because all
populations have undergone severe fragmentation. While genetic results provide optimism for the
remaining populations of sawfish, this does not preclude the promotion of management actions to
enhance connectivity among populations that have been historically fragmented. We are also somewhat
optimistic that sawfish populations may begin to rebuild in some areas and the risk of connectivity was
determined to decrease for smalltooth and the narrow sawfish in the foreseeable future, although by only a
small amount.

After reviewing the best available scientific data and assessing the extinction risk on the five species of
sawfishes based on their status and demography, we conclude the risk of extinction for all five species of
sawfish is high.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Five Species of Sawfishes

Next we consider whether any of the five factors specified in section 4(a)(1) of the ESA are contributing to
the extinction risk of these five sawfishes.

The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range

We identified destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range as a potential threat to all five
species of sawfishes and determined this factor is currently, and in the foreseeable future, contributing
significantly to the risk of extinction of these species.

Coastal and Riverine Habitats

Loss of habitat is one of the factors determined to be associated with the decline of smalltooth sawfish in
the U.S. (NMFS, 2009). As juveniles, sawfishes rely on shallow nearshore environments, primarily

Page45of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.mangrove-fringed estuaries as nurseries (e.g., Wiley and Simpfendorfer, 2010; Norton et al., 2012).
Coastal development and urbanization have caused these habitats to be reduced or removed from many
areas throughout the species' historic and current range. Habitat loss was identified as one of the most
serious threats to the persistence of all species of sawfish, posing high risks for extinction. It is still unclear
how anthropogenic perturbations to habitats affect the recruitment of juvenile sawfish, and therefore
adequate protection of remaining natural areas is essential. Given the threat from coastal urbanization
coupled with the predicted reduction of mangroves globally (Alongi, 2008), we believe the risk of habitat
loss would significantly contribute to both the decline of sawfish and their reduced viability.

We expect habitat modification throughout the range of these sawfishes to continue with human
population increases. As humans continue to develop rural areas, habitat for other species, like sawfish,
becomes compromised (Compagno, 2002b). Habitat modification affects all five species of sawfish,
especially those inshore, coastal habitats near estuaries and marshes (Compagno and Last, 1999;
Cavanagh et al., 2003; Martin, 2005; Chin et al., 2010; NMFS, 2010). Mining and mangrove deforestation
severely alter the coast habitats of estuaries and wetlands that support sawfish (Vidthayanon, 2002;
Polhemus et al., 2004; Martin, 2005). In addition, riverine systems throughout most of these species'
historical range have been

[Page Number 73998]

altered or dammed. For example, the potential expansion of the McArthur River Mine would permanently
realign channels that would in turn affect the number of pools formed during the wet and dry seasons,
many of which are used as refuge areas for dwarf, green, or largetooth sawfish (Polhemus et al., 2004;
Gorham, 2006). In addition to the potential expansion of the McArthur River Mine, the Nicaragua
government is proposing to build a cross-country canal through habitats currently used by the remaining
largetooth sawfish population in Lake Nicaraugua (BBC News, Latin America and Caribbean, 2013).

Although the status of habitats across the global range of these sawfishes is not well known, we expect
the continued development and human population growth to have negative effects on habitat, especially to
nearshore nursery habitats. For example, Ruiz-Luna et al. (2008) acknowledge that deforestation of
mangrove forests in Mexico has occurred from logging practices, construction of harbors, tourism, and
aquaculture activities. Valiela et al. (2001) reported on mangrove declines worldwide. They showed that
the area of mangrove habitat in Brazil decreased from 9652 to 5173 square miles (24,999 to 13,398
square kilometers) between 1983 and 1997, with similar trends in Guinnea-Bissau 1837 to 959 square
miles (4758 to 2484 square kilometers) from 1953 to 1995. The areas with the most rapid mangrove
declines in the Americas included Venezuela, Mexico, Panama, the U.S., and Brazil. Along the western
coast of Africa, the largest declines have occurred in Senegal, Gambia, Sierra Leone, and
Guinnea-Bissau. World-wide mangrove habitat loss was estimated at 35 percent from 1980 to 2000
(Valiela et al., 2001). These areas where mangroves are known to have decreased are within both the
historic and current ranges of these five species.

Hydroelectric and Flood Control Dams

Hydroelectric and flood control dams pose a major threat to freshwater inflow into the euryhaline habitats
of sawfishes. Alterations of flow, physical barriers, and increased water temperature affect water quality
and quantity in the rivers, as well as adjacent estuaries that are important nursery areas for sawfish.
Regulating water flow affects the environmental cues of monsoonal rains and increased freshwater flow
for pupping (Peverel, 2008; Morgan et al., 2011). Changes in siltation due to regulated water flow may
also affect benthic habitat or prey abundance for these sawfishes (Compagno, 2002; Polhemus et al.,
2004; Martin, 2005; Thorburn et al., 2007; Chin et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2010a).

New dams being proposed to provide additional irrigation to farmland upstream may affect sawfish habitat.
For example, the Gilbert River, in Queensland, Australia drains into the Gulf of Carpentaria, which is the
nursery area for green, dwarf, and largetooth sawfish. Further modification of the McArthur and Gilbert
Rivers, along with increased commercial fishing in coastal waters, will negatively affect sawfishes by
reducing available habitat while increasing bycatch mortality (Gorham, 2006).

Water Quality

Largetooth sawfish in particular, and likely the other sawfishes, have experienced a loss of habitat
throughout their range due to the decline in water quality. Agriculture and logging practices increase
runoff, change salinity, and reduce the flow of water into freshwater rivers and streams that affects the
habitat of the largetooth sawfish (Polhemus et al., 2004; IUCN Red List, 2006); mining seems to be the
most detrimental activity to water quality. Pollution from industrial waste, urban and rural sewage,
fertilizers and pesticides, and tourist development all end up in these freshwater systems and eventually
the oceans. Pollution from these operations has caused a reduction in the number of sawfish in these
freshwater systems (Vidthayanon, 2002; Polhemus et al., 2004).

Page46of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In summary, habitat alterations that potentially affect sawfishes include commercial and residential
development; agricultural, silvicultural, and mining land uses; construction of water control structures; and
modification to freshwater inflows. All sawfishes are vulnerable to a host of habitat impacts because they
use rivers, estuaries, bays, and the ocean at various times of their life cycle. Based on our review of
current literature, scientific surveys and anecdotal information on the historic and current distribution, we
find that destruction, modification, and curtailment of habitat or ranges are a factor affecting the status of
each species. We conclude that this factor is contributing, on its own or in combination with other factors,
to the extinction risk of all five species of sawfishes.
Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes
We identified overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes as a potential
threat to all five species of sawfishes and determined that it is currently and in the foreseeable future
contributing significantly to their risk of extinction.
Commercial Fisheries
Commercial fisheries pose the biggest threat to these sawfishes, as these species are bycatch from
many fisheries. Their unusual morphology and prominent saw makes sawfishes particularly vulnerable to
most types of fishing gear, most notably any type of net (Anak, 2002; Hart, 2002; Last, 2002; Pogonoski et
al., 2002; Cavanagh et al., 2003; Porteous, 2004; Stevens et al., 2005; Gorham 2006; IUCN Red List,
2006; Chidlow, 2007; Field, 2009; Chin et al., 2010; NMFS, 2010; Morgan et al., 2011). Trawling gear is of
particular concern as it is the most common gear used within the range and habitat of sawfishes
(Compagno and Last, 1999; Taniuchi, 2002; Walden and Nou, 2008). In Thailand, all sawfish fins obtained
and sold to markets are a result of bycatch by otter-board trawling and gillnet fisheries as there are no
directed sawfish fisheries in the country (Pauly, 1988; Vidthayanon, 2002). The Lake Nicaragua
commercial fishery for largetooth sawfish that collapsed prior to the 1980's was comprised mostly of
gillnet boats (Thorson, 1982a), and the commercial small coastal shark fishery in Brazil mainly uses
gillnets and some handlines (Charvet-Almeida, 2002). Subadult and adult smalltooth sawfish have been
reported as bycatch in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic shrimp trawl fishery (NMFS SEFSC,
2011); however, if proper techniques are used, all sawfish species, particularly adults, are fairly resilient
and can be released alive from most fishing gear (Lack et al., 2009).
Live release of sawfishes from commercial fishing gear does occur but sawfishes are often retained. The
meat is generally consumed locally, but the fins and rostra are of high value and sold in markets where
these products are unregulated (CITES, 2007). In Brazil, a captured sawfish is most likely retained
because of the value of their products, as the rostra, rostral teeth, and fins are valued at upwards of
$1,000 U.S. in foreign markets (NMFS, 2010a). The proportion of largetooth sawfish in these markets is
unknown, although as many as 180 largetooth sawfish saws were annually sold at a single market in
northern Brazil in the early 2000's (McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida, 2004). The Trade Records Analysis of
Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC) organization found that meat, liver oil, fins, and skin are among
the most

[Page Number 73999]

preferred sawfish products in Asian markets (Anak, 2002; Vidthayanon, 2002). In the Gulf of Thailand,
over 5,291 US tons (4,800 tonnes) of rays were caught annually from 1976 to 1989; at the same time over
1,102 US tons (1,000 tonnes) of rays were caught in the Andaman Sea (Vidthayanon, 2002). It is likely
that most of these products were sold in Asian markets because of the high demand for sawfish products.
Reports of sawfish products in various markets throughout Asia are often inconsistent and inaccurate
despite international rules on trade and possession of sawfish products (Fowler, 2002; Clarke et al., 2008;
Kiessling et al., 2009).
Recreational or commercial fishing gear may be abandoned or lost at sea. These "ghost nets" are an
entanglement hazard for sawfishes and have become an increasing problem in the Gulf of Carpentaria
where over 5,500 ghost nets were removed in 2009. Sawfish captures are expected to occur in regions
where no quantitative information about ghost nets exists (Gunn et al, 2010).

Misidentification, general species-composition grouping, and failure to record information are all concerns
for reporting sawfish captures in direct or indirect commercial fisheries (Stobutzki et al., 2002b). With little
enforcement of regional and international laws, the practice of landing sawfishes may continue (NMFS,
2010a). All sawfish populations have been declining worldwide, partly due to the negative effects of
commercial fishing (Stevens et al., 2000; Peverell, 2008).

Recreational Fisheries

Sawfish are bycatch of many recreational fisheries throughout their range, even in areas where they are
protected, including many Australian rivers (Walden and Nou, 2008; Field et al., 2009). Peverell (2008)

Page47of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.reports that some sawfish are a target sport fish for recreational fishermen in the Gulf of Carpentaria,
Queensland. Historical information from the U.S. indicates that recreational hook and line fishers in Texas
sometimes target large sharks as trophy fish but may capture sawfish (Burgess et al., 2009). Elsewhere in
the United States, the abundance of sawfishes is low and likely never high enough for recreational fishers
to encounter sawfish, much less target it (NMFS, 2010a). With the increase in human population along the
coast, recreational fishing has the potential to put additional pressure on sawfish species that use coastal
habitats (Walden and Nou, 2008).

Indigenous Take

Due to the large populations of various indigenous people throughout the range of these five species, and
the lack of data on the animals they harvest, the number of sawfish taken by local peoples is unknown.
Elasmobranchs are caught for consumption throughout the Indo-Pacific. In some areas, the meat and fins
of these animals are of high market value, and therefore they are sold rather than consumed locally. Due
to this unregulated consumption, removal of elasmobranchs, which includes sawfishes, is a threat to their
population(s) (Compagno and Last, 1999; Pogonoski et al., 2002; Vidthayanon, 2002; Thorburn et al.,
2007; Peverell, 2008; Morgan et al., 2010a).

Some studies have been conducted on the use and value of elasmobranch parts to various indigenous
groups, particularly those in eastern Sabah, Malaysia. One study (Almada-Villela, 2002) found the majority
of natives from Pulau Tetabuan and Pulau Mabul only take what is necessary for subsistence. Sawfish
rostra are also valued and kept as decoration or given as gifts at the expense of the animal
(Almada-Villela, 2002; McDavitt et al., 1996; Vidthayanon, 2002).

Protective Coastal Nets

Protective gillnets to prevent shark attacks on humans is used in some areas but can have a negative
impact due to bycatch. Sawfishes are highly susceptible to capture in nets because their saws are easily
tangled in nets. The Queensland Shark Control Program in Australia places nets along beaches during the
summer months. From 1970 to 1990, sawfish bycatch in these nets declined despite relatively constant
effort; likely due to an overall decline in sawfish populations (Stevens et al., 2005). In South Africa, the first
protective gillnets lined the southeast tip of the continent's coast as early as 1952. By 1990, over 27 mi (44
km) of nets lined the area between Richards Bay and Mzamba (Dudley and Cliff, 1993). About 350 sharks
and rays were captured in these nets between 1981 and 1990. A high percentage of entangled sawfish
are released alive because of their ability to breathe while motionless. Dudley and Cliff (1993) reported
that 100 percent of largetooth sawfish and 67 percent of smalltooth sawfish caught during that time were
released alive. Still, subsequent mortality post-release due to stress or injury from the process is unknown
and potentially detrimental given other fishing pressures (Dudley and Cliff, 1993).

Scientific and Educational Uses

Sawfishes are unique animals that are currently on public display in many large aquariums. Removal of
sawfishes from their natural habitats has caused some concern for these sawfish species and their
ecosystems. No information is available on the level of mortality that occurs during the capture and
transporting of live sawfish to aquaria. Removal of female sawfish from the wild could have an effect on
the future reproductive capacity of that population (Anak, 2002; Harsan and Petrescu-Mag, 2008). Limited
information is available regarding the number of sawfish that have been removed from the wild for display
in aquaria. All sawfish removed from Australian waters for aquaria collections have been reported as
juveniles (S. Olson, Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), 2013 pers. comm). The two most recent
imports of largetooth sawfish to an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) accredited facility were in
2007 and 2008 (S. Olson, AZA, 2013 pers. comm).

In July 2011, the Australian CITES Scientific Authority for Marine Species reviewed their 2007
non-detriment finding for the export of P. microdon and found that it was not possible to conclude with a
reasonable level of certainty that any harvest for export purposes would not be detrimental to the survival
or recovery of the species (DSEWPaC, 2011). Since then, international trade in freshwater sawfish from
Australia has ceased.

Worldwide, we are not aware of any narrow sawfish in captivity (Peverell, 2005, 2008). We are aware of 2
dwarf sawfish held in captivity in Japan (McDavitt, 2006). Largetooth sawfish are the most common
sawfish species in captivity (NMFS, 2010a). Juvenile largetooth measuring less than 3.5 ft (1 m) TL on
average are most often caught for the aquaria trade as they are easier to transport than adults (Peter and
Tan, 1997).

Globally, scientists are collecting information on sawfish biology. Research efforts began in 2003 on the
U.S. DPS population of smalltooth sawfish and no negative impacts have been associated with this
research to date.

Page48of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.In summary, while no quantitative data on fishery impacts are available, we conclude that given the
susceptibility of sawfish to entanglement in gillnets and trawl nets that are commonly used throughout their
range, sawfishes are likely captured as incidental take. We are not aware of any fisheries

[Page Number 74000]

specifically targeting sawfishes. This impact from fisheries is the most likely single cause of the observed
range contractions and reduced abundance in many areas of their former range. Trade of sawfish parts
occurs throughout the world. Sawfish have been exploited for their fins, rostra, and teeth. Sawfish fins
have been report in the shark fin trade since the early 1900s (Mountnorris, 1809). Trade of sawfish parts
occurs on Internet sites such as eBay and Craigslist. Trade of sawfish parts (e.g., fins, rostral teeth, and
rostra) are also ongoing threats to all five species (Harrison et al., 2014). Therefore, we conclude the
overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, alone or in combination
with other factors as discussed herein, is contributing significantly to the risk of extinction of the narrow,
dwarf, largetooth, green, and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish.

Disease and Predation

We have determined that disease and predation are not potential threats to any of the five species of
sawfish and that it is unlikely that these factors, on their own or in combination with other factors, are
contributing significantly to their risk of extinction of all five sawfish species.

These species co-occur with other sawfishes and large sharks, but we are not aware of any studies or
information documenting interspecific competition in terms of either habitat or prey (NMFS 2010a).
Thorson (1971) speculated that the Lake Nicaragua bull shark population may compete with largetooth
sawfish, as both were prevalent, but he offered no additional data. Sawfish have been documented within
the stomach of a dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) near Bermuda (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1953; Monte-Luna
et al., 2009), in the stomach of a bull shark (C. leucas) in Australia (Thorburn et al., 2004), and evidence of
bite marks from what appeared to be a bull shark (C. leucas) on a juvenile smalltooth sawfish in the United
States have been reported (T. Wiley-Lescher, Haven Worth Consulting, 2012 pers. comm). Crocodiles
also prey on sawfishes (Cook and Compagno, 2005). There is no evidence that unusual levels of disease
or predation affect any of the five sawfish species. Based on the information available on disease and
predation for all five species of sawfish, we have determined that disease and predation on their own, or in
combination with other factors, do not pose an extinction risk to any of these sawfishes.

Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms

We identified inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms as a potential threat to each of the five
species of sawfish. We determined that this factor alone, or in combination with other factors, is
contributing significantly to their risk of extinction.

First, we reviewed general or global regulatory protections for sawfish. The use of turtle exclusion devices
(TEDs) in the nets of trawl fisheries to conserve sea turtles occurs throughout much of the range of
sawfishes, but TEDs are not efficient in directing sawfish out of nets because sawfish rostra get entangled
(Stobutzki et al., 2002a; Brewer et al., 2006) prior to reaching the TED. TEDs are often used when trawling
occurs along the sea bottom at depths of 49 ft to 131 ft (15 to 40 m), areas where sawfish are likely to be
found (Stobutzki et al., 2002a). Most sawfishes show no difference in recovery after going through a trawl
net, regardless of the presence or absence of a TED (Griffiths, 2006). Stobutzki et al. (2002a) found that
large females are more likely to survive capture after passing through a trawling net and TED compared to
smaller males. Only narrow sawfish were found to benefit from the presence of TEDs in nets as 73.3
percent escaped (Brewer et al., 2006; Griffiths, 2006). In general, TEDs tend to have negligible impact on
sawfish that get captured by trawling nets (Stobutzki et al., 2002a; Griffiths, 2006), but they do provide an
escape route if the animal does not get entangled.

Data reporting agencies (i.e., customs and national fisheries) are often inconsistent in their reporting of
wildlife trade (Anak, 2002). Reports are often vague and include general descriptions like "shark fin" or
"ray," providing practically no information of trading rates of specific products (Lack and Sant, 2011). Many
countries in the Indo-Pacific do not report bycatch statistics or elasmobranchs taken illegally (Holmes et
al., 2009). In order for effective management plans to be implemented in fin markets and for sawfish
product trade, data need to be consistent.

Next, we reviewed regional or country specific regulatory protections for sawfish. Many countries in the
Indo-Pacific and the Middle East do not have formal legislation for management or national protection of
the sawfish that may occur in their waters. Presently, Thailand has regulated some fisheries, but has no
protective legislation for any elasmobranch in the country except for export of marine species for aquaria
(Vidthayanon, 2002). Among Middle Eastern countries that fish for sharks, only Iran has implemented an
International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA Shark Plan). Nine

Page49of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Arab countries have recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory
Sharks to improve shark conservation measures under the United Nations Environment Programme
Convention on Migratory Species. Countries in Africa face similar circumstances as enforcement for
sawfish protection is unknown (NMFS, 2010a). Countries that do have protective legislation are often
unable to effectively patrol their waters, and fishing restrictions are routinely violated by foreign vessels
(Lack. and Sant, 2008). In one study, genetic testing (DNA barcoding) was used to identify fins from green
sawfish confiscated from foreign boats illegally fishing in northern Australian waters (Holmes, 2009).

The Australian government listed the largetooth, green, and dwarf sawfishes as vulnerable on their
Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act list. The EPBC Act protects these
sawfish and prohibits killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping, or moving an individual without a permit.
Even with these protections in place, the Draft Recovery Plan for Sawfish and River Sharks (Department
of the Environment, 2014) reports that these three sawfish species have experienced substantial
population declines.

In summary, several organizations are trying to regulate and manage sawfish but often these regulations
and management initiatives are inadequate. Illegal exploitation by foreign fishers often occurs when
regulations exist but are not enforced (Kiessling et al., 2009). Preventative measures on existing fishing
mechanisms to avoid sawfish catch, international monitoring of trade and bycatch, and governmental
influence on fisheries are not presently sufficient to protect sawfishes. Specific regulation and monitoring
of sawfishes by country would provide better protection (Vidthayanon, 2002; Walden and Nou, 2008).
Therefore, we conclude the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms has and continues to
significantly contribute to the risk of extinction of the narrow, dwarf, largetooth, green, and the non-U.S.
DPS of smalltooth sawfish.

Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence

In the proposed rule, we determined this was not a factor contributing

[Page Number 74001]

significantly to the risk of extinction of all five species of sawfish. We re- evaluated the information for this
factor and changed our conclusion from the proposed rule based on the fact that sawfish life history traits,
which consists of slow growth rates, late maturity, long life spans, and low fecundity rates. These life
history traits do not enable them to respond rapidly to additional sources of mortality, such as
overexploitation and habitat degradation. Scientific information available on all five species of sawfish
indicates that other natural or manmade factors are potential threats to all of the five species of sawfish.
We conclude it is likely that these factors, on their own or in combination with other factors, are
contributing significantly to the risk of extinction for all five sawfish species.

An increase in global sea-surface temperature and sea level may already be influencing sawfish
populations (Clark, 2006; Walden and Nou, 2008; Chin et al., 2010). Fish assemblages are likely to
change their distribution and could affect the prey base for sawfishes. Estuaries, including sawfish pupping
grounds, may be affected as climate change changes patterns in freshwater flow due to rainfall and
droughts. Skewed salinities in these areas or extreme tide levels might discourage adults from making
up-river migrations (Clark, 2006). Saltwater marsh grass and mangrove areas play important roles in
sawfish habitat as well (Simpfendorfer et al., 2010); any disruption to these areas may affect sawfish
populations. There is little agreement, however, on the effects that climate change will have on sawfish
and their environments specifically (Clark, 2006; Chin et al., 2010).

Red tide is the common name for a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of marine algae (Karenia brevis) that can
make the ocean appear red or brown. Karenia brevis is one of the first species ever reported to have
caused a HAB and is principally distributed throughout the Gulf of Mexico, with occasional red tides in the
mid- and south-Atlantic United States. Karenia brevis naturally produces a brevetoxin that is absorbed
directly across the gill membranes of fish or through ingestion of algal cells. While many HAB species are
nontoxic to humans or small mammals, they can have significant effects on aquatic organisms. Fish
mortalities associated with K. brevis events are very common and widespread. The mortalities affect
hundreds of species during various stages of development. Red tide toxins can cause intoxication in fish,
which may include violent twisting and corkscrew swimming, defecation and regurgitation, pectoral fin
paralysis, caudal fin curvature, loss of equilibrium, quiescence, vasodilation, and convulsions, culminating
in death. However, it is known that fish can die at lower cell concentrations and can also apparently
survive in much higher concentrations. In some instances, mortality from red tide is not acute, but may
occur over a period of days or weeks after exposure to subacute toxin concentrations. There is no specific
information on red tide effects on sawfish, but a single report exists of a smalltooth sawfish that was found
dead along the west coast of Florida, during a red tide event (International Sawfish Encounter Database,
2009). Therefore, we conclude that sawfishes occurring in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are vulnerable to red
tide, but there is little information documenting direct mortality resulting from exposure to red tide (NMFS,

Page50of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.2010a). Harmful algal blooms also exist in waters outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico therefore, it is
probable that all sawfishes are vulnerable to harmful algal blooms wherever they occur. Collectively, these
other natural or manmade factors may be affecting the continued existence of the narrow, dwarf,
largetooth, green, and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish. Based on the results from our extinction
risk analysis and information on other man-made factors affecting all five species of sawfish, this factor is
contributing to their extinction risk.

Overall Risk Summary

After considering the extinction risks, both threat-based and demographic, for each of the five species of
sawfish, we have determined the narrow, dwarf, largetooth, and green sawfish and the non-U.S. DPS of
smalltooth sawfish are in danger of extinction throughout all of their ranges due to (1) present or
threatened destruction, modification or curtailment of habitat, (2) overutilization for commercial,
recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, (3) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and
(4) other natural or manmade factors affecting their continued existence, and low abundance, lack of
connectivity, and genetic diversity.

Protective Efforts
Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the ESA requires the Secretary, when making a listing determination for a species, to
take into consideration those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation to protect the
species. In judging the effectiveness of efforts not yet implemented, or those existing protective efforts that
are not yet fully effective, we rely on the Services' joint "Policy for Evaluation of Conservation Efforts When
Making Listing Decisions" ("PECE"; 68 FR 15100; March 28, 2003). The PECE policy is designed to
ensure consistent and adequate evaluation on whether any conservation efforts that have been recently
adopted or implemented, but not yet proven to be successful, will result in recovering the species to the
point at which listing is not warranted or contribute to forming the basis for listing a species as threatened
rather than endangered. The purpose of the PECE policy is to ensure consistent and adequate evaluation
of future or recently implemented conservation efforts identified in conservation agreements, conservation
plans, management plans, and similar documents when making listing determinations. The PECE
provides direction for the consideration of conservation efforts identified in these documents that have not
yet been implemented, or have been implemented but not yet demonstrated effectiveness. The policy is
expected to facilitate the development of conservation efforts by states and other entities that sufficiently
improve a species' status so as to make listing the species as threatened or endangered unnecessary.

Two basic criteria were established in the PECE to use in evaluating efforts identified in conservations
plans, conservation agreements, management plans or similar documents: (1) The certainty that the
conservation efforts will be implemented; and (2) the certainty that the efforts will be effective. When we
evaluate the certainty of whether or not the formalized conservation effort will be implemented, we may
consider the following: Do we have a high level of certainty that that the resources necessary to carry out
the conservation effort are available? Do the parties to the conservation effort have the authority to carry it
out? Are regulatory or procedural mechanisms in place to carry out the efforts? If the conservation effort
relies on voluntary participation, we will evaluate whether the incentives that are included in the
conservation effort will ensure the level of participation necessary to carry out the conservation effort. In
evaluating the certainty that a conservation effort will be effective, we may consider the following: Does the
effort describe the nature and extent of the threats to the species to be addressed and how these threats
are reduced by the conservation effort? Does the effort establish specific conservation objectives? Does
the effort

[Page Number 74002]

identify the appropriate steps to reduce the threats to the species? And does the effort include quantifiable
performance measures to monitor both compliance and effectiveness? Overall, we need to be certain that
the formalized conservation effort improves the status of the species at the time we make a listing
determination. The PECE Policy also states that last-minute agreements (i.e., those that are developed
just before or after a species is proposed for listing) often have little chance of affecting the outcome of a
listing decision. Last-minute efforts are also less likely to be able to demonstrate that they will be
implemented and effective in reducing or removing the threats to a species. In addition, there are
circumstances in which the threats to a species are so imminent and/or complex that is will be almost
impossible to develop an agreement or plan that includes conservation efforts that will result in making the
listing unnecessary. A conservation effort that satisfies the criteria for implementation and effectiveness is
considered when making a listing determination, but may not ultimately change the risk assessment for
the species. Using the criteria identified in our PECE Policy we evaluated conservation efforts to protect
and recover the five sawfish species that are either underway but not yet fully implemented, or are only
planned.

Page51of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.CITES restricts the trade of live animals to a vast array of wildlife products derived from them, including
food products, musical instruments, tourist curios and medicines. Many wildlife species in trade are not
endangered, but the existence of an agreement to ensure the sustainability of the trade is important in
order to safeguard these resources for the future. All sawfishes in the family Pristidae were listed on
Appendix I of CITES at the 14th Conference of the Parties meeting in 2007. An Appendix I listing bans all
commercial trade in parts (e.g., rostral teeth, rostra, liver, and fins) or derivatives of sawfish with trade in
specimens of these species permitted only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., for research purposes). At
that time, an annotation to the Appendix I listing allowed the largetooth sawfish P. microdon (herein P.
pristis) to be treated as Appendix II "for the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals
to appropriate and acceptable aquaria for primarily conservation purposes." The annotation was accepted
on the basis that Australian populations of P. microdon were robust relative to other populations in the
species' range, and that the capture of individuals for aquaria was not likely to be detrimental to the
population. Later, at the CITES 16th Annual Conference of the Parties meeting in March of 2013, Australia
proposed the transfer of P. microdon from Appendix II to Appendix I, and the measure was adopted and
became effective on 12 June 2013. Therefore, live trade of P. pristis (P. microdon) is currently banned and
all commercial trade of all sawfishes is banned per CITES Appendix I listing.

The recent banning of all trade of P. pristis (P. microdon) for aquaria trade is a good conservation
measure for the species and meets all of the criteria for implementation and effectiveness. The recently
adopted CITES Appendix I listing for largetooth sawfish only bans the live trade of the fish from Australia
to approved foreign aquaria, all other trade was banned with the 2007 listing. Only 11 largetooth sawfish
were approved for aquaria trade when the largetooth sawfish was listed under CITES Appendix I with the
annotation for aquaria trade. The recent CITES Appendix I listing for largetooth sawfish is not likely to
significantly affect the species outside of the limited area (Australia) where they were removed from the
wild for aquaria display. Given live trade of P. pristis (P. microdon) for aquaria use is not a threat leading to
the extinction risk of the species, we conclude the full CITES Appendix I listing may satisfy the PECE
policy's standards for implementation and effectiveness, but the impact of this measure is considered
insignificant. Australia may be effective at enforcing trade policies, but the recent Appendix I listing of P.
microdon (largetooth sawfish) alone, is not sufficient to protect the species throughout its range.
The IUCN Shark Specialist Group, in collaboration with a large number of the national and international
stakeholders in sawfish conservation, developed A Global Strategy for Sawfish Conservation (Harrison
and Dulvy, 2014). The strategy identifies the actions required to achieve recovery for all sawfishes. The
strategy outlines seven objectives that are necessary to achieve recovery of all sawfishes: Fisheries
management, species protection, habitat conservation, trade limitation, strategic research, education and
communication, and responsible husbandry. We evaluated the certainty of whether or not the strategy
would be implemented and determined that (1) the strategy does not have a high level of certainty that the
resources necessary to carry out the conservation effort are available, (2) that the strategy team members
do not have the authority to carry out all of the objectives, (3) regulatory or procedural mechanisms are not
in place to carry out the objectives, (4) and the conservation efforts rely on voluntary participation that
does not have incentives that are included in the conservation effort that will ensure the level of
participation necessary to effectively carry out the conservation effort. Based on the lack of certainty that
the conservation efforts will be implemented we determined the strategy does not satisfy the PECE
policy's standards for certainty of implementation and effectiveness.

The Australian Government, Department of the Environment, published a Draft Recovery Plan for Sawfish
and River Sharks (Plan) in 2014 (Department of Environment, 2014). The Draft Plan covers three sawfish
species (P. pristis, P. zijsron, and P. clavata). The Plan identifies specific actions and objectives necessary
to stop local decline of sawfish and river sharks and promotes their recovery. The goal of the Draft Plan is
to assist with the recovery of sawfish in Australian waters in two ways: (1) Improving the population status
leading to the removal of the sawfish from the protected species list of EPBC; and (2) ensuring
anthropogenic actives do not hinder the recovery in the near future, or impact the conservation status of
the species in the future. We evaluated the certainty of whether or not the Draft Plan would be
implemented. We determined that the strategy has a high level of uncertainty regarding implementation
because: (1) The Draft Plan does not have dedicated funding so the resources necessary to carry out the
conservation efforts may not be available, and (2) the Draft Plan is dependent on the participation of
voluntary groups or organizations (e.g., indigenous community groups and non-governmental
organizations) to carry out some of the actions. Based on the lack of certainty that the Draft Plan will be
implemented, we determined the Draft Plan does not satisfy the PECE policy's standards for certainty of
implementation and effectiveness.

Listing Determinations
Section 4(b)(1) of the ESA requires that we make listing determinations based solely on the best scientific
and commercial data available after conducting a review of the status of the species and taking into
account those efforts, if any, being made by any state or foreign nation, or political subdivisions thereof, to

Page52of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.protect and conserve the species. We have reviewed the best available scientific and commercial
information including the petition, and the information in the

[Page Number 74003]

review of the status of the five species of sawfishes, and we have consulted with species experts.

We are responsible for determining whether narrow sawfish (A. cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (P. clavata),
largetooth sawfish (P. pristis), green sawfish (P. zijsron), and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (P.
pectinata) are threatened or endangered under the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). We have followed a
stepwise approach as outlined above in making this listing determination for these five species of sawfish.
We have determined that narrow sawfish (A. cuspidata); dwarf sawfish (P. clavata); largetooth sawfish (P.
pristis); green sawfish (P. zijsron); and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata) constitute
species as defined by the ESA. We have conducted an extinction risk analysis and concluded that the risk
of extinction for all five species of sawfish is high, now and in the foreseeable future. We have assessed
the threats affecting the status of each species using the five factors identified in section 4(a)(1) of the
ESA and concluded the narrow, dwarf, largetooth, green, and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish face
ongoing threats from habitat alteration, overutilization for commercial and recreational purposes,
inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and other natural or manmade factors affecting their
continued existence throughout their ranges. Therefore, we find that all five species of sawfishes are in
danger of extinction throughout all of their ranges. After considering efforts being made to protect these
sawfishes, we could not conclude the proposed conservation efforts would alter the extinction risk for any
of these five sawfishes.

Effects of Listing

Conservation measures provided for species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA include
recovery actions (16 U.S.C. 1533(f)); Federal agency requirements to consult with NMFS and to ensure its
actions do not jeopardize the species or result in adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat
should it be designated (16 U.S.C. 1536); designation of critical habitat if prudent and determinable (16
U.S.C. 1533(a)(3)(A)); and prohibitions on taking (16 U.S.C. 1538). An additional benefit of listing beyond
these legal requirements is that the recognition of the species' plight through listing promotes conservation
actions by Federal and state agencies, foreign entities, private groups, and individuals.

Recovery Plans

NMFS may develop a recovery plan or plans for these species after considering the conservation benefit
to the species per ESA sections 4(f)(1) and 4(f)(1)(A). Section 4 (f)(1) of the ESA directs NMFS to develop
and implement recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, unless we find that such
a plan will not promote the conservation of the species. Section 4(f)(1)(A) further directs us, to the
maximum extent practicable, to give priority in developing plans to those species that will most likely
benefit from such plans.

Identifying Section 7 Consultation Requirements

Section 7(a)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)) of the ESA and NMFS/USFWS regulations require Federal
agencies to consult with us to ensure that activities authorized, funded, or carried out are not likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. The
requirement to consult applies to these Federal agency actions in the United States and on the high seas.
The five sawfishes all occur in the waters of foreign nations, where there would be no consultation
requirement. It is possible, but highly unlikely, that the listing of the five species of sawfish under the ESA
may result in a minor increase in the number of Section 7 consultations for high seas activities.

Critical Habitat

Critical habitat is defined in Section 3 of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1532(5)) as: (1) The specific areas within the
geographical area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the ESA, on which are
found those physical or biological features (a) essential to the conservation of the species and (b) that
may require special management considerations or protection; and (2) specific areas outside the
geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed upon a determination that such areas are
essential for the conservation of the species. Critical habitat shall not be designated in foreign countries or
other areas outside U.S. jurisdiction (50 CFR 424.12 (h)).
The best available scientific and commercial data show that the geographical areas occupied by the
narrow sawfish (A. cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (P. clavata), green sawfish (P. zijsron), largetooth sawfish (P.
pristis), and the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata) are entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction, so
we cannot designate critical habitat for these species in their occupied range.

Page53of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.We can designate critical habitat in unoccupied areas in U.S. jurisdiction, if we determine the areas are
essential for the conservation of the species. Only the largetooth sawfish (P. pristis, formerly P. perotteti)
has a range that once included occasional use of U.S. waters, with approximately 39 confirmed records
(33 in Texas) from 1910 through 1961. All records of P. pristis in U.S. waters were adults, mostly during
the summer months. U.S. waters were a limited part of the historic range, likely used for periodic, seasonal
foraging movements. There is no evidence of U.S. waters supporting any other biological functions like
breeding or nursery areas. Therefore, we believe reestablishment back into U.S. waters is not required for
the recovery of P. pristis. Based on the best available information we have not identified unoccupied areas
in U.S. jurisdiction that are essential to the conservation of any of the five sawfish species. Therefore, we
do not intend to designate critical habitat for the narrow, dwarf, largetooth, green, or the non-U.S. DPS of
smalltooth sawfish.

Identification of Those Activities That Would Constitute a Violation of Section 9 of the ESA

On July 1, 1994, NMFS and FWS published a policy (59 FR 34272) that requires us to identify, to the
maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed, those activities that would or would not
constitute a violation of section 9 of the ESA. Because we are listing all five sawfishes as endangered, all
of the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the ESA will apply to all five species. These include prohibitions
against the import, export, use in foreign commerce, and "take" of the species. Take is defined as "to
harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any
such conduct." These prohibitions apply to all persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,
including in the United States or on the high seas. The intent of this policy is to increase public awareness
of the effects of this listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species' range. Activities that we
believe could result in a violation of Section 9 prohibitions of these five sawfishes include, but are not
limited to, the following:

(1) Take within the U.S. or its territorial sea, or upon the high seas;

(2) Possessing, delivering, transporting, or shipping any sawfish part that was illegally taken;

(3) Delivering, receiving, carrying, transporting, or shipping in interstate or

[Page Number 74004]
foreign commerce any sawfish or sawfish part, in the course of a commercial activity, even if the original
taking of the sawfish was legal;
(4) Selling or offering for sale in interstate commerce any sawfish part, except antique articles at least 100
years old;

(5) Importing or exporting sawfish or any sawfish part to or from any country;

(6) Releasing captive sawfish into the wild. Although sawfish held non- commercially in captivity at the
time of listing are exempt from certain prohibitions, the individual animals are considered listed and
afforded most of the protections of the ESA, including most importantly the prohibitions against injuring or
killing. Release of a captive animal has the potential to injure or kill the animal. Of an even greater
conservation concern, the release of a captive animal has the potential to affect wild populations of
sawfish through introduction of diseases or inappropriate genetic mixing. Depending on the circumstances
of the case, NMFS may authorize the release of a captive animal through a section 10(a)(1)(a) permit; and

(7) Engaging in experimental or potentially injurious veterinary care or conducting research or breeding
activities on captive sawfish, outside the bounds of normal animal husbandry practices. Normal care of
captive animals necessarily entails handling or other manipulation of the animals, and NMFS does not
consider such activities to constitute take or harassment of the animals so long as adequate care,
including adequate veterinary care is provided. Such veterinary care includes confining, tranquilizing, or
anesthetizing sawfishes when such practices, procedures, or provisions are not likely to result in injury.
Captive breeding of sawfish is considered experimental and potentially injurious. Furthermore, the
production of sawfish progeny has conservation implications (both positive and negative) for wild
populations. Experimental or potentially injurious veterinary procedures and research or breeding activities
of sawfish may, depending on the circumstances, be authorized under an ESA 10(a)(1)(a) permit for
scientific research or the enhancement of the propagation or survival of the species.

We have identified, to the extent known at this time, specific activities that will not be considered likely to
result in a violation of Section 9. Although not binding, we consider the following actions, depending on the
circumstances, as not being prohibited by ESA Section 9:

Page54of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.(1) Take of a sawfish authorized by a 10(a)(1)(a) permit authorized by, and carried out in accordance with
the terms and conditions of an ESA section 10(a)(1)(a) permit issued by NMFS for purposes of scientific
research or the enhancement of the propagation or survival of the species;

(2) Incidental take of a sawfish resulting from Federally authorized, funded, or conducted projects for
which consultation under section 7 of the ESA has been completed, and when the otherwise lawful activity
is conducted in accordance with any terms and conditions granted by NMFS in an incidental take
statement in a biological opinion pursuant to section 7 of the ESA;

(3) Continued possession of sawfish parts that were in possession at the time of listing. Such parts may be
non-commercially exported or imported; however the importer or exporter must be able to provide
sufficient evidence to show that the parts meet the criteria of ESA section 9(b)(1) (i.e., held in a controlled
environment at the time of listing, non-commercial activity);

(4) Continued possession of live sawfish that were in captivity or in a controlled environment (e.g., in
aquaria) at the time of this listing, so long as the prohibitions under ESA section 9(a)(1) are not violated.
Again, facilities should be able to provide evidence that the sawfish were in captivity or in a controlled
environment prior to listing. We suggest such facilities submit information to us on the sawfish in their
possession (e.g., size, age, description of animals, and the source and date of acquisition) to establish
their claim of possession (see For Further Information Contact);

(5) Provision of care for live sawfish that were in captivity at the time of listing. These individuals are still
protected under the ESA and may not be killed or injured, or otherwise harmed, and, therefore, must
receive proper care. Normal care of captive animals necessarily entails handling or other manipulation of
the animals, and we do not consider such activities to constitute take or harassment of the animals so long
as adequate care, including adequate veterinary care is provided. Such veterinary care includes confining,
tranquilizing, or anesthetizing sawfish when such practices, procedures, or provisions are not likely to
result in injury; and

(6) Any importation or exportation of live sawfish or sawfish parts with all accompanying CITES import and
export permits and an ESA section 10(a)(1)(a) permit for purposes of scientific research or the
enhancement of the propagation or survival of the species.

Section 11(f) of the ESA gives NMFS authority to promulgate regulations that may be appropriate to
enforce the ESA. Future regulations may be promulgated to regulate trade or holding of sawfish, if
necessary. The public will be given the opportunity to comment on future proposed regulations.

Policies on Peer Review

In December 2004, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Final Information Quality
Bulletin for Peer Review establishing a minimum peer review standard. Similarly, a joint NMFS/FWS policy
(59 FR 34270; July 1, 1994) requires us to solicit independent expert review from qualified specialists,
concurrent with the public comment period. The intent of the joint peer review policy is to ensure that
listings are based on the best scientific and commercial data available. We formally solicited expert
opinion of three appropriate and independent specialists regarding the scientific and commercial data or
assumptions related to the information considered for listing.

We considered peer reviewer comments in making our determination. We conclude that these experts'
reviews satisfy the requirements for "adequate [prior] peer review" contained in the Information Quality
Bulletin for Peer Review and the joint NMFS/FWS policy (59 FR 34270; July 1, 1994).

Classification

National Environmental Policy Act
The 1982 amendments to the ESA, in section 4(b)(1)(A), restrict the information that may be considered
when assessing species for listing. Based on this limitation of criteria for a listing decision and the opinion
in Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus, 675 F. 2d 825 (6th Cir. 1981), NMFS has concluded that ESA listing
actions are not subject to the environmental assessment requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) (See NOAA Administrative Order 216-6).

Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act

Page55of304©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.As noted in the Conference Report on the 1982 amendments to the ESA, economic impacts cannot be
considered when assessing the status of a species. Therefore, the economic analysis

[Page Number 74005]

requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act are not applicable to the listing process. In addition, this final
rule is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866. This final rule does not contain a collection-of-
information requirement for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.

Executive Order 13132, Federalism

In accordance with E.O. 13132, we determined that this final rule does not have significant Federalism
effects and that a Federalism assessment is not required.
