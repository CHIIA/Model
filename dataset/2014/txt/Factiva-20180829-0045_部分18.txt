SYDNEY--Australian food producer Goodman Fielder Ltd. (GFF.AU) urged shareholders Wednesday to
accept a reduced takeover bid from Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. (F34.SG) and Hong Kong's
First Pacific Co. (0142.HK) that values the company at around 1.32 billion Australian dollars (US$1.25
billion).

The Asian bidders lowered their offer to 67.5 Australian cents a share from an earlier bid of 70
Australian cents after accessing Goodman Fielder's books. Goodman Fielder on Monday also
announced it would book a writedown of A$300 million-to-A$400 million for the current financial year
through June, mostly related to its Australia and New Zealand baking business.

Takeover interest in Australian food assets has surged in recent months, as bidders position themselves
for a rise in Asia's appetite for Western-style diets, and as the region's middle class grows more affluent.

Goodman Fielder manufactures some of Australia's most recognizable food brands, including Meadow
Lea margarine, Praise mayonnaise and Wonder White bread. Wilmar has been touted as a potential
buyer ever since it took a 10% stake in Goodman Fielder two years ago.

Wilmar and First Pacific originally offered 65 cents a share in April, a bid which was rejected as too low.

In May, the pair returned with a sweetened bid of 70 cents and gave Goodman Fielder directors 24
hours to decide whether to endorse the offer, which they did, conditional on completion of due diligence.
