The former chief operating officer of Chinese-owned Sinosteel Midwest Julian Mizera will spearhead
feasibility studies for the Mt Bevan iron ore project near Menzies.
It follows Mr Mizera’s appointment as chief executive of Perth-based Legacy Iron Ore this week,
bringing a wealth of experience after working on Sinosteel’s unsuccessful bid to develop the $2
billion Weld Range mine at the stalled Oakajee Port.

He will earn $260,000 per annum.

Mt Bevan – a 60:40 joint venture between Legacy and Hawthorn Resources – neighbours Jupiter
Mines’ Mt Mason project and is close to Mindax’s Mt Forrest project in the emerging Yilgarn iron ore
province.

Legacy’s managing director Sharon Heng said feasibility studies are the “next major step for the Mt
Bevan project”. “Julian will have responsibility for the development and progression of the Mt Bevan
project including the overseeing of any feasibility study work and as managing director I will continue
to oversee the corporate aspects of the company, including capital raisings and potential
acquisitions,” she said.
India’s State-run NMDC, which claims to be the world’s eighth-largest iron ore producer, holds a 48
per cent stake in Legacy.
