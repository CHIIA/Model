Shell Kicks Off 2014 Divestment Program

Royal Dutch Shell has kicked off its 2014 divestment program, netting $1.14 billion (A$1.3 billion) by
exiting Australia's $29 billion Wheatstone LNG project in a sale to Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Co.(Kufpec), the company announced Monday.
Meanwhile, the supermajor axed around half the jobs at its proposed $20 billion Arrow LNG development
Monday, one Shell source said, putting another Australian project in doubt as new Chief Executive Ben
van Beurden looks to cut Shell's losses on a number of high-margin projects following a disastrous 2013.

Europe's top oil company agreed to sell a 6.4% holding in the 8.9 million ton per year Wheatstone
project in northwest Australia and an 8% equity interest in two offshore gas fields which will feed the
facility. Kufpec, the international arm of Kuwait's national oil company, KPC, already has a 7% stake in
the Chevron-led project and will increase its equity interest by 570,000 tons per annum alongside the US
major, which has a 64.14% holding, Houston-based independent Apache with 13% and utility Kyushu
Electric with 1.46%. The remaining 8% is owned by joint venture PE Wheatstone, comprised of Japanese
quartet Mitsubishi, Tepco, NYK Line and Jogpec.
Since the Kuwait firm is an existing partner, Shell says the sale to Kufpec "ensures there will be no
impact on existing commercial agreements."

Wheatstone, which is expected to achieve first production by 2016, has already agreed deals for almost its
entire capacity with the world's top market in Northeast Asia. Japanese and South Korean buyers,
including the countries' largest, Tepco and Kogas, have agreed 20-year offtake deals totaling 8.4 million
tons annually.
In a crowded LNG environment in Australia's northeast, Arrow -- an 8 million ton/yr 50-50 joint venture
with Chinese state-owned PetroChina -- has yet to be sanctioned and industry watchers have suggested
it could be scrapped. Such rumblings received greater weight following reports that up to 600 jobs were
cut there on Monday. Gladstone, where the development is based, already has four other projects either
planned or under construction.
"Shell will remain a major player in Australia's energy industry," said van Buerden. "However, we are
refocusing our investment to where we can add the most value. We are making hard choices in our
world-wide portfolio to improve Shell's capital efficiency," he added. 
Last year Shell indicated it had set a 2014 divestment target of some $15 billion.

In an unprecedented profit warning last week, Shell put the blame for poor results last year on
"high-margin production including LNG" (IOD Jan.20'14). One analyst told International Oil Daily that
Shell's latest divestment decision made sense. 
"Following a path of least resistance, the sale to a project partner reduces any headaches, while [the
supermajor] is able to concentrate on LNG projects in which it has an operating capacity," the analyst
said.

In a separate statement on Monday, Shell also announced its upstream boss, Andy Brown, had stepped
down with immediate effect while he "recuperates from a recent medical procedure." The supermajor's
head of integrated gas, Maarten Wetselaar, formerly upstream finance head, will take over his
responsibilities. Brown's absence follows the sudden departure of the company's legal director, Peter
Rees, on Jan. 10.

for around 50% of Dutch output, will be cut by more than a quarter over the next three years, the country's
economics ministry said on Friday, following concern over earthquakes resulting from production. Shell
operates the field in a 50-50 joint venture with Exxon Mobil.

Monday shares stayed virtually flat, finishing trading 0.05% up at 2,175.5 pence on London-listed Shell,
recovering from a slow start, which saw the price drop 1.06%.
