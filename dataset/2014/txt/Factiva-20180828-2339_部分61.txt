LONDON--Newspaper and business publications group DAILY MAIL & GENERAL TRUST PLC
(DMGT.LN) Wednesday said its adjusted operating profit for the current financial year in one of its
divisions will be at the bottom end of market expectations after further delays with its new risk
management software product.

Shares at 0800 GMT down 58 pence, or 7.12%, at 756.5 pence.

Retailer JD SPORTS FASHION PLC (JD.LN) raised its interim dividend 3% after reporting a significant
jump in pretax profit for the first six months of the year, amid a strong performance in its sports and
outdoor division.

Shares up 12 pence, or 2.94%, at 420 pence.
African nickel and copper miner BELLZONE MINING PLC (BZM.LN) is still in loan talks with China
Sonangol International as well as other potential providers of longer term financing, as it warned that it
only has funding to continue operations until mid-September.

Shares down 0.14 pence, or 20%, at 0.55 pence.

Billing technology group BILLING SERVICES GROUP LTD. (BILL.LN) swung to a first-half pretax profit
but lowered its full-year revenue guidance as it continues to be affected by the decline in landline phone
billing. It expects full-year revenue to be $42.0 million to $45.0 million, modestly below levels projected
in prior guidance.

Shares down 0.25 pence, or 7.69%, at 3 pence.

Stock broker CENKOS SECURITIES PLC (CNKS.LN) reported an eight-fold rise in first-half pretax profit
to 23.5 million pounds ($38.1 million), amid economic recovery in the U.K. and strong equity market
trading conditions. Revenue rose to GBP65.2 million, from GBP20.0 million.

Shares up 29 pence, or 13%, at 245 pence.

FTSE Small-Cap up 0.18%

AIM down 0.05%
