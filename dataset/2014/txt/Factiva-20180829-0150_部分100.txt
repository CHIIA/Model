Singapore, Jan. 14 -- Herbert Smith Freehills has advised iBuy Group Limited (iBuy) on its initial public
offer on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX code: IBY).

iBuy is an e-commerce business focused on flash sales that sells discounted branded products to
consumers in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. Part of the proceeds of the offer were used to pay for
the acquisition of iBuy's key websites, including BeeCrazy.hk (Hong Kong), Deal.com.sg (Singapore),
Mydeal.com.my and Dealmates.com (Malaysia). Funds raised were also set aside for advertising and
marketing campaigns, anticipated future acquisition opportunities, working capital and costs of the offer.

The offer comprised 115.6 million iBuy shares at an offer price of $0.32 per share. The offer raised a total
of $37 million. iBuy also raised an additional $7 million through the issue of convertible notes prior to the
offer.
Canaccord Genuity (Australia) Limited was lead manager and underwriter to the offer.
Herbert Smith Freehills' global offices assisted iBuy with the offer and the acquisition of iBuy's key
websites. The project was led by Melbourne-based partner Michael Ziegelaar, with assistance from senior
associate Nick Golding and solicitor Betty Shao. Herbert Smith Freehills' Singapore and Hong Kong
offices provided valuable assistance with the acquisition of iBuy's businesses. The Singapore team was
led by partner Nicola Yeomans, with support from Nithia Dory and Eliza Coleman and the Hong Kong
team was led by partner Matt Emsley with support from Lorraine Yip.
The offering demonstrates the strength of the firm's integrated global offices and its Australian capital
markets platform.

"Herbert Smith Freehills is very pleased to assist iBuy with its initial public offering, including the
company's asset acquisitions and convertible note issue" said Michael Ziegelaar. "We wish iBuy every
success as an ASX-listed company."
