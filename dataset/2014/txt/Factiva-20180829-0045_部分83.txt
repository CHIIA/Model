Neither Panzhihua Iron & Steel Group (Pangang) nor its listed subsidiary intends to invest in any steel
project in Nigeria, an official from the Chinese steelmaker said Friday, saying his company’s finances
are already stretched with its investment in the Karara iron ore project in Western Australia.

Pangang’s official was responding to a Nigerian newspaper report on June 26 that quoted the permanent
secretary of Nigeria’s industry, trade and investment ministry, Abdulkadir Musa, as saying Pangang
Group agreed to invest $5 billion in a 4-5 million metric tons/year steel project in Nigeria.

"It is impossible!” Pangang’s official said Friday. “We are already making serious losses in Karara, so we
are very cautious about overseas projects nowadays, whether it is about iron ore or steel. Besides, $5bn
is not a small amount, where would we find the money?"
The Karara project, which once belonged to Anshan Iron & Steel Group (Angang), was transferred to
Pangang when Angang completed acquiring Pangang in 2011. The project is known to have faced
serious delays and investment blow-outs before it was commissioned in October 2012.

Pangang’s net profits last year plunged by about two thirds compared with 2011 before Angang’s
acquisition, according to its Shenzhen-listed subsidiary’s latest annual report.

A Beijing-based steel analyst also brushed off the Nigerian report. "Pangang is barely surviving itself with
the big hole in Karara, so the report is not making any sense at all,” he told Platts. “Neither Angang nor
Pangang can afford to invest into Africa for the time being.” Africa lacks infrastructure including road,
railways and ports, so any investments will face heavy expenditures in building such facilities, he added.
