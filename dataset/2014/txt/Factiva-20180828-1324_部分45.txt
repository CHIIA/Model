ROSEBERY miner MMG Limited has gained shareholder approval for a massive acquisition in
Peru.
Acquisition of the Las Bambas copper project was predicted in late June to cost $US5.85 billion.

Debt and equity contributions from joint venture partners MMG (62.5 per cent), a subsidiary of
Guoxin International Investment Co. Limited (22.5 per cent) and CITIC Metal Co. Limited (15 per
cent) will fund the purchase.
The acquisition would be transformational for MMG, CEO Andrew Michelmore said.
"Once completed, this transaction will mark a significant milestone in our company's history."
Shareholders approved the deal on Monday in Hong Kong.The company on Friday released
further details of Rosebery's June quarter performance.Year to date zinc production was down 12
per cent on the first half of 2013.
Copper production was up 57per cent on the same measure, while lead concentrate production
was 7 per cent down.

MMG said the lower production was due to geotechnical issues in parts of the intended mine plan.

Rosebery general manager Aaron Brannigan said the mine plan had been re-sequenced to target
higher grade zones of zinc and lead.
"I'm confident the revised mine plan for the second half of the year will regain some of those loses,"
he said.
