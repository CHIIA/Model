1355 GMT [Dow Jones] The mining sector has underperformed the wider Stoxx Europe 600 index in
each of the last three years. However Nomura reckons that this could all be set to change. Analysts note
that not only are free cashflow yields moving sharply upwards, but consensus earnings estimates have
seen a sign change and are also now moving north. Nomura forecasts that mining earnings in FY14 will
see an EPS increase of c.24% versus the wider market at c.14%. Analysts also argue that further upside
potential could stem from better input-cost pricing dynamics, weaker commodity currencies and improved
operational efficiency. Still, Nomura economists forecast a 30% likelihood of a "hard landing" in China,
somewhat tempering the outlook for the sector. Nomura upgrades its recommendation on the European
Metals & Mining sector to 'neutral' from 'bearish'. Nomura appears to be testing the water when
compared to Citi, which two weeks ago turned bullish on European miners for the first time in three years.
Nomura's top pick is BHP Billiton (BLT.LN) followed by Rio Tinto (RIO.LN)-- both rated at 'buy'.

1320 GMT [Dow Jones] BG Group (BG.LN) shares were in a spin Monday, falling by almost 15% after
the oil and gas company cut production guidance for 2014. The company has delivered four
downgrades to its production or earnings outlook over the past 18 months, further denting management
credibility. Credit Suisse reckons that a number of issues raised yesterday should already have been
known to management at the May or Sept 2013 updates, raising questions (yet again) over the
information flow within the organisation. Credit Suisse does upgrade its recommendation on the stock to
'neutral' from 'underperform', as it reckons there could be some valuation support at these levels. Still, the
bank argues that the future remains far from certain - while there are also tremendous uncertainties in the
'growth' drivers, Australia and Brazil. Meanwhile there's a sense of remorse in the air at JPMorgan, which
downgrades the stock to 'neutral' from 'overweight', adding that it is "too late" to cut another notch. JPM
reduces the price target to 1300p from 1550p, while Credit Suisse lowers its target to 1115p from 1200p.
BG shares drop (another) 1.1% to 1070p, Tuesday afternoon in London.(nina.bains@wsj.com; Twitter:

1241 GMT [Dow Jones] Morgan Stanley issues a rather cautious outlook on G4S (GFS.LN), noting that
trading conditions remain challenging for the security company. While 2014 is set be a transformational
year, execution risks remain high, warns Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, the "dispersed nature" of the
business and competitive end markets will likely mean that management action may take time to show
tangible benefits. "2014 will likely be a 'show-me' story and we see a risk of disappointment building
during 2014 unless trading conditions improve or there are real signs of benefits coming through from the
new strategy," says Morgan Stanley. Analysts initiate coverage of the stock at underweight with a price
target of 235p. Shares fall 1.7% to 246p Tuesday. (nina.bains@wsj.com; Twitter: @NinaBains1)

1218 GMT [Dow Jones] Jefferies says Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS.LN) announcement late Monday of
unexpected provisions and various conduct-related and litigation charges should not alter the investment
case on the stock. You might be surprised to learn, however, that Jefferies' investment thesis on RBS is

Page131of273©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.that it's a 'buy'. Jefferies' bullish stance is predicated on the value it says it recognises in core operations.
Analysts even go as far to say that the announcement was "helpful", as management has now provided
some numbers around litigation risks. In addition, the capital impact looks manageable and was already
factored into planning around the creation of the bad bank, Jefferies argues. Meanwhile, Investec
Securities urges would-be "value investors" to stay patient as it reckons a transformed low-risk, low-cost
UK retail/commercial bank will (eventually) be on its way. Investec upgrades its recommendation on the
stock to 'hold' from 'sell'. The market's clearly looking for reasons to be bullish (or just not to be bearish
on the stock perhaps) - RBS shares rise 1.3% to 337p lunchtime in London.(nina.bains@wsj.com;

1156 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares in cruise line operator Carnival (CCL.LN) rally 2.7% to 2544p in London
Tuesday after rival Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) reported 4Q revenue rose 2.7%, beating
expectations. FY14 guidance is also positive, which could bode well for Carnival. Numis Securities
reckons that Carnival's guidance may be upgraded when it reports 1Q numbers in early March, for two
key reasons: Carnival has greater scope for yield and earnings recovery than RCL after the 2013
incidents on Carnival Dream (generator failure at St Maarten) and Triumph (engine room fire, adrift in
Gulf of Mexico), and Carnival's geographic exposure is much more favourable than RCL. Carnival also
has lower exposure to the Caribbean, where pricing pressures exist (and where all its technical problems
seem to occur), while it also has a greater exposure to stronger markets like Europe, Alaska and Asia.
Numis upgrades Carnival to 'buy' from 'hold' and raises the target price to 3000p from 2250p.

1115 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares in F&C Asset Management (FCAM.LN) get a second wind Tuesday,
having rallied almost 25% the previous session, after the asset manager agrees a GBP 708 million
takeover offer from BMO Global Asset Management, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada's Bank of
Montreal. While F&C confirmed it was in talks with BMO about a possible offer Monday, the agreement to
the takeover Tuesday, alongside the company's 4Q IMS, serves to juice the stock for a second session.
Shore Capital says retail flow performance remained relatively good and institutional flows recovered
strongly. Meanwhile, the deal with BMO represents good value for F&C shareholders, adds Shore. Other
analysts also highlight that the length of time needed for regulatory approval could bring other potential
bidders into the arena. F&C shares add 4.8% Tuesday in London, to 122p.(nina.bains@wsj.com; Twitter:

1044 GMT [Dow Jones] Afren's (AFR.LN) trading statement Tuesday confirms a strong performance in
2013, as the oil and gas explorer delivered US $1.65 billion in revenues and over US $1.1 billion in
operating cash flow, notes BofA-ML. And investors should expect higher returns in 2014. Analysts note
that Afren will again likely spend in excess of US $200 million on E&A this year, including spudding
seven wells targeting more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent gross. There is the potential for further
exploration upside: in Kurdistan, a declaration of commerciality has been submitted on Simrit-3 whilst a
result on Maqlub-1 is expected near-term. BofA-ML rates the stock at 'buy' with a revised price objective
of 245p from 255p. Afren shares are among the strongest on London's FTSE 250 index today, up 4.6% to
152p. (nina.bains@wsj.com; Twitter: @NinaBains1)

1001 GMT [Dow Jones] UK's FTSE 100 index trades in the black, up 0.4% at 6576.54, staging a modest
recovery following four straight sessions of losses. UK GDP figures are in line with expectations and, as
such, pass with little fuss. Output in the economy grew 0.7% between October and December, down from
a 0.8% expansion rate in the two prior quarters. ARM Holdings is down 2.7%, sinking to the bottom of the
FTSE 100. The technology sector lags other sectors in Europe after Apple disappointed with 1Q results
late Monday. On the upside, shares in cruise operator Carnival rally 3.4% after an equity rating upgrade
and as rival Royal Caribbean 4Q revenue beat expectations. Trading is likely to remain rangebound
ahead of the next round of US data, with durable goods orders at 1330 GMT and consumer confidence at
1500 GMT, and as the two-day US FOMC meeting gets underway.(nina.bains@wsj.com; Twitter:
@NinaBains1)

0937 GMT [Dow Jones] Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS.LN) announcement late Monday of unexpected
provisions to cover a raft of litigation and conduct issues has raised major concerns over the bank's
capital. UBS notes that the group's core tier 1 ratio will now likely be at the low end of European banks,
and some 150bp below Lloyds (LLOY.LN) and Barclays (BARC.LN). Analysts reckon that this might raise
concerns over an equity capital raise. However, UBS says given the level of Government ownership, this
outcome will likely not happen at RBS. Instead, UBS thinks it is more likely that businesses will be
shrunk/sold to boost capital, forcing shareholders to accept dilution. News of extra PPI provisions at RBS
is negative for both Lloyds and Barclays, says UBS. In particular, at Lloyds a large additional PPI
provision could drive a statutory loss for the year and perhaps even prevent a dividend being paid in
respect of 2013, adds UBS. Analysts rate RBS at 'sell' with a price target of 300p. Somewhat
unexpectedly, RBS shares rise 1.8% to 338p in London this morning. (nina.bains@wsj.com; Twitter:

0919 GMT [Dow Jones] Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.LN) shares closed down over 2% Monday after
warning of a surprise GBP 3 billion provision and drop in its capital levels in its year-end results. The
bank also commented that it had "accelerated the bad bank sell-down ahead of plans". Bank of
AmericaMerrill Lynch says that it had modeled most of the losses announced for 4Q13 in its 2014-2015
estimates. While this might suggest it was simply a matter of timing, BofA-ML worries there may be
further balance sheet reduction/restructuring to be announced. Analysts note that Barclays (BARC.LN)
has already topped up its PPI and Swaps provisions significantly, alongside its rights issue, and as such
they expect no further losses there. However, there is a potential read across to Lloyds (LLOY.LN) on
PPI, reckons BofA-ML. Benchmarking Lloyds to RBS would imply a further GBP 900 million in charges
compared to GBP 1 billion embedded in BofA-ML's estimates. The bank rates RBS at 'underperform',
with a price objective of 280p. RBS trades +1.1% at 336p in London this morning.(nina.bains@wsj.com;
