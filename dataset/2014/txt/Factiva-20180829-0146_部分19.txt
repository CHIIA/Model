Melbourne's Liberman family are looking to capitalise on inner- Sydney's new light rail
infrastructure, and growing appetite for the city's residential development sites, and will sell a key
hectare of land in the inner suburb of Leichhardt.
The site, which could fetch more than $35 million, is located within 300 metres of Sydney's new
light railway. The $176 million extension of the inner-west light line will be in operation by the end of
March.

Colliers International's Guillaume Volz, who declined to comment on price, is marketing the
massive 10,130 square metre site, which is now zoned for up to 250 apartments.
"This site is in one of Sydney's most undersupplied markets," Mr Volz said, "There have only been
22 new apartments built in Leichhardt since 2009.

"This is also a classic example of a transport orientated development, whereby new infrastructure is
leading the way for significant new residential development in a prime area of inner Sydney."

Some of the surrounding suburbs in the inner west are already benefiting from increased values.

The suburb of Birchgrove saw its median house price grow 28.5 per cent in 2013. Developers such
as the Chinese QY Hansen have been actively buying residential development sites and are
expected to show strong interest in the Leichhardt land holding.
The Leichhardt site at 22 George Street is owned by JGL Investments as a clothing manufacturing
and warehouse facility for Kolotex.
Colliers is calling for expressions of interest. In 2013 the group sold more than $500 million worth
of residential sites across Sydney, feeding a developer frenzy.
