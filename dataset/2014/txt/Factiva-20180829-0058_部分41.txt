The S&P/ASX200 is up 1.7 points to 5410.7 at midday on lightish volume worth $1.6 billion. There are
399 issues higher and 414 down. The SPI Futures is down 1 point to 5416 on good volume of 12,336
contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 4 points to 3.68%. The $A is at 93.12 US c, down about 20
points from early levels.

Market expected to at least do a "dead cat bounce" today after yesterday's plunge, although a sharp watch
on China - and on the Aussie Budget outcome - is likely to keep investors sidelined, while traders including
technical traders are likely to benefit from volatility.

"I expect our market to fall another 10 points or so today"
"Maree" said, "I expect our market to fall another 10 points or so today. Apart from the fall in the iron ore
price weighing on our market, proposals to lift the age at which Australians could access their
superannuation savings is likely to worry investors. When people are unsure of what they may and may
not do they are likely to do nothing".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 70 points to 5409 last evening.

ECO NEWS

Minutes of the RBA Meeting held on May 6 - no early rate hike envisaged

"Members noted that there had been little change in the outlook for the global economy, with growth of
Australia's major trading partners in the year ahead still forecast to be around average. The latest data
received on the domestic economy had evolved much as expected, with further indications that growth had
picked up a little over the past two quarters. This had been driven by very strong exports as well as an
increase in the growth of consumption and dwelling investment.
"However, the Board noted that overall growth in coming quarters was likely to be below trend given
expected slower growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the planned fiscal consolidation.

While a range of indicators suggested that conditions in the labour market had improved in recent months,
the demand for labour remained subdued and was likely to remain so for some time. This had led to lower

Page132of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.wage growth, which in turn had seen inflation decline for non-tradable items whose prices were more
sensitive to labour costs.

"This was being offset by stronger inflation for tradable items as a result of the depreciation of the
exchange rate over the previous year. Inflation was consistent with the target and was forecast to remain
so over the next couple of years.
At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. The
expansionary setting of monetary policy continued to have the expected effects on economic activity.
Notably, a sustained increase in dwelling investment was in prospect, consumption had strengthened a
little and business conditions were around average levels. Recent developments had indicated that the
economy had evolved broadly in line with earlier expectations, resulting in little change in the updated
forecasts for activity and inflation. With growth in activity expected to pick up only gradually, and spare
capacity in the labour market consequently remaining for some time, growth in domestic costs was
forecast to remain contained, which would help to offset the ongoing effect on prices from the depreciation
of the exchange rate over the past year.

"Given this outlook for the economy and the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to
support economic activity, the Board considered that the current accommodative stance of policy was
likely to be appropriate for some time yet".

NEW LISTING

Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia Ltd (GMA) is trading at $2.99 on 74.6m shares in a gala debut,
lists on a deferred and conditional settlement basis after an offer of 220 million shares at a price of $2.65
a share for 650 million shares on issue, with the rest retained by the US parent company. Goldman
Sachs Australia Pty Ltd has been appointed stabilisation manager in connection with market stabilisation
arrangements. Twenty million shaer under the offer have been designated as over allocation shares.

Page133of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Genworth independent director and chairman of Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia Ltd said in the
covering letter to the prospectus, "Australia has experienced consistent GDP growth, sustained credit
growth, relatively low unemployment levels and net population growth over the last decade. Australia has a
well capitalised banking system which remains in a relatively strong position. .. The four Australian Major
Banks accounted for 78% of residential mortgage loans outstanding as at Decemebr 31 2013.. Genworth
Australia has consistently delivered profits through varied economic environments with pro forma net profit
after tax of $179 million and underlying NPAT of $221 million in full year 2013"..
"Property News' adds, "Goldman Sachs and CBA Equities, Macquarie and UBS launched a book build
last week following the decision of the US parent to sell down a 34% stake in its Australian subsidiary. It
has a 45% share of the lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) market in Australia, in an oligopoly as Genworth
and the other main player, QBE LMI, have a combined share of around 78%.
Genworth will raise about $750 million from the float, which was delayed two years ago, following heavy
losses in the local LMI arm.

"LMI covers lenders when borrowers default on their home loans. LMI is typically required by banks as a
result of pressure from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and their own boards for risk
mitigation when a borrower has less than 20% of the purchase price as a deposit.

"Mortgage insurance covers the lender – usually banks – with Genworth the largest Australian provider,
with more than 60% of its business coming from loans written by CBA, Westpac Banking Corporation and
National Australia Bank.
"Genworth said it expected to post a net profit of US$231 million ($248 million) for the year to 31
December, up from US$179 million in 2013.
"But CLSA analyst Jan van der Schalk told the AFR the company produces an 11% return on equity,
which is a “desperately poor return for a feast or famine business”.
"Goldman Sachs has estimated a property price correction of 10% would have a pre-tax impact of $870
million over a two to three year period.
"A hard landing for property prices – a fall of 30% – would have a pre-tax impact of $2.2 billion over two
to three years'.

LARGE CAP RESOURCES

*AWE/AUT/Others: Sharply lifts reserves and contingent resources in Sugarloaf

AWE Ltd announced it has increased its booked Reserves and Contingent Resources for the Sugarloaf
Area of Mutual Interest, located in the Eagle Ford unconventional shale play in Texas, USA following an
independent appraisal and report prepared by DeGolyer & MacNaughton.

The Sugarloaf AMI covers a number of leases totalling approximately 24,000 acres and AWE holds a 10%
working interest (approximately 2,400 acres).

The revisions result substantially from an updated Eagle Ford development plan wherein AWE assumes
Eagle Ford drilling will be at 40 acre well spacing rather than the previously assumed 60 acre spacing - the
operator has announced Eagle Ford drilling in certain areas at spacing as low as 30 acres, also the
re-categorising of a number of drilling locations upwards as a result of additional wells having been drilled
throughout the Sugarloaf AMI over the course of calendar 2013.

AWE managing director Bruce Clement lifted estimates in 1P, 2P, 3P reserves and 2C Contingent
Resources, booking an additional 7.7 million BOE in 2P reserves alone, which is greater than AWE's total
annual forecast production for 2013/14 of between 5/5.5 million BOE. In addition the report identified 13.2
MMBOE in 2C Contingent Resources in the Austin Chalk that could be developed over the next few years.
AWE 10%, AUT 28.1%, Empyrean Energy Plc 3%, Marathon Oil as operator 55%, Texas Crude Energy

Oi-1 is currently expected to spud during the last week of May, subject to the timing of the rig move. This is
a very significant well for PPP as the company has increased its interest from 15%t o 50% (j/.v parties

AWE 57.5% and operator, Pan Pacific Petroleum 15% (50% in Oi), NZO 27.5%).

*MKB: Has filed for listing on Nasdaq, no change in Australia

Page138of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Moko Social Media Ltd announced it has completed the confidential documentary submission process with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission and today publicly filed a Form F-1 Registration Statement
with the SEC.

F-1 Registration Statement, the document must remain in the public domain for 21 days. Following that
period MOKO intends to embark on an investor roadshow in the US with its investment banker and
underwriter Northland Capital Markets.

*RHL: Int u/lying NPAT up 57%, 8c ff div, no DRP/outlook positive

Ruralco Holdings Ltd for the half year ended March 31 2014 announced a net profit after tax of $5.1
million vs a loss of $500,000 for the prior corresponding period (pcp), for underlying NPAT of $8.5 million,
up 57% on the pcp. On revenue up 14% to $544.6 million.
Underlying EBITDA rose 34% to $22 million vs the pcp.
Gross profit of $115.5 million was up 16% on the pcp.

An 8c fully franked dividend was announced, record date June 6. The DRP is not available for this
dividend.
Cash in hand is $40.128 million vs $40.528 million for the pcp.

Basic and diluted eps is 8.4c vs 8.08c for the pcp.

Managing director John Maher said the improved first half was despite dry and hot seasonal conditions in
the first four months of the year.

He said the strategy of diversifying and extending the revenue base to provide some protection against
volatility in seasonal conditions and commodity prices is working to the company's advantage, including
an increased contribution from the water trading, water solutions and insurance segments as well as solid
performances from the more traditional rural supplies and agency activities.

Improved autumn rains in the southern cropping regions, increased market shares from greenfield stores
and sound margin management lifted rural supplies by 19%; livetock gross profit lifted 31%, delivered on
the strength of a 41% growth in cattle volumes and 12% growth in sheep volumes. Ruralco Water
increased volume traded by 505 on the pcp with irrigation activity in the market up to finish summer rice,
cotton and horticultural crops and increase milk output.
There were also good clearance rates for mainland regional residential and lifestyle properties. The
overall rural property market is also showing signs of improvement. The Real estate segment's gross
profit rose13% on the pcp.

Outlook

Mr Maher said early signs are encouraging for solid trading conditions, also international demand for
Australia's meat and other soft commodities continuing into the second half would have a positive effect for
all segments of the business.
Company guidance: On April 24 Ruralco Holdings Ltd advised it expects to report a profit for the half year
ended March 31 in the range of $4.5/5 million vs a net loss after tax of $500,000 for the prior
corresponding period.

Underlying profit measures before non recurring items are expected to be in the range of U/lying EBITDA
up 25/35% than the pcp of $16.4 million, U/lying NPAT up 45/55% higher than the pcp of $5.4 million.

Strong progress continues to be made on the delivery of Ruralco's strategic priorities including completion
of the acquisition of the Total Eden Group on February 28 which provides RHL with a leading national
position in water management. Managing director John Maher said in the report whereas the start up costs
of its new live export business have been greater than expected, most other activities shave performed
well in the half year.

*SLX: Discussions on Paducah continue to beconstructive/overall positive

Silex Systems Ltd CEO and managing director Dr Michael Goldsworthy in a letter to shareholders following
Silex's price fall said a number of factors have contributed - the global nuclear industry remains in a state

Page139of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.of recovery, the changes to ARENA announced in the Federal Budget create uncertainty in relation to
conditional funding contributions for the Mildura 100MW Solar Power Station project (the Federal
Government has confirmed its intention to abolish ARENA (the australian Renewable Energy Agency) but
has also confirmed the $1 billon of funding for"existing priority projects' will remain available. Silex
understands the $75 million conditonal funding for the Mildura 100MW project is one of the existing
priority projects and remains available - meanwhile the fate of ARENA depends on the passage of
legislation through the Parliament, in particular the Senate, which is still uncertain.

Also there has been some minor slippage in the expected timeline for finalisation of negotiations for the
Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility opportunity in the US, although they are proceeding constructively.
Silex said with cash reserves of approximately $67 million, zero bank debt and low overheads the
