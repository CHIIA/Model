The S&P/ASX 200 as at 2:27pm: down 40.5 to 5336.3

National Australia Bank is a "lighten" ..

A leading broker retained a "lighten" on National Australia Bank after its Clydesale Bank business
announced it will close 28 unsustainable branches as part of an overhaul of its 17 billion pound retail
portfolio.

The broker said in its view, enhancing branch profitability is a necessary pre cursor to a UK exit for NAB,
especially considering that core UK mortgage balances are geared towards the under performing "UK
North" region with 50% of exposure directed to this area, twice the sector average. The broker added the
UK goverment's announcement it will sell 1/5th of its stake in Lloyds is a positive when assessing broader
investor demand for UK banking assets, but considering NAB's core UK return on equity remains
subdued at about 5%, the path towards a successful UK exit remains some way off.

NAB down 12.5c to $34.92.5.
Please note: We have long held a minute stake in NAB.

Stockland downgraded to "underweight" ..

A leading broker downgraded Stockland to "underweight" with a price target of $3.80 from "overweight"
with a price target of $4 to reflect increasing strategic risk.
The broker said it sees SGP's 19.9% stake in ALZ as a clear negative, and question SGP's strategic
rationale for the move. The broker said it sees an outright play on ALZ as a real risk, with SGP needing to
raise around $2.2 billion to fund an outright takeover at ALZ's current share price.

It said its analysis shows only half of ALZ's residential pipeline as having strategic value for SGP.

SGP down 5c to $3.64.

Alumina is an "add" ..
A leading broker retained an "add" on Alumina with a target price of $1.75. The broker said increased
news flow on aluminium production cuts from China's largest aluminium producers are giving the

Page301of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.strongest sign yet that China's aluminium industry is acting more economically rationally than the market
expects.

The broker said in the report, "We forecast AWAC's EBITDA per tonne will expand to $US80 per tonne in
2015 from $US45 per tonne in 2013 driven largely by a weaker $A/$US exchange rate, slightly lower
costs and about 10% higher realised alumina prices. This should increase AWAC's earnings to more
than $US500 million in our view, allowing a substantial dividend to AWC and a dividend yield of 6/7%".
The broker added if the historic correlation between the Alumina share price and dividends received from
AWAC continue, the stock should re-rate sharply.

AWC down 2.5c to $1.13.5

PanAust is an "overweight" ..

A leading broker has an "overweight" on PanAust with a price target of $2.60.

The broker said recent comments from MinMetals confirmed it is in talks with Glencore-Xstrata for Las
Bambas. As part of the Glencore-Xstrata merger, the Chinese Ministry of Finance requires it to divest its
Las Bambas asset. Should this proceed, the broker said, it sees no impediment to PNA's acquisition of
Frieda River.

If not, Glencore-Xstrata must divest one of four other assets, not including Freida, nominated by the
Chinese Ministry of Finance.

That would create significant uncertainty around the next steps for PanAust acquiring the Freida River
asset. The broker said Freida River looks better on its latest long term copper price of $US3.60/lb,
valuing Freida at $US683 million with an unlevered IRR of 16%, above its estimate cost of capital for
PanAust but below a20% hurdle rate it views as appropriate.
"Copper price is the key factor" the broker said. At current levels, PNA valuation at $2.60 per share is
highly compelling.

PNA down 6c to $1.53.5.
