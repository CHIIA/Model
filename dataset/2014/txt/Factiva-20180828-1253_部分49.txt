Two global private equity giants are set to face off in a battle for Australia's TreasuryWine Estates Ltd.
after TPG Capital Management LP matched a $3.1b move from KKR & Co LP for one of the world's
biggest wine makers. Treasury said it was opening its books to both suitors for due diligence. The
skirmish for Treasury comes as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in Australia booms, driven by
takeovers by overseas players. Australian M&A deal volume jumped to $81.1b so far this year, making it
the biggest year for deal activity since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data. Treasury has regularly
dismissed suggestions it may consider a sale to large trade players like China's Bright Food Group Co.
Ltd., France's Pernod Ricard and US-based Constellation Brands Inc.
