CAPE PERTH, July 14 AAP - Cape Lambert Resources says it will receive a $51.6 million settlement
payment following a long running dispute about an $80 million sale of its magnetite iron ore project.

Cape Lambert expects the money to be paid within a week after the Arbitrator and Escrow agent
releases $30 million to the Metallurgical Corporation of China Limited (MCC) and $51.6 million to
Cape Lambert.

"The Company is very happy to see a resolution of this matter," Cape Lambert chief executive Tony
Sage said in a statement.

The payment will bring Cape Lambert's cash, receivables and listed securities to the value of $100
million.

Shares in Cape Lambert will emerge from a trading halt on Tuesday after last trading at 7.4 cents.
