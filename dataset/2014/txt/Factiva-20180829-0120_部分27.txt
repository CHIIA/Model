CapitaLand Ltd. has sold its entire stake in an Australian property developer for US$767 million as
the Singapore company focuses on China and its core domestic market.
The Singapore property developer, Southeast Asia's largest by market value, is completely exiting
from Australand Property Group. Australand, which has a market capitalization of 2.3 billion
Australian dollars (US$2.1 billion), develops and owns residential and commercial properties mostly
in Australia's largest cities -- Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Its tenants include Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd., Australia's largest bank by market value,
and Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's biggest airline,

"We have decided to divest our remaining stake in Australand now as market conditions are favorable
and Australand's share price has performed strongly in the past few months. This divestment would
allow us to reallocate capital to our core businesses in Singapore and China," Lim Ming Yan,
CapitaLand's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement on Wednesday.
CapitaLand, which is 39% owned by state investment firmTemasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., has been
looking to sell Australand for more than a year. Both CapitaLand and Australand sought potential
buyers for Australand in January 2013, but concluded the effort in July after failing to receive
proposals deemed to be "superior to business as usual."
Last November, the Singapore developer sold a 20% stake through a placement that fetched A$434
million, reducing the company's stake from 59.1%.

CapitaLand is selling the remaining 39.1% stake, or 226.2 million securities of Australand, at an
average price of A$3.75 each, a 3.6% discount to Australand's closing price of A$3.89 on Tuesday.
Shares of Australand have gained 15% in the past 12 months, outperforming the benchmark
S&P/ASX200 index, which has gained 7% over the same period.
In a separate filing, Stockland, another Australian property developer, said it has acquired 20% of
Australand for around A$435.3 million.

Mark Steinert, chief executive of Stockland, said that "over time, this holding will enable us to explore
strategic opportunities with Australand."
Stockland is a diversified property developer and manager, with assets including shopping malls,
residential-housing communities and retirement villages.

"Ultimately, we believe Stockland will look to undertake a full takeover of Australand, which suggests
a meaningful equity raising to fund the deal," analysts at Macquarie Group in Sydney said in a note to
clients.

CapitaLand intends to use the proceeds of the deal to explore opportunities in its two core markets
and repay some debt.

optimistic about its prospects in China and that it believed the outlook for long-term demand for
homes, shopping malls and offices in Singapore remains positive.
CapitaLand's China unit is shifting its focus to low-cost homes because it expects the country's
urbanization drive will boost demand for residential property. Earlier this year, the developer paid
US$181 million to buy a residential site in the coastal city of Ningbo, planning to build 1,100 small
and medium-size homes.
CapitaLand's real-estate portfolio primarily includes homes, offices, shopping malls and serviced
residences. The listed entities of the CapitaLandGroup include CapitaMalls Asia, Ascott Residence
Trust, CapitaCommercial Trust, CapitaMall Trust, CapitaMalls Malaysia Trust and CapitaRetail China
Trust.
