DEAREST HOUSE
This 1433-square-metre block in Glen Waverley sold before auction to a family relocating from China.
On a reconnaissance mission of sorts before moving here properly, they put in a strong offer on
Tuesday of $1.6 million, which was accepted. They beat three other groups including a local family, a
disability support group and a young couple looking to build units. The block, at 21 Campbell Street, has
a 10-bedroom house on it which will likely be knocked down to build two houses for the family. Had it
gone to auction the reserve would have been about $1.5 million-$1.55 million. (Ray White)

ALBERT PARK

56 DANKS STREET
$1.2 million-$1.3 million

321

With the beach just around the corner and Albert Park Village a short walk away, there's much to love
about this single-fronted Victorian. The renovated and extended home has two bedrooms running off the
hallway and a feature atrium bringing natural light into what would have otherwise been a dark area. The
master bedroom with en suite and a walk-in wardrobe is on the first floor. The property is tenanted until
next September and currently earns $820 a week. Agent Hockingstuart, 9690 5366 Auction 1.30pm,
Saturday

RICHMOND

36 ROWENA PARADE
$1 million+

312
It was a bakery, a confectionary store and Dublin Dairy before it was turned into a residence. The
facade is now protected by heritage overlay, which means the new owners will not only be buying a
home, but a piece of history. This 1850s home has two bedrooms on either side of the hallway and a
study that can be turned into a third bedroom. There is also a second street frontage and parking for two
cars, which is considered rare for Richmond.

This renovated Spanish Mission-style home in a coveted street of period homes is down the road from
Lumley Park and High Street's boutiques and cafes. Leuwin has ornate ceilings, parquet floors and open
fireplaces. Entry is into a hallway, with the living and formal dining to the left. A family and meals area
past the kitchen opens to a covered entertaining area and lawns. Extras include a study, home office
and plantation shutters.

Just a short walk to Gilbert Road trams, this villa unit is the first of five on the block. It's set back from the
wide, tree-lined street and enjoys northern light from both bedrooms. Recently updated, the home
features an up-to-the-minute kitchen and bathroom with a separate toilet, polished floorboards and a
private undercover alfresco courtyard ideal for entertaining. Fourteen groups, comprising mainly
downsizers and first-home buyers, viewed the unit last Saturday. Agent Love Real Estate,
