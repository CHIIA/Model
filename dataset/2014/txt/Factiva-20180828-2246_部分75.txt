US giant in $2bn bid for Recall
TAKEOVER activity is roaring to life ahead of the new year, with data management company Recall
Holdings being put in play after receiving a more than $2 billion bid from Boston-based logistics
giant Iron Mountain.

After being touted as a potential predator for years, Iron Mountain has pounced on Recall with a
roughly $7 a share offer, valuing the company at $2.2bn, sources said.

Recall, which stores and manages companies’ physical and digital data in 306 facilities around the
world, declined to comment on the approach, understood to have been made on Friday night.

But the offer, which may include a high level of scrip, is expected to be seen as too cheap by Recall’s
board, which is chaired by veteran company director and senior executive Ian Blackburne.
Analysts at UBS this month estimated Iron Mountain could pay $9 a share due to the stronger US
dollar and its rising share price on the New York Stock Exhange, which has been driven by its recent
conversion into a real estate investment trust to boost payouts.
The move on Recall continues the rush of corporate activity before Christmas, including China
Communications Construction Company’s $1.2bn purchase of Leighton’ contracting division John
Holland and APA Group’s $5bn buyout of BG Group’s Queensland coal-seam gas pipeline — the
second-biggest acquisition of the year.

It marks a strong end to the year for deal-making after the bumper start slowed down in the second
half amid an uptick in global concerns. It is also continues the deep history of demerged companies
attracting takeover attention.

Recall, which is listed in Australia but led by chief Doug Pertz based in the US, has seen its shares
soar 27 per cent since late September when Bloomberg reported Iron Mountain was considering a
move on its smaller rival.
Iron Mountain’s interest was also touted before Recall was eventually spun out of wooden pallet
company Brambles late last year.
“The synergies are enormous (circa $200 million-plus),” said one large investor in Recall.

“Recall shareholders would want the upside shared fairly between both camps. “Given the enormous
accretion this deal delivers Iron Mountain, Iron Mountain shareholders should be keen to pay up for
this unique game-changing asset.” UBS analyst Simon Mitchell estimated Iron Mountain could
extract up to $270m in cost synergies.

Foundation Investment Company, are understood to be keen for at least 25 per cent of the
synergies to go to them.
Under the terms that have been proposed, it is less than half that, sources said. Iron Mountain also
trades on a multiple of 13 times versus Recall at 9.9 times, so the deal would be instantly accretive
even without the synergies.
Iron Mountain’s move continues a surge in deals in the US records management industry, with
Access snapping up a range of businesses from Cintas and Recall this month buying Business
Records Management for $US77m.

Recall has made six acquisitions since July as it chases growth after years of being in limbo through
Brambles’ unsuccessful attempts to sell the business and then the demerger last year.The Americas
made up 42 per cent of Recall’s $836m in sales revenue in full-year 2014, ahead of Europe,
Australia and New Zealand and Asia.
