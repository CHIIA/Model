Mineral Resources chairman Peter Wade says the company still hopes to win work on development
of the West Pilbara project despite losing out in its surprise tilt for Aquila Resources.
Speaking at MinRes’ Carina mine site in the Yilgarn yesterday, at the launch of the company’s new
rail fleet for its southern operations, Mr Wade admitted Baosteel and Aurizon’s $1.4 billion cash
offer was “more compelling” than MinRes’ bid.

“We wanted to be involved, we hope still to be involved at some stage but the Baosteel bid was
more compelling at the time,” Mr Wade said. He said said MinRes’ last-minute scrip offer for Aquila
was a play for a seat at the table for major contracting work at the $7 billion West Pilbara project.
He rejected speculation MinRes could still seek an entry via an offer to buy AMCI’s 25 per cent
project holding. There is talk AMCI’s Hans Mendes is visiting Perth, potentially for Baosteel-Aurizon
talks.

Mr Wade said MinRes still believed it was a compelling option as a major contractor and was still
interested in the work.

West Pilbara ambitions aside, Mr Wade said yesterday MinRes was firmly focused on the Yilgarn
region. It had bought six US and Australian-built locomotives and 382 Chinese-made ore wagons to
transport ore from its Carina mine to the Kwinana bulk handling terminal.

Although Carina has a mine life of only two years, Mr Wade said MinRes was in the final stages of
winning approvals for two new mines to extend the life of its Carina hub by up to six years.

If it can convince the environmental watchdog to approve development of its Bungalbin East mine,
within the Helena-Aurora conservation park, its operational life could be extended to 15 to 20 years
in the region.

The Environmental Protection Authority is expected to make a ruling within weeks. Having only
closed its acquisition of the Yilgarn assets through the $130 million cash-and-scrip takeover of
Polaris Metals in 2010, MinRes has quickly built a 5 million tonne-a-year operation in the region.
Mr Wade said the purchase of the rail fleet would cut the company’s costs and lead to more
flexibility in delivering ore to Kwinana.

It is understood MinRes is also looking at its options at the port end and is considering moving to a
trans-shipping model at Kwinana, using barges to carry ore to bigger vessels sitting off the
Fremantle coast. The use of Capesize vessels could save MinRes as much as $10 a tonne on
shipping costs.

MinRes shares yesterday closed up 5¢ at $10.96.
