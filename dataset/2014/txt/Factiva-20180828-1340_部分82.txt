Continued from Page 19 raised a $US6bn Asia fund last year, was rebuffed in its attempt to buy
Australian winemaker Treasury Wine Estates for $US2.85bn, while homegrown private equity firm
PEP bid $US1.1bn for compliance services provider SAI Global.

Southeast Asia’s tycoons are also aggressively pursuing deals, a trend that started a few years ago.
Singapore’s Frasers Centrepoint, controlled by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, this
month agreed to pay $US2.5bn to buy Australand, an Australian residential developer and office
landlord.

Singapore’s Wilmar International and Hong Kong’s First Pacific, run by Indonesian tycoon Anthoni
Salim, jointly bid for Australian food producer Goodman Fielder this year.

“We are seeing an increase in family groups pursuing cross-border deals that would not have been
contemplated a few years ago, driven by a desire to diversify and expand out of their core home
markets,” said Deutsche Bank’s head of Asia M&A, Mayooran Elalingam.
It is unlikely these hunters — whether private equity, corporations or tycoons — are going to stop
scouting deals anytime soon.“Deal activity is extremely broad and diverse, across sectors, countries
and types of transactions,” Mr Elalingam said. “In the past, Asia M&A was primarily led by China and
natural resources, whereas currently it is a lot more diversified.”
