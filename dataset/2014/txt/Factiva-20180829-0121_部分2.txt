Mining giant Glencore Xstrata PLC is close to reaching an agreement on the multibillion-dollar sale of its
Las Bambas Peruvian copper project to a Chinese consortium and could announce the deal as early as
Tuesday, people familiar with the situation said Monday.
The management of both Glencore and China Minmetals Corp, the state-controlled Chinese copper
company leading the Chinese consortium, are set for a final meeting Tuesday in London with an aim
toward signing an agreement, the people said. If all goes well, the sale of the Las Bambas mine--which
would be one of the biggest Chinese mining acquisitions in recent years--could be announced after
that, they said. There is still a chance that talks won't result in the signing of a deal.

GlencoreXstrata agreed to sell Las Bambas to win approval from China's Ministry of Commerce, known
as Mofcom, for Glencore International PLC to acquire Xstrata PLC, a deal which created the world's
fourth-biggest mining company and the world's biggest commodities trader. If signed, the deal would be
the biggest acquisition by China of an overseas mining asset since 2008, when state-owned Aluminum
Corp. of China, or Chinalco, took a 12% stake in Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto PLC for
US$14 billion, according to Dealogic.

A signing of the deal would cap months of negotiations that at times were strained. As recently as last
month, talks between the Glencore and Minmetals' sides hit a snag over price, pushing talks beyond an
internal March 4 deadline to reach a deal. The price the Chinese consortium will pay has yet to be
determined and will be completed at the London meeting, one of the people said. The Chinese
consortium ended up the front-runner for the asset earlier this year, people familiar with the deal said. At
the time, they said Las Bambas would likely be sold for more than US$5 billion.
