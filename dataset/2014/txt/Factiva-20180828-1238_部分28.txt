0522 GMT [Dow Jones] TD Securities says its faster-than-consensus forecast for a 2014 return to trend
growth in Australian GDP requires non-mining sector investment and resource exports to strengthen as
mining investment "sinks out of sight." Annette Beacher, the Asia-Pacific Head of Research at TD
Securities says she expects business investment to lift by 1.0% on quarter versus a market consensus of
a fall of 0.9%. But Beacher expects investment intentions for 2014-15 to still show a fall of 9%. "The risks
are firmly skewed towards a downgrade," she adds. This is all Australian dollar negative, Beacher added.

0513 GMT [Dow Jones] U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered little new in her Friday
speech on labour market developments at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, offering arguments that
would please doves and hawks but nothing in the way of a clear deviation from her previous emphasis on
continued labour market slack and monetary policy being data dependent, says Deutsche Bank foreign
exchange strategist Oliver Harvey. "What next? Positioning and a continued negative flow picture may
pose obstacles to the dollar rally in the absence of a renewed acceleration in U.S. data. The August labor
market report on Sept. 5 will be closely watched," he says. USD/JPY is currently at 104.21.

0508 GMT [Dow Jones] China's local governments are expected to auction more sites in prime locations
and set lower bidding prices amid the current weak housing market, Nomura Research analysts say in a
note. They add that land prices are expected to drop 10-20% over the next six months. Land sale
premiums accounted for more than 35% of local government income in 2013, it says. SouFun data
shows that land sales in second and third tier cities have fallen around 16-18% so far this year. "While
land prices began to correct in June, they remain unattractive for developers so far," Nomura says.
"Developers' high contribution to local governments' revenue would incentivize local governments to use
all feasible measures to prevent the hard landing of the property market." (esther.fung@wsj.com, Twitter:

0504 GMT [Dow Jones] OPEC is likely to adjust its oil output to balance the market before its November
meeting, assuming that Libyan oil production remains stable or grows, Barclays analyst Michael Cohen
says in a report. He says the current supply of light crude is sufficient to meet global demand, and
producers like Libya are having trouble selling cargos. "Buyers are particularly wary of Libyan crude
because of the security risks associated with loading a tanker in close proximity to militant clashes," he
says, adding that Libya will attempt to undercut prices. Nymex crude is down 16 cents at $93.49/bbl,
Brent crude is down 16 cents at $102.13/bbl. (eric.yep@wsj.com)

0503 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares of Chugai Pharmaceutical (4519.TO) are down 8.7% at Y3,340 after a
Bloomberg report that Roche Holding AG decided against bidding for the 40% of Chugai it doesn't
already own, and instead with concentrate on its $8.3 billion acquisition of InterMune. Last week, a
Bloomberg report that Roche is in discussions to make Cugai a wholly-owned subsidiary had sent its
shares up 15%. "If the report is true it looks like Roche's bid may just be put off for now (as opposed to

essentially returned to the level it was at prior to the reported bid; it's logical that it will remain there until
more clarity in the buyout front is known." (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

0457 GMT [Dow Jones] The Aussie/Kiwi cross reached 1.1159 Monday--its highest mark since Dec. 2,
2013--as the Australian dollar outperforms its New Zealand counterpart amid bullish U.S. dollar
sentiment. Dow Jones technical analysis shows the AUD/NZD advance this morning stalled just below
the previous base of 1.1162 set on Sept. 23, 2013. A rise above this level would expose the AUD/NZD
cross to 1.1223--the Nov. 29, 2013 reaction high. Support is expected at 1.1054--base of "buy zone" of
the 20-day Bollinger Band (an area between the one- and two-standard deviation upper Bollinger bands),
and then at 1.0997 (middle 20-day Bollinger Band). Spot AUD/NZD is at 1.1149 versus 1.1050 late
Friday. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
0457 GMT [Dow Jones] Asia's trade surplus with China shrank 90% in the second quarter from a year
earlier, according to trade data on 12 countries from CEIC, after growing 4.4% in the first three months of
the year. The region's surplus with China was sapped by a $2.8 billion, or 18.6%, drop in South Korea's
surplus and a $1.4 billion, or 13.6% drop in Taiwan's. Japan, India, Macau, Thailand and Malaysia run
trade deficits with China. The calculation doesn't include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar,
Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka or Vietnam, which haven't yet reported bilateral import data up to June.

0450 GMT [Dow Jones] Asia's imports from China rose 7.1% in the second quarter from a year earlier,
according to trade data on 12 countries from CEIC, up from 6.9% in the first three months of 2014. The
region's China imports were increased by a $2.1 billion, or 5.1%, increase in imports to Japan and a
$1.9 billion, or 18.2%, increase in imports to Taiwan. The calculation doesn't include imports to
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka or Vietnam, which
haven't yet reported bilateral import data up to June. (wayne.arnold@wsj.com)

0450 GMT [Dow Jones] Thailand's 29th prime minister Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha says he expects to form
a new cabinet by October after receiving endorsement by the country's king Monday. The timeframe of
the setup of a new cabinet is longer than analysts' expectation of early September. In a speech following
the endorsement ceremony, Gen. Prayuth vows to tackle economic problems by focusing on attracting
more investment, upgrading the country's infrastructure, and implementing tax and energy reforms.

0449 GMT [Dow Jones] China's "moment of financial reckoning" has merely been postponed, not
averted, says Yu Yongding, a former advisor to the People's Bank of China. "The fundamental problems
that triggered alarm bells in the first place--including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid
growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios--remain unresolved." said Yu,
who also served as an advisor to the National Development and Reform of China, in an online article.
Due to interest rate liberalization, he said China may find it more difficult to use artificially low rates to
contain leverage ratios, what the government did last time to tackle debt problems. Yu, however, said it is
too early to bet on a debt crisis in China. He said Japan's public debt/GDP ratio has surpassed 200% yet
no crisis has erupted--nearly two decades after economists first started warning of a crisis.

0415 GMT [Dow Jones] As a potent reminder of life in Australia after its mining boom years, Moody's
Investors Service Monday downgraded Western Australia state, the epicenter of iron-ore investment of
the last decade, to Aa1 from Aaa, and retained a negative outlook. The ratings downgrade reflects the
state's ongoing budget deficit position, "and a growing risk that this trend may not be reversed soon,"
Moody's said in a statement. The state government's increasing reliance on royalty income was listed as
a concern. Expenditure pressures related to the rapid expansion of the state's economy and population,
and "a weak policy response to the deteriorating financial and debt position" also contributed to the
decision, Moody's said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0412 GMT [Dow Jones] Caltex Australia's (CTX.AU) 1H dividend of A$0.20 surprises investors, driving a
5.7% rise in the refiner's shares. Some analysts, including Goldman Sachs, expected a flat A$0.17
payout, and Caltex signals there's more to come, as the planned closure of its Kurnell refinery this year
sparks a capital management review. "We had reduced the payout ratio to ensure we had appropriate
cash flow during the critical time of closing the refinery and building the import terminal," CFO Simon
Hepworth says on a conference call, confirming Caltex has accumulated around A$1 billion of franking
credits. Investors are also embracing Caltex's decision to cut 350 jobs on top of the 400 announced in
2012, although that spells bad news for the wider Australian economy, already grappling with a slowing
mining boom that has pushed unemployment to a 12-year high of 6.4%. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
