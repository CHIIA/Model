ASX-listed iron ore explorer FeOre Ltd. has priced its planned share buyback at 7.55 Australian cents per
fully paid ordinary share, the company said June 10.
The company flagged in January its plans to undertake a capital distribution via a share buyback program
once it had received the second payment from the US$107.7 million sale of its stake in Topone Star
Investments Ltd. to private company China Energy (Cayman) Ltd.

The move received shareholder backing at a special general meeting in Hong Kong on April 25, following
receipt of the second payment of US$45.36 million on May 29.

FeOre said the repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares.
The company allocated the funds raised from the sale of the Topone Star interest to repaying bonds and
funding the development of its iron ore projects in Mongolia. FeOre recently suffered a delay in the
approval of its Dartsagt project due to an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the region, which
held up meetings related to the project's approval and also reduced access to both Dartsagt and the
nearby Ereeny project.
