A PRIVATE Chinese developer is poised to spend more than $40 million on an office building in
inner-city Sydney with plans to convert it into apartments.
The property at 9-25 Commonwealth Street in Surry Hills was sold by the NSW government to a
private developer for about $20m last year.

Listed Singaporean developer Roxy Pacific Holdings had been in due diligence to buy the
property earlier in the year. However, the deal fell over and the group instead opted to buy a CBD
site at 59 Goulburn Street from a Charter Hall-managed fund.
The nearly 800sq m property Hills consists of a four-storey office building that was previously the
headquarters of the AIDS Council of NSW.
The buyer has taken on the planning risk as it has not yet been approved for a residential
development.Knight Frank director of city sales John Bowie Wilson is brokering the deal but
declined to comment yesterday.
