2355 GMT [Dow Jones]--Investors should urgently review their holdings in Alchemia (ACL.AU) after the
biotech company missed the primary endpoint for it pivotal Phase III trial for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer, says Morgans analyst Scott Power. He says Alchemia's increased risk means the
company may now be unsuitable for many investors' portfolios. The disappointing outcome of the Phase
III trial prompted Morgans to cut its price target by 78% to A$0.19/share. ACL last traded at A$0.115.

2352 GMT [Dow Jones]--The task of delivering an improved margin appears to be getting tougher for
QBE Insurance (QBE.AU), argues Credit Suisse, which is penciling in some improvement on the back of
a lower expense ratio but cautions against expecting a significant rise from the current one of about 10%.
It maintains a neutral recommendation, A$12.20/share target. "Following a number of years of margin
improvement potential, QBE is now facing a global softening of premium rates." The brokerage lifts its
EPS forecast by 1.9% for FY15 but trims its by 2.9% for FY16. QBE is trading down 0.2% at A$11.30.

23:50 [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse lifts its price target on CSL (CSL.AU) to A$88.00 from A$78.50 after the
company agreed to buy Novartis's global influenza vaccine business. "Strategically, the acquisition
gives CSL scale in a business division that was lacking Northern Hemisphere presence," the broker
says. "It also provides CSL with differentiated products in a market that is competitive and now includes
quadrivalent vaccines, intradermally administered products and inhaled live attenuated vaccine." Keeps
Outperform rating. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2350 GMT [Dow Jones]--Nymex crude is likely to consolidate with risks skewed to the downside
near-term after hitting a more-than-two-year low of $79.44/bbl Monday, as long as it stays below
Monday's high of $81.29, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is still
negative-biased as the MACD and slow stochastic indicators are bearish, while the five and 15-day
moving averages are declining. A drop below the $79.44 support would expose the downside to $77.28
(June 28, 2012 swing low), then to $74.95 (Oct. 4, 2011 swing low). But a rise above the $81.29
resistance would temper the negative near-term view, targeting $81.95 (Friday's high), then the 10-day
exponential moving average (now at $82.14), $82.37 (Thursday's high), $83.15-$83.26 band
(Wednesday's high-Oct. 21 high), $83.48 (Oct. 20 high) and $84.45 (Oct. 17 high). December crude is
down 33 cents at $80.67/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2346 GMT [Dow Jones]--Vocus Communications (VOC.AU) isn't likely to be the only suitor for Amcom
Telecommunications (AMM.AU), says CIMB. On Monday, Vocus said it had bought a 10% stake in
Amcom and approached its board about an all-share deal to create a A$1 billion-plus company
providing services including high-speed broadband. CIMB notes TPG Telecom (TPG.AU) holds a
long-standing stake of around 4% stake in Amcom, and would be a good fit. "So too would iiNet,
NextGen and possibly Optus, although it is an unlikely bidder, in our view," the broker says. But CIMB
doesn't think M2 Group (MTU.AU) would be interested because its business model is too different to that
of Amcom. CIMB rates Amcom at add, with a A$2.37/share price target. AMM last traded at A$2.20.

2340 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australian terms of trade data for 3Q on Thursday are expected to reflect
further weakness in export prices led by iron ore and coal, the country's two biggest exports, says the
Commonwealth Bank. The recent fall in the Australian dollar will help offset some of the weakness in

Page200of266©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.commodity prices, but it won't be reflected until 4Q, it adds. The downtrend in commodity prices in 2014
is being keenly watched by the central bank as it represents a loss of income for the economy. The data
will also support the view of policy makers that the Australian dollar remains overvalued and needs to fall
to help support growth. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
2336 GMT [Dow Jones]--Southern-hemisphere thermal-coal prices are stable, but the outlook in China's
domestic market is looking more promising, says ANZ in a strategy note. Chinese power plants have
increased purchases on cooler weather in northern China and the risk is that domestic producers will
raise prices, it adds. Policies to curb China's domestic coal supply may lead to shortages ahead of year
end, with some expecting November prices to rise by as much as US$4.90/tonne it said.

2333 GMT [Dow Jones]--Macquarie remains underwhelmed by the recent A$0.70/share bid for Orbis
Gold (OBS.AU) by West Africa-focused gold producer Semafo (SMF.T). That's because the broker
values Orbis's Natougou gold project in Burkina Faso at A$503 million or A$0.77/share. "We believe
that to be successful a bid will need to be in the realms of the project's net present value," Macquarie
says. The broker says Natougou is clearly a quality ore body, although developing it could present some
challenges. "The deposit and the surrounding area would appear to be prospective for extensions and
satellite deposits," says Macquarie, which rates Orbis at outperform. "However, whether this translates to
a premium remains to be seen." OBS last traded at A$0.685. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2328 GMT [Dow Jones]--CSL (CSL.AU) has a strong track record for buying low and outperforming with
its acquisitions, but the planned US$275 million deal for Novartis's (NVS) flu business appears to have a
long-term growth profile, UBS says. The move promises to take CSL from being a sub-scale flu-vaccine
company to the No. 2 player in a US$4 billion global market. With the promise of longer-term growth,
UBS lifts its price target on CSL to A$87/share from A$84 and retains a buy recommendation. But it trims
its EPS estimates by 3.5% for FY16 and by 0.9% for FY17. CSL is trading up 1.3% at A$77.28.

2324 GMT [Dow Jones]--Deutsche Bank's Cameron McDonald says Aurizon Holdings (AZJ.AU) looks to
be ahead of target for hauling coal in Australia, but uncertainty around the impact of the upcoming wet
season and weakness in commodity markets is holding him back from changing his earnings forecasts
for now. Another key message from Aurizon's investor day is an apparent softening in its stance toward
the West Pilbara Iron Ore project, which Aurizon recently purchased in partnership with China's
Baosteel. Aurizon stated the project is an option not a commitment, saying any decision to invest won't
be based upon "trying to defy gravity." For McDonald, this indicates "that the required returns that
Aurizon will need out of the project may not be achievable in the current iron-ore price environment."
Deutsche rates Aurizon a buy, with a A$5.45/share price target. AZJ last traded at A$4.57.

23:25 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian consumer confidence rebounded 2.7% in the week ending 26
October to the highest level in twelve weeks, according to a survey by the ANZ Bank. The improvement
was likely supported by the rally in stockmarkets and reduced volatility generally in global financial
markets, it said. Households' view of economic conditions over the next year jumped almost 10% to the
highest level since mid-April, it added. "The lift in consumer confidence is encouraging but consumer
confidence clearly remains fragile and we will continue to monitor confidence closely for an early-read on
consumption into 4Q," said Warren Hogan, chief economist at ANZ. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

2320 GMT [Dow Jones]--The Australian dollar remains very quiet, ranging sideways, said Sean Callow,
currency strategist. It has traded between US$0.8795 and US$0.8811 so far in Asia. Resistance remains
around US$0.8850/60 but the calendar doesn't inspire optimism that ranges will be broken any time
soon, he adds. The currency is currently hovering at US$0.8799 with nothing scheduled in terms of data
or speeches. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
