Australia probes dumping claims against PV panel firms
Australia is investigating allegations that Chinese solar companies dumped panels in the local market.
The probe will examine imports of crystalline-silicon photovoltaic panels imported from July 1, 2012, to
December 31, 2013, Australia's Anti-Dumping Commission said in a statement on Wednesday on its
website. The US imposed tariffs as high as 3.5 times on Chinese solar products in 2012, and the
European Union followed a year later with protectionist measures.

EU levies 5-year tariffs on Chinese solar glass imports
The European Union imposed five-year tariffs on solar glass from China to help EU producers counter
alleged Chinese subsidies and price-undercutting, heightening trade tensions over renewable energy.
The five-year duties will take effect Thursday. The levies range from 0.4 percent to 36.1 percent,
depending on the Chinese exporter. The EU solar-glass market is valued at under 200 million euros
($274 million), the commission said when it opened the dumping inquiry in February 2013.

Interest-rate swaps rise on cash supply expectations
China's interest-rate swaps rose on speculation that the central bank will refrain from increasing the
supply of cash amid a push to adjust to lower economic growth. The People's Bank of China sold 97
billion yuan ($15.6 billion) of 28-day repurchase agreements on Tuesday after absorbing a net 60
billion yuan from the financial system last week. The one-year interest-rate swap climbed seven basis
points to 3.76 percent as of 5:10 pm in Shanghai, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Tencent's Q1 profits surge, beating analyst forecasts
Tencent Holdings Ltd., Asia's largest Internet company, posted first-quarter profits that beat analysts'
estimates on surging revenue from online games and advertising through its WeChat and QQ
messaging services. Net income soared 60 percent to 6.46 billion yuan ($1.04 billion) in the three
months that ended in March from 4 billion yuan a year earlier, helped by one-time gains, the
Shenzhen-based company said in a statement on Wednesday.
Coal, consumer staples lead Shanghai stock decline
China's stocks fell a second day as losses for consumer-staple producers and coal companies
overshadowed gains for property developers. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.1 percent to
2,047.91 at the close. A gauge of consumer-staples producers in the CSI 300 dropped 1.2 percent, the
most among 10 industry groups. Kweichow Moutai, the biggest producer of baijiu liquor, slumped 3.4
percent, its biggest loss since April 25. Yanzhou Coal slid 2.1 percent.
CITIC Pacific selling off $5.1 billion stake to investors
CITIC Pacific Ltd, which is acquiring $36 billion worth of assets from its State-owned parent, agreed to
sell $5.1 billion in shares to investors, including the country's social security fund. The National Social
Security Fund will buy HK$16.8 billion ($2.2 billion) of shares, while China Life Insurance Co will
invest $500 million, the steelmaker and property developer said in a Hong Kong exchange filing.
