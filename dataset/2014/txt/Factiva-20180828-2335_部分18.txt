A HIGH-profile property at Southport has been put on the market as activity continues to ramp up in
the Gold Coast’s officially designated CBD.
Property stalwarts John Potter and Phillip George, of Potter George Group, have put the for sale
sign up outside 83 Scarborough St, adjacent to the Australia Fair shopping centre.

CBRE’s Lachlan Harris and Mason Kidman are the marketing agents. On a 3805sq m site, the
holding comprises two fully-occupied detached buildings. Tenants include the ANZ and HSBC banks,
government offices and a travel group. It returns $1.02 million a year.
Mr Harris said the property had potential for major redevelopment upside. “The Southport Priority
Development Area Scheme essentially cuts red tape to streamline development decisions and this
site is set to benefit from it,” he said.Mr Kidman said with the opening of Southport’s Chinatown he
expected a large amount of interest from Chinese buyers.
