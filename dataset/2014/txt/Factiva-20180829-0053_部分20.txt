Australia's Atlas Iron made its first iron ore sale into India in May, and is looking to add other Asian
and European destinations, it said in a presentation Tuesday.
China has been Atlas' traditional export market, with the miner selling around 75% of its material on
term contracts and the balance through spot deals during the March quarter to small and medium
Chinese mills and trading houses, the company said previously.

Atlas told a Sydney conference iron ore prices have weakened significantly since the start of the year
due to rising supply. "Increasing supply is placing further downward pressure on 58% Fe products, with
significantly increased discounts to the 62% index being experienced for that product while the market
adjusts to accommodate the increased presence of this style of product," it said, according to a copy of
the presentation.
Atlas said higher-cost producers in China and other countries outside Australia and Brazil are facing
challenging economics at current prices, which it expects will tighten supply. But the Australian miner
said the recent A$1.4 billion ($1.3 billion) bid by China's Baosteel to acquire Aquila Resources
"vindicates the long-term need in China for 58% Fe product in expanding volumes, with Australia the
preferred source of supply."
Atlas said Tuesday it shipped more than 2 million mt of iron ore in April-May and set a record high for
shipments at 1.25 million mt in May.
The company's production guidance for this fiscal year remains at 10.2 million-10.7 million mt, with
cash costs in the range of A$49-52/mt, it said.
