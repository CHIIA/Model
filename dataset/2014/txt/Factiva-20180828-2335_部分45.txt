First Pacific Co. (0142.HK) said Thursday that the company and Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd.
(F34.SG) are progressing on obtaining other regulatory approvals for its planned takeover of food
producer Goodman Fielder Ltd. (GFF.AU), after Australia's competition commission said it won't
oppose the acquisition.

The Australian food maker in May accepted a sweetened takeover bid by the Hong Kong-listed
investment firm and Wilmar, the world's biggest palm-oil trader, in a deal that valued Goodman Fielder
at around 1.37 billion Australian dollars (US$1.21 billion).

First Pacific said Thursday it welcomed the decision by the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission.

The ACCC did note, however, that Wilmar and Goodman Fielder overlap in the supply of packaged
edible oils to Australian retailers, and in the supply of vegetable oils including canola, sunflower and
soybean oil.

Takeover interest in Australian food assets has surged in recent months, as bidders position
themselves for a rise in Asia's appetite for Western-style diets as the region's middle class grows more
affluent.

Goodman Fielder manufactures some of Australia's most recognizable food brands, including Meadow
Lea margarine, Praise mayonnaise and Wonder White bread.
