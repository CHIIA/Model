Packaging billionaireRaphael Geminder says he would be willing to consider mergers, roll-ups and
major acquisitions to help Pact Group, Australia's largest plastic packaging manufacturer, achieve its
$5 billion sales target within five years.

"We will do whatever is in the best interests of shareholders whether it's a roll-up, an acquisition, a
merger - as long as it's accretive - whatever combination works we'll be open minded," Mr Geminder
told investors on Wednesday after Pact released its maiden results after a $1.7 billion initial public
offering last December.

Pact, which makes plastic and steel containers for the food, beverage, personal care and chemical
industries, reported a net profit of $57.7 million in 2014, beating prospectus forecasts, after booking a
one-off tax benefit, cutting costs and reaping the benefit of recent acquisitions.
Sales for the year ended June rose 3.6 per cent to $1.14 billion, falling slightly short of prospectus
forecasts of $1.15 billion, due mainly to the loss of a milk bottle contract with Parmalat last year and
softer agricultural conditions in Australia.

However, statutory earnings before interest and tax and one-off items rose 4.8 per cent to $147
million, beating a prospectus forecast of $146.1 million, as the company cut costs, recovered higher
resin prices and completed the acquisition of bolt-on acquisitions.
Pact acquired Cinqplast Plastop and Viscount China from interests associated with Mr Geminder at
the time of the IPO. Underlying net profit rose 13.5 per cent to $59.7 million, compared with a
prospectus forecast of $52.6 million.
Pact booked one-off costs of $26.2 million, but also reported a $19.2 million one-off tax benefit, which
swelled bottom line profits to $57.7 million compared with a prospectus forecast of $25.5 million.
The initial public offer raised $650 million, valuing the company at $1.7 billion including debt, and
enabled Mr Geminder to cut his stake by almost half, to 40 per cent.

The shares traded above their $3.80 issue price for the first time earlier this week, but slipped 4¢ to
$3.82 after the result, which was in line with market forecasts.

Pact shares have been weighed down by investor concerns over related party transactions and
corporate governance issues.

Pact chief executive Brian Cridland and Mr Geminder put paid to these concerns, however, saying the
company had robust governance and related-party protocols in place.
The company declared a final dividend of 9.5¢, partly franked, payable on October 3.
