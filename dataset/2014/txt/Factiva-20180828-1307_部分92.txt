The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close marginally higher today.

evening.

"High will be 5561. Low will be 5530. Close at 5544, up 3.1 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract pointing up 4 points. US equities managed to close higher overnight,
although the volume on the move suggests it is just a bounce, rather than the initiation of a new rally.

"Widening credit spreads and the under performance of the banks and small cap stocks in the US, are
indicative of tightening liquidity, which by extension, implies further downside for equities in due course.

"But none of this matters for today. The high will be 5561. The low will be 5530. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5544, up 3.1 points'.

the s&p/asx200 closed down 15.5 points to 5540.9 points last evening.

August 5. Good morning.

Reporting today

*COH: Cochlear reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $105 mln/104.2 mln/$98.8 mln, div 127c/$97 mln.

*A leading broker with a "neutral" recommendation on July 28 said investors will be focused on the take
up of recent new product launches, i.e. the N6 processor (US and Europe), the Aqua+ accessory and the
re-launched N5 (Europe only) implant. The broker's price target is $62.

*Two brokers had "lighten" and "underweight" recommendations on July 20 and July 31 respectively.

One broker with a price target of $56.72, up from $55.76, said, "Despite impressive cost control, margin is
ultimately unsustainable considering the increasingly competitive environment".

The other broker with an "underweight" recommendation on July 31 had a price target of $44.68. the
broker said results point towards faster market C1 growth for 2014, with growth in bi-laterals likely to be
the driver of this gain. "For COH to meet guidance requires significant market share restoration.
Meanwhile, Advanced Bionics reported 50.2% revenue growth in six months to March 31 2014 on market
share gains'.

*DOW: Downer EDI reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $214.8 mln/$213.5 mln, div 11c/$220.9 mln.

*On July 25 a leading broker retained an "add" on Downer EDI, expecting it to beat on P&, operating cash
flow, net cash and likely full year 2015 guidance (where consensus is going backwards). Good result is
starting to be factored into the price, but the share price could run further as it is trading at a discount to
peers.

*MBE: Mobile Embrace Ltd reports for the year.

*TCL: Transurban Ltd reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $400,000, div 18c/$140.8 mln/$214.8 mln/prop EBITDA $A928mn, prop fcf
$A488 mln. The group has guided to 39c full year 2015 distribution.

*One leading broker with an "add" recommendation and a price target of $7.97, up from $7.29 said "TCL
remains our top pick in the transport infrastructure space given its unparalleled suite of assets and strong
growth prospects. Trading at 18.8x full year 2015 EV/EBITDA with a 5.1% yield and 9% DPS growth p.a.
over the next three years we maintain our Add rating on an increased $7.97 target price".

*Another leading broker with a "buy" recommendation and a $8.40 target price said it expects a first year
proportionate EBITDA contribution from NorthConnex of around $42 million in 2020 which grows to $58
million in full year 2125 and at around 6% p.a. thereafter.

The broker reduced its traffic growth assumptions on the Westlink M7 from 2018 onwards reflecting a
slowdown in demand from heavy traffic due to the impact of the truck toll multiplier.

Page393of417©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The broker (which has a Nil net earnings report for 2014) said it continues to view the stock's 10% p.a.
average 5 year distribution growth and near term catalysts as attractive. It retained a "buy"
recommendation and $8.40 price target.

*A leading broker on August 1 had a "neutral" recommendation for Transurban Group with a price target
of $7.52.

*In the Eurozone Eurostat reported the PPI eased a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in June, compared to
expectations for a flat reading. Producer prices inched down 0.1% in May. Year-over-year, the PPI

Page395of417©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.declined at an annualized rate of 0.8% in June, below forecasts for a drop of 1%. Prices fell at a rate of
1% in May.

*In the UK Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said that their U.K. construction
purchasing managers' index declined to a seasonally adjusted 62.4 last month from a reading of 62.6 in
June. Economists had expected the index to fall to 62.0 in July. Housing activity remained by far the best
performing construction category, with the latest rise in output the sharpest for over a decade.

Meanwhile, sharp increases in overall construction activity led to a new survey-record pace of job creation
and a further rapid lengthening of suppliers’ delivery times in July.

Commenting on the report, Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author the report, said, “Overall the
survey adds to the view that construction companies have performed impressively so far this summer,
which raises the likelihood that the sands of time could wash away the construction weakness seen in the
preliminary second quarter GDP release.”
