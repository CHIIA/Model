A wishy washy start to the new financial year as the positive vibe after the late rout yesterday evaporated
with Financials under the 'Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer'. In the final countdown, the market fell 20
pts to close at 5376 after a high of 5415 and a low of 5375. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (A$79.97,
-1.1%) continue to suffer as bad press and ASIC investigations swirl around but others getting sucked into
the vortex were in fact doing worse, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (A$32.84, -1.5%)
and Westpac Banking Corporation (A$33.38, -1.5%) well out of favour. Insurers chimed in too and health
care provider NIB Holdings Limited (A$3.10, -4.9%) had a shocker.

Resources though were on the tear with BHP Billiton Limited (A$36.00, +0.3%),Newcrest Mining Limited
(A$10.84, +3.0%) and RIO Tinto Limited (A$60.45, +1.9%) in demand as well as the much oversold gold
stocks like Silver Lake Resources Limited (A$0.55, +7.8%),St Barbara Limited (A$0.12, +4.3%),Kingsgate
Consolidated Limited (A$0.905, +5.2%),Regis Resources Limited (A$1.70, +3.7%) and #PRU. Other
miners joined in the fun Iluka Resources Limited (A$8.30, +2.1%),Oz Minerals Limited (A$4.19,
+2.4%),Western Areas Limited (A$4.77, +3.2%) and Sirius Resources NL (A$3.31, +2.2%).

In the industrial space Wesfarmers Limited (A$41.52, -0.8%) and Woolworths Limited (A$35.08, -0.4%)
were under fire from the regulator for bullying but discretionary spenders like Gambling were firmer Crown
Resorts Limited (A$15.20, +0.5%),Tatts Group Limited (A$3.37, +3.1%),Ainsworth Game Technology
Limited (A$3.77, +0.8%) spinning the wheel and winning. Tech stocks were also better led by Iproperty
Group Limited (A$3.22, +5.2%),Carsales.Com Limited (A$10.91, +3.0%),#ADJ# and #FLN#. Healthcare
stocks were mixed as ResMed Inc. (A$5.30, -3.3%) fell away but Csl Limited (A$67.13, +0.9%) rallied as
did Ramsay Health Care Limited (A$45.85, +0.8%) as we expect to see some investors making way for
the Healthscope IPO in the months to come.

Slotting in during extra time were TFS Corporation Limited (A$1.76, +6.7%),Liquefied Natural Gas Limited
(A$2.26, +5.6%),Energy World Corporation Ltd (A$0.34, +6.3%),Iproperty Group Limited (A$3.22,
+5.2%),Energy World Corporation Ltd (A$0.34, +6.3%),Adelaide Brighton Limited (A$3.56, +3.2%) and
Domino's Pizza Enterprises Limited (A$22.00, +2.5%) in large caps while in smalls Audio Pixels Holdings
Limited (A$4.75, +18.8%),Coventry Group Limited (A$3.15, +12.5%),Perseus Mining Limited (A$0.48,
+15.7%) and #TNG# shone. Bringing down a striker in the box were #NEC#,NIB Holdings Limited
(A$3.10, -4.9%),#NPX# and Ansell Limited (A$19.19, -3.2%) with Brockman Mining Limited (A$0.055,
unch) and Silex Systems Limited (A$1.07, -7.8%) suffering in the small caps.

Volume was big at nearly $4.2bn with the banks starring in the volume stakes taking out 4 of the top 5
spots. Aussie dollar firmed to 94.50 and digital tulips continue to draw in suckers to $683 and gold $1327.
Asian markets were mixed as Japan put on 1% and China and HK down around 0.13%.

Stocks and Stories

Rates remain on hold. So widely anticipated that no one even noticed I think. Talking heads will pour over
the statement but rates will be on hold for a long time to come.Dollar to continue to feel lovingly supported
by International investors and Japanese housewives.

taking the corporate restructure and writing off $124m.
