29 Aug 2014 01:10 ET Press Release: Fitch Affirms Fortescue at 'BB+'/Stable

The following is a press release from
Fitch Ratings:

TD

Fitch Ratings-Singapore/Sydney-29 August 2014: Fitch Ratings, Singapore/Sydney, 29 August 2014:
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Australia-based Fortescue Metals Group Limited's (Fortescue) Long-Term
Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and its senior unsecured rating at 'BB+'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable.
The agency has also affirmed the company's senior unsecured and senior secured debt, issued through
FMG Resources (August 2006) Pty Ltd, at 'BB+' and 'BBB-', respectively.
Fortescue's operating and financial profiles closely mirror that of an investment-grade rated company. In
particular, Fortescue is the fourth-largest iron ore producer in the world, and it has a low-cost base, which
results in strong profit margins. The completion of the company's expansion project in March 2014
increased the company's processing capacity to 155 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and helped
strengthen its cost position further.
Fitch also expects the company to reduce its FFO adjusted gross leverage (leverage) to below 2x. Fitch's
expectations are based on Fortescue repaying a further USD2.5bn of debt over the next 18-24 months to
achieve its publicly stated 40% gearing (measured by debt/(debt and equity)) and 62% Fe (cost and
freight) price - a benchmark price for iron ore - remaining at or above USD90 per dry metric tonne (dmt).

Fortescue would need to demonstrate a long-term commitment to maintaining a capital structure that is in
line with a 'BBB' category rating and a reduced risk appetite before Fitch would consider positive rating
action.

KEY RATING DRIVERS
- Higher Output, Lower Costs: Fortescue successfully produced ore at an annualised rate of 155mtpa in
the fourth quarter of the financial year ended 30 June 2014 (FY14), including a higher 160mtpa rate in the
month of June 2014. This compared with 124.2 million tonnes that were shipped in FY14. The
company's C1 costs (cash costs) reduced 23% to USD34/wet metric tonne (wmt) from a year earlier,
driven by lower stripping costs at Solomon, an improved product strategy, a 54% increase in output that
improved economies of scale, as well as a lower Australian dollar-US dollar exchange rate.

Strong Profits Drive Deleveraging: Fortescue's EBITDA (as defined by Fitch) rose 68% in FY14 to
USD5.6bn, with EBITDA margin increasing to 48% from 41%. The agency expects Fortescue's EBITDA
margin to remain at around 42%-46% over the medium term, provided the 62% Fe price doesn't fall below
USD90/dmt on a sustained basis (for more information, see "Updating Fitch's Mid-Cycle Commodity Price
Assumptions", dated 28 July 2014, on www.fitchratings.com). The company repaid USD3.1bn of debt in
FY14 and has committed to repay a further USD500m in October 2014. Leverage is likely to reach around
2.1x in FY15 after this repayment and amid Fitch's expectation that iron ore prices would weaken from
the previous year's levels. This compares with 1.8x in FY14 when iron ore prices improved and 4.0x in

Page199of405©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.FY13. Leverage could fall further to around 1.8x by FYE15 if the company calls an additional USD2bn of
its outstanding notes.

Strong Liquidity, Flexible Structure: Fortescue had cash reserves of USD2.4bn at end-June 2014, while its
earliest mandatory debt repayment of USD1bn falls due only in 2017. Furthermore, Fitch expects
Fortescue to generate strong post-dividend free cash flow, as the company's capex will fall to
maintenance levels over the medium term. Fortescue has considerable flexibility around its debt structure
and repayments because its secured credit facility, which accounts for over 50% of FY14 debt, is
repayable at the company's discretion. Furthermore, each tranche of its senior unsecured notes, which
account for the remainder of its debt, can be called early.

-

- Lack of Diversification: Fortescue has limited business diversification compared with its higher rated
international peers. It has only one product, iron ore, which it sells predominantly in the Chinese market.

Secured Credit Facility: The rating on the secured credit facility is notched up one level from Fortescue's
'BB+' IDR to reflect the additional provision of quality collateral, including mining tenements. This uplift for
a 'BB+' rated company is consistent with Fitch's "Recovery Ratings and Notching Criteria for
Non-Financial Corporate Issuers" criteria.

RATING SENSITIVITIES
- Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions include:

- - A demonstrated commitment to maintain a capital structure that is more in line with a 'BBB' category
rating and,

- - sustaining FFO adjusted gross leverage at less than 2x and FFO fixed-charge cover at more than 5x
(FYE14: 6.1x)
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include:

- - FFO adjusted gross leverage exceeding 3x and FFO fixed charge cover remaining below 4x
