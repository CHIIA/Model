[Dow Jones] The number of new Australian business startups jumped 23% in the second quarter of 2014
from the first quarter in a sign that confidence about trading conditions may be strengthening, said Dun
and Bradstreet. On the back of record low borrowing costs and expectations of stronger growth, Dun &
Bradstreet's review found that 62,160 enterprises commenced operations during the second quarter of
this year, up from 50,539 in the three months previous and 57,504 in 2013. Business failures declined
11% from the previous quarter. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

2352 GMT [Dow Jones]--AGL Energy (AGK.AU) faces more community and environmentalist opposition
to proposed coal-seam-gas drilling in Australia's New South Wales state, potentially delaying a key
project and weakening profits, says Credit Suisse. AGL wants to make a final investment decision on its
Gloucester development in the second half of 2015, but Credit Suisse has only attributed A$88 million in
value to the project out of a A$347.5 million book value, due to delay risks. AGL's retail arm could also
be exposed to campaigns by activists that trigger customer losses, the broker says, keeping a "neutral"
recommendation and A$15.60 price target on the stock vs. its latest trade of A$14.67.

2349 GMT [Dow Jones] Navitas (NVT.AU) needs to deliver on its U.S. growth strategy, says UBS, after
the education provider's earnings from Australia were hit by the loss of a key contract with Macquarie
University. UBS notes the market has been attracted by the company's growth prospects. "To date,
Navitas' foray into the U.S. has underwhelmed and perfect execution is now required. In the short term,
we believe the second wave of growth has passed and the U.S. is needed to create a third." The broker
has cut its price target on the stock to A$4.95 from A$5.20 after the company reported a 31% annual net
profit fall yesterday. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)
[Dow Jones] Uranium prices will likely be in the doldrums for longer, as Japan continues to delay
restarting reactors that would eat into the current glut in supply of the nuclear fuel, says J.P. Morgan
analyst Mark Busuttil. "Pricing stability is now in the hands of the producers and their willingness to curtail
supply," he says. J.P. Morgan cuts its uranium spot price forecasts by 22% to US$31/lb in 2014, by 40%
to US$30/lb in 2015, and by 33% to US$40/lb in 2016. Still, Busuttil thinks the longer-term prospects are
bright as no new uranium projects are in development, and prices should eventually recover to
US$75/lb. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

xxxx GMT [Dow Jones]--Nymex crude is likely to consolidate with a bearish bias near term, after hitting
an eight-session low of $100.90/bbl Monday before settling down 42 cents at $101.67/bbl, Dow Jones
technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is negative-biased as the MACD and slow
stochastic indicators are bearish, while the five-day moving average is falling below the declining 15-day
moving average. A drop below $100.90 support would expose the downside to the 200-day moving
average (now at $99.89), then to $99.01 (July 15 reaction low), $98.91 (May 5 low), $98.74 (May 1 swing
low), and $98.25 (March 21 reaction low). But a rise above $102.10 (Monday's high) would temper the
negative near-term view, targeting $102.53 (Friday's high), then $103.34 (Wednesday's high), $$103.45
(July 22 high), $104.99 (July 21 reaction high) and $105.53 (July 2 high). September crude is down 19
cents at $101.48/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2337 GMT [Dow Jones]--The Nikkei is likely to rise as caution over April-June earnings eases, says
Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equity at SMBC Nikko Securities. Previously, investors were worried
Japan's sales tax hike in April could weigh on results. "Excessive concerns are receding," he says,

Page156of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.adding the Nikkei may trade in a 15500-15650 range. The index ended up 0.5% at 15529.40 on Monday.
Nikkei 225 September futures ended Chicago trading at 15565 Monday, compared with an earlier close
in Osaka at 15510. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com)

2333 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/JPY has been changing hands in extremely tight 101.07-102.27 range
(Y1.20) so far in July, reinforcing the possibility the pair moves in the narrowest-ever range on a monthly
basis since mid-1970s, says Daisaku Ueno, chief FX strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. "It is
hard to find any appropriate adjectives to describe the stalemate that remains pervasive in USD/JPY
trade," he says. Record-tight range on a monthly basis (Y1.34) was registered in December 2011. In
July, the USD/JPY hit as low as 101.07 on July 10, when the JPY was bought on risk aversion stemming
from recent troubles at a Portuguese bank; The pair hit 102.27 on July 3 after solid U.S. June jobs data.
One-month implied volatility hit record low 4.305% on July 17. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

2331 GMT [Dow Jones]--UBS cuts Leighton (LEI.AU) to Sell from Neutral on valuation, as the stock is
trading on a 23% premium to the broker's A$18 valuation and price target, which is unchanged despite
an underlying first-half profit of A$319 million versus A$298 million expected. "We believe that
Leighton's cashflow weakness and generally high level of receivables continues to remain a key issue,"
the broker says. "With management commenting that the elevated level of receivables are 'likely to
remain until the current domestic LNG projects are completed and final agreements negotiated', we do
not see a quick turnaround in this situation and believe it will continue to be a source of potential risk to
earnings and asset values." LEI last A$22.10. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2330 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian consumer confidence continues to stage a strong recovery, rising
2.4% in the week ending July 27 from a week earlier, completely erasing a sharp plunge seen after the
government announced its budget in mid-May. ANZ's Chief Economist, Warren Hogan, said the "sticker
shock" from the budget has proved temporary with improving house prices and job market likely lifting the
mood of consumers. Consumer confidence has now moved into line with business confidence, which
was far less affected by the budget. "ANZ's base case remains that consumer-spending growth will
remain moderate this year, before improving next year as the non-mining recovery gathers momentum,"
Mr. Hogan said. (james.glynn@wsj.com)

2326 GMT [Dow Jones]--Credit Suisse lifts its price target on Challenger (CGF.AU) to A$9.35 from
A$7.50, saying CGF stands to benefit from any regulatory changes favoring annuities. "While CGF's
valuation gap to financial peers has closed, we see it as inexpensive given the growth options." Keeps
Outperform rating. Notes recent reports by Treasury and the Financial System Inquiry have highlighted
weaknesses in Australia's retirement income system; both viewed annuities as a possible solution. "We
expect the market to grow considerably over the medium term. As the leading annuities provider in
Australia, CGF is well positioned to capitalise on this opportunity with a strong brand and distribution
capability," the broker says. CGF shares last traded at A$8.18.(rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com;

2312 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan keeps its Underweight rating on National Australia Bank Ltd.
(NAB.AU), saying that a runoff of U.K. noncore commercial real-estate loans will not be material. "Our
recent research highlights that NAB's U.K. CRE portfolio explains a mere 7 basis points of an 80 basis
points deficit in risk-adjusted margins relative to peers," the broker says. "Further, to the extent that any
capital released from the sell-down becomes available at the Group level as opposed to being retained to
support residual assets, NAB is still facing a A$1.97 billion ($1.85 billion) Core Tier 1 headwind from the
removal of gearing in the Wealth subsidiaries." Target price rises to A$35.51 ($33.36) from A$35.35.
NAB last A$34.69. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)
2307 GMT [Dow Jones] Private-equity firms are chomping down on dental-services deals. Toronto firm
Imperial Capital Group and OPTrust Private Markets Group, an arm of Canadian pension fund OPSEU
Pension Trust, invested C$121 million in Toronto's Dental Corp. of Canada Holdings Inc., which
provides administrative services for dentists. "We've looked at the dental industry ever since we started
health care," said Imperial Partner Justin MacCormack, noting the sector's fragmentation, demand for its
services and opportunities for organic growth among reasons for the firm's investment in Dental Corp.
"Being in our backyard, that's a plus as well," he said. Other P-E firms are investing in the space. China's
Citic Capital Partners earlier this month bought dental laboratory DDS Lab, and Huron Capital Partners
launched dental support organization Spring & Sprout Dental Holdings LLC in June.
