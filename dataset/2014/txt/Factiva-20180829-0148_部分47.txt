Moody's Investors Service says that Yancoal Australia Ltd's (unrated) positive operational performance is
credit positive, but has no immediate impact on Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. Ltd's Ba1 corporate family and
senior unsecured debt ratings and their stable outlook.
On 16 January 2014, Yancoal Australia, a 78% owned subsidiary of Yanzhou Coal, announced that its
total annual coal production volume reached 16.9 million tons in 2013, up 15% year-on-year from 14.6
tons in 2012. At the same time, its total coal sales volume grew 14% year-on-year to 17 million tons.

"Yancoal Australia's improved coal production and sales volumes for 2013 indicate that it is effectively
managing its operational challenges and that it is in a better position than in 1H 2013 to turn around its
losses, which is credit positive and in line with Moody's expectations" says Alan Gao, a Moody's Vice
President and Senior Analyst.

Moody's expects Yancoal Australia's improvement can be sustained and will result in positive profit
contribution in 2014.
"Moreover, Yancoal Australia's improved cost saving is credit positive" says Gao, who is also the lead
analyst for Yanzhou Coal.

Yancoal Australia disclosed that it had achieved its 15% unit production cost savings target in 2013.
Moody's estimates that Yancoal Australia's average unit gross profit in 4Q 2013 will be similar to that in
3Q 2013 at around RMB140-150 per tonne, which has improved from RMB132 per tonne in 1H 2013.
Moody's estimates that Yancoal Australia will represent 28% of Yanzhou Coal`s total coal production in
2013. The improved volume and cost savings will have some, but not a significant positive impact on
Yanzhou Coal's financial position.

Moody's has factored in the improvements in the Ba1 rating, and expects its debt/EBITDA to trend down
to around 4.5X in 2014 from 5x-5.5x for 2013, and its (cash flow from operations -- dividends)/debt to
reach 10%-15% over the next 12 to 18 months.
The principal methodology used in this rating was the Global Mining Industry published in May 2009.
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited was listed in Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York in 1998. It is
53% owned by the Yankuang Group, a state-owned enterprise wholly owned by the Shandong Provincial
State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and is one of the top coal mining
groups in China.
