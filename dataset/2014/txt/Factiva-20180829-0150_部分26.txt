Deutsche Bank today announced its appointment as the depositary bank for the non-capital raising

LNG Ltd (OTC US: LNGLY) is an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. LNG

liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and the company's vision is to bring a dynamic concept of mid-scale
LNG plants to the international energy market. LNG Ltd's projects include the development of its 100%

Louisiana, and 100% owned 3 mtpa Gladstone LNG Project in the Port of Gladstone, Queensland,
