Australian shares posted their strongest session in five months in a relief rally that clawed back some
of the heavy losses of the previous two sessions.
Stocks found support after the oil price rose and the Reserve Bank of Australia held the official cash
rate at its record low 2.5 per cent for the 15th consecutive month.

In other local economic news, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed the current account deficit
narrowed to $12.5 billion in the September quarter, beating expectations for a $13.5 billion shortfall.
A separate ABS report showed the building sector doing better than forecast.

On Tuesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 1.4 per cent to 5280.2 points, while the
broader All Ordinaries Index added 1.3 per cent to 5260 points.
Local shares lifted after oil and gold prices bounced on Monday night and despite taking a negative
lead from equity markets in the United States and Europe.
Australia's energy and mining sectors led Tuesday's sharemarket rally as producers got some relief
after selling down heavily over the previous three sessions.
Oil, gas and related stocks had slumped after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) made a surprise decision last week to maintain production levels despite a global supply
surplus of around 1 per cent to 2 per cent. Investec Asset Management's Global Energy portfolio
managers Tom Nelson and Charles Whall are tipping the global sell-off in energy producers will
recover quickly in anticipation of a rise in oil prices.

"The recovery is likely to surprise investors in its speed and scale, just as the sell-off has. We
fundamentally believe that we are approaching the bottom in terms of sentiment, investor positioning
and valuation," they said.
Brent crude oil bounced 2.8 per cent to $US72.11 a barrel before the local market opened on
Tuesday, after losing more than 13 per cent in a five-day slide.
Crude oil prices are down about 35 per cent year-to-date and trading around a four-and-half year low.
Australia's biggest oil producer Woodside Petroleum rallied 1.9 per cent to $34.86 after shedding
14.2 per cent over the previous three sessions.
After losing 17.1 per cent in three days Oil Search bounced 5.6 per cent to $7.70. Origin Energy
recovered just 0.5 per cent to $11.76, having shed 15.7 per cent in a five-day slide.

Santos, which lost more than 25 per cent of its market cap in the three days previous, bounced
0.9 per cent to $9.19.

cent to $57.93 as the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, slipped to $US71.11 a tonne.
UBS estimates that with the commodity price below $US73 a tonne, Australia's third-largest iron ore
miner Fortescue Metals Group is not profitable. On Tuesday Fortescue dropped another 1.9 per cent
to $2.57, as speculation builds the miner will cut more jobs.

"Despite the significant declines to date . . . it is difficult to identify any factors that are supportive of
iron ore prices in the near term.

"We retain our negative view of commodities and resource equities," Deltec International chief
investment officer Atul Lele said.

The big four banks were stronger as the RBA kept the cash rate on hold and ABS data showed a
bigger-than- expected 11.4 per cent jump in building approvals during October.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia lifted 1.2 per cent to $80.74, while Westpac Banking Corporation
rose 1.5 per cent to $32.73.

ANZ Banking Group added 0.2 per cent to $31.72, and National Australia Bank gained 0.8 per cent to
$32.39.
