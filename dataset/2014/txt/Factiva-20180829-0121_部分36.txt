Fear of tainted milk has turned Chinese families to the Australian product
EACH month, Beijing mother Christine Yang spends hundreds of dollars on baby milk powder that
she has her brother send her from Australia to feed her toddler daughter Tuanxi.

On Chinese supermarket shelves, Australian infant formula is more than twice the price of locally
manufactured products, but is hugely popular among parents.

``Australian products are more expensive, but the quality is guaranteed,'' Ms Yang told The
Weekend Australian.

``It concerns the health of my baby and for us safety is more important than money.''
Ms Yang is one of hundreds of thousands of parents in China still fearful in the wake of the
melamine-tainted milk scandal almost six years ago, in which six babies died and 300,000 were
hospitalised across the nation.
The crisis prompted parents to shun locally produced dairy products and sent demand for
international goods soaring.
Australia and New Zealand became the major beneficiaries of the shift, with dairy exports to
China rising dramatically.
It is estimated Australian exports have risen from $337 million a year in 2008, when the milk
scandal erupted, to $523m.
New Zealand sales increased from $520m a year to $4.57 billion, helped by the signing of a
free-trade agreement with China.
Demand for overseas milk products has become so strong that Hong Kong authorities restrict
Chinese mothers to taking just 1.8kg back to the mainland.

In supermarkets, foreign products are kept locked in glass cabinets to prevent shoplifting.
Ms Yang would buy Chinese products if authorities could guarantee their quality.
The strict one-child policy in China, which is starting to be relaxed in some parts of the country,
has made Chinese parents notoriously careful about their children.

``I have just the one child and do not want to take the risk,'' Ms Yang said.

``I want to emphasise that if the domestic formula brands could ensure their quality to us I would
like to consume those brands.''

monthly postal deliveries from her brother.

``My friends are all feeding their children with foreign formula,'' she said.
``When I knew I was pregnant I started to ask my friends to buy formula when they were overseas
and I started to stockpile it because it takes a month to arrive in China. I am lucky to have my
brother living in Australia.''

Shanghai mother Sun Jiejie said her young son preferred Australian-made infant formula over
Chinese products.
``I have fed my baby many different formulas from China and abroad,'' she said.
``And I found that when I fed him an Australian brand he was much more accepting of it. He is not
irritated or throwing up, which happened with some other brands.

``You have to see how your baby reacts to the formulas. They can tell you if it is good.''
