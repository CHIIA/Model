(Adds CNPC-Novatek deal)
BEIJING, May 21 (Reuters) - China's top energy group China National Petroleum Company (CNPC)
agreed with Russia's Novatek on Tuesday a binding contract to buy 3 million tonnes of liquefied natural
gas a year from Yamal gas project, according to the companies.

The companies did not state the duration or the start date of supplies. Novatek earlier targetted to start
supplying gas from the Arctic gas plant in 2017.
The multi-billion-dollar deal follows a framework deal last June under which CNPC agreed to to
purchase a 20 precent stake in the $27 billion Yamal LNG project, with Novatek holding 60 percent
stake and France's Total owning 20 percent.

CNPC is the parent of PetroChina .
China, the world's top energy user keen to curb use of dirtier coal, aims to raise total gas supplies to
400-420 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2020, and nearly a third of that are likely to be imported.
Chinese companies are operating eight LNG receiving terminals and one floating facility by now on its
east coast and have proposed more to be built in the coming years. And the country's economic
planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, normally grants final approval after LNG
resources are secured.
The following are the LNG imports deals that China has signed in recent years.
