Daniel Goulding, the author of The Sextant Report said, "Our market looks set to open higher with our
local futures contract up 30 points.

"Global equities were given some breathing room overnight with a moderate pull back in the Japanese
yen.

"Over in the US the Semiconductor index hit a new rally high and with the Trannies on the verge of doing
the same, there is a green light for US equities to hit new rally highs.

"Volume yesterday in our market, while higher than what we have witnessed recently, was not that
significant, suggesting it is just a pullback on the way to a new, perhaps final, rally high.

"The high today will be 5257. The low will be 5220. When the dust has settled the market will have closed
at 5242, up 30 points".

Byron Wein bullish for year, but may be a 10% correction early

Byron Wein, a market guru who was Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley for over 20 yeras and is now with
Blackstone Advisory Partners told CNBC last night he is bullish for 2014 but expects a serious breather,
up to 10%, early in the year.

He said everyone is currently on the same side of the boat. Almost everybody's made good money last
year and people are generally feeling pretty positive.

"When investor sentiment is as positive as this, it is usually vulnerable to any kind of a disappointment" he
said.
He added," I don't know that I'd be short the market because I'm so bullish for the overall year".

*DML: Restructuring of Boseto copper will mean 85 redundancies

Discovery Metals Ltd announced it is undertaking a restructuring program at its 100% owned Boseto
Operation to improve cost competitiveness and further enhance production efficiencies.

The restructuring follows extensive detailed discussions with key stakeholders, including employees, the
relevant Botswana Government Departments and the Botswana Mine Workers Union.
The retrenchment at Boseto will affect 85 of the 516 employees based at the site. It does not expect the
restructuring will have a material effect on production at the company's Boseto Operation. Ongoing
improvements in efficiencies and cost competitiveness will help to enable the Boseto Operation to
maintain long term sustainability in the world copper market. (Jan 14)

*World's biggest glacier in "irreversible retreat" - BBC News
The world's biggest glacier, Pine Island Glacier (PIG) that covers more than 160,000 sq km and drains
something like 20% of al lthe ice flowing off the west of Antartica, is now seen as in irreversible retreat,
even if the region were to experience much colder conditions, according to British Antartic Survey head Dr
Hilmar gudmundsson

Satellite and airborne measurements have recorded a marked thinning and a surge in velocity in recent
decades.

Its grounding line - the zone where the glacier enters the sea and lifts up and floats - has reversed tens of
km over the same period.

Much of this behaviour is driven not by higher air temperatures in the cold south but by warm ocean
bottom-waters getting under and eroding the floating ice shelf at the head of the glacier.

Key to PIG's observed behaviour is that a large section of it sits below sea level, with the rock bed sloping
back towards the continent.

Thinning rate The very latest satellite data details the thinning occurring in this region of West Antarctica

Page281of297©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Dr Gudmundsson's group, together with colleagues in the UK, France and China, have used numerical
models to describe PIG's current and future behaviour, and they argue that it has now entered just such a
mode.

"Even if you were to reduce melt rates, you would not stop the retreat," Dr Gudmundsson told BBC News.

"We did a number of model runs where we allowed PIG to retreat some distance back, and then we
lowered the melt rates in our models. And despite doing that, the grounding line continued to retreat.
