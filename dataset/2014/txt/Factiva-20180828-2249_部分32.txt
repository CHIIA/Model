Gas transporter APA Group has had its BBB credit rating confirmed by Standard & Poor's after it
agreed to pay about $6 billion for a BG Group gas pipeline in Queensland. However, equity analysts
have had mixed reactions to the deal.

S&P also maintained its stable outlook for APA's rating, pointing to the "certainty and cash flow stability
of APA's primarily regulated and highly contracted natural gas transmission pipeline operations,
including the QCLNG pipeline".

BG's Queensland Curtis pipeline, part of its $US20.4 billion LNG export venture in Queensland, is
underpinned by 20-year take-or-pay gas transportation contracts with subsidiaries of the UK gas major
and of its partner in the project, Chinese oil giant CNOOC. APA is raising about $1.84 billion in a
one-for-three renounceable rights issue to help fund the deal, so has halted trading pending the
institutional part of that sale. It is also taking on a two-year bridging loan of $US4.1 billion, which it
said it will look to gradually refinance as soon as possible through the US bank or bond markets.

S&P said funding strategy for the deal met APA's policy of maintaining gearing of 65 per cent to 68 per
cent.
Commonwealth Bank noted the metrics of the stand-alone acquisition of BG's pipelines "aren't
overwhelming". It said the value created through the deal, taking into account the debt, was only about
0.6¢ per security.
