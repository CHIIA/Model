Fortescue cuts spending

RESOURCES

By Peter Ker
Fortescue Metals Group will halve its spending on projects after taking the knife to its $US1.3 billion
($1.53 billion) capital budget for the 2015 financial year. The Perth-based miner on Friday joined Rio
Tinto and BHP Billiton in aggressively cutting capital, with it now set to spend just $US650 million this
financial year. But in an attempt to distance Fortescue from the two major miners, which have defended
export expansions amid weak commodity prices, chief executive Nev Power said the cuts were made
because "in the current environment it is prudent to defer investing additional capital that increases
supply into the market". The spending cut will see Fortescue's exploration budget savaged, and the
deferral of a $US100 million detrital processing plant, which was expected to treat 5 million tonnes per
year from mid 2015 onward.
The miner will also look for cheaper ways to complete the purchase of a group of very large ore carriers,
which are designed to lower freight costs to China. Fortescue said alternative funding or ownership
models for the large vessels were being investigated.Mr Power said the spending cuts would improve
cashflow while maintaining export guidance for the 2015 financial year at between 155 million tonnes
and 160 million tonnes. "We will maximise output from our world-class mining and infrastructure assets
and remain focused on factors within our control to ensure the efficiency of operations and cash
discipline to continue the program of early, voluntary debt repayment," he said. Fortescue said it would
complete the construction of its fifth berth at Port Hedland but would look to do so more efficiently. Iron
ore prices were fetching $US69.98 per tonne on Friday, less than half the price they were fetching on
December 9, 2013.
