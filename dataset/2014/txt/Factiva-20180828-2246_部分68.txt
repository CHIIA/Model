0841 GMT [Dow Jones] Ride-sharing app Uber has another controversy on its hands. The company
received a torrent of criticism online Monday after it automatically raised prices for riders in Sydney amid
an unfolding siege at a café. That was the result of an Uber algorithm underpinning its "surge pricing"
model, which charges customers more during times of high demand. Some users reported the minimum
fare had skyrocketed to $100 Australian dollars ($82) for a ride. Uber quickly backtracked, saying trips
out of the downtown area would be free for riders. Meanwhile, governments around the world continue to
question the company's legality, saying it competes unfairly with taxi firms, while earlier this month
allegations that an Uber driver raped a woman in India triggered a nationwide ban on
smartphone-enabled taxi services. (newley.purnell@wsj.com; Twitter: @Newley)

0834 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/TWD is slightly higher on thin volume, lifted by continued foreign fund
outflows, say two local traders. The pair closes at 31.342--the highest onshore closing level over 50
months, versus 31.326 late Friday. They say the local central bank is believed to have bought the USD
around 31.320 (versus 31.300 Friday) to keep the pair in its target band. "Most market participants
believe the New Taiwan dollar has room to depreciate more as its recent declines still lag behind other
regional currencies," a trader says. But buying in USD weakened after the USD/TWD rose above 31.330
as some investors turned cautious following rebounds in the JPY and the KRW and ahead of the FOMC
meeting, the trader adds. Foreign investors have been net sellers of local stocks for seven straight
sessions. (fanny.liu@wsj.com)

0818 GMT [Dow Jones]--SEB notes that today the Swedish Premium Pension Authority pays out annual
capital to various mutual funds chosen by Sweden's six million pension savers. Historically, a large
share of the funds are invested in foreign assets which results in negative SEK flows. The general
pattern is that EUR/SEK tends to rise ahead of PPM day, and keep on climbing for 5 days, turning down
on the sixth day until around 21 days after PPM day. The bank says if the cross follows this pattern, then
it will head higher until around December 22, and then fall around January 12. EUR/SEK traded at a
4-year high of 9.4180 both Friday and today, now at 9.4030. gary.stride@wsj.com

0807 GMT [Dow Jones] China government bonds are down as liquidity tightens with a slew of IPOs
hitting the market, increasing demand for cash ahead of the New Year holiday. The seven-year
government bond yield is up at 3.77% vs 3.74%. But investors aren't too worried about the bonds,
saying some bonds are starting to look appealing after their recent falls. On Thursday, 12 IPOs will start
to open subscriptions, expecting to raise around $2.2 billion in total. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0749 GMT [Dow Jones] The Indonesian rupiah plummeted to its weakest level since 1998 during the
Asian Financial Crisis, on Monday, as global investors retreat from risky markets and a commodity slide
hurts the country's finances. The Indonesia rupiah touched 12,695 against the U.S. dollar Monday and
last traded at 12,660. On Friday, the rupiah closed at 12,455. As the year draws to a close, money
managers are looking ahead to 2015 and cutting down on risky or vulnerable positions in emerging
markets like Indonesia. Many are also bracing for turmoil in emerging markets as the U.S. dollar
strengthens and growth in the U.S. beats much of the rest of the world. The rupiah started the year well,
climbing 7.5% until early April, with investors pinning their hopes on the election of pro-reform President
Joko Widodo, who would support a good mix of monetary policy and economic reform. But since he took
office in late July, the rupiah has fallen close to 9%. (anjani.trivedi@wsj.com; Twitter @anjani_trivedi)

0743 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank lending on real estate projects won't increase in the near term as demand
from developers hasn't increased, says Nguyen Tien Dong, head of the State Bank of Vietnam's Credit
Department. Dong says banks are still paying the price for their strong lending to properties projects 5-7
years ago. Several banks in Vietnam are burdened with high levels of bad debt, most of which are
associated with properties projects. Dong says banks' total outstanding loans will increase 12%-14% this
year, adding that lending has risen 11% year-to-date. (trong-khanh.vu@wsj.com; Twitter:

0736 GMT [Dow Jones] China's central bank is likely to inject more money into the banking system this
week, says UBS. "We think there is a need for policy support in order for liquidity to remain stable before
the Chinese New Year," it says. The marginal lending facility, used by the People's Bank of China to
inject CNY500 billion, is due to expire this week. This means the PBOC may choose to inject funds to
maintain liquidity, possibly a cut in the reserve requirement ratio, says UBS. (jacky.wong@wsj.com;

0728 GMT [Dow Jones] China's inflation target for 2015 will mean much more to investors than its goal
for economic growth, says CLSA. The CPI target "will give an indication of how much interest rates are
likely to be cut," says Francis Cheung, the brokerage's managing director of China-Hong Kong strategy.
The number "tells you how much easing is in the pipeline," he adds. The surprise rate cut from the
People's Bank of China has driven an 18.2% rally in the Shanghai Composite and a 7.5% gain for the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index since November 21. China's CPI rose 1.4% year-on-year in
November, decelerating to the lowest rate in five years, while a string of year-on-year declines in
producer prices is only months away from marking an unbroken three year deflation streak.

0722 GMT [Dow Jones] Vietnamese government says it has completed talks on a free trade agreement
with three Customs Union countries, including Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The Customs Union will
open its market for Vietnamese farm produce, seafood, garments, footwear products and wooden
furniture, the government says, adding that Vietnam will open its market for machinery and transport
means for the Customs Union. The agreement is expected to be officially signed early next year. The
FTA is expected to help boost annual trade between Vietnam and the three Customs Union countries to
$10 billion by 2020 from $2.7 billion in 2012. (trong-khanh.vu@wsj.com; Twitter: @TrongKhanhVu)

Page174of251©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.0640 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's equities market pared deep and broad losses as the day unfolded,
although an ongoing hostage drama in Sydney's business district and a gloomy fiscal update from the
federal government ensured shares finished lower for a fifth trading session in a row. The S&P/ASX 200
ended down 0.6% at 5186.1, having been as much as 1.4% lower earlier to echo sharp falls in Europe
and the U.S. as worries over global growth and falling oil prices build. BHP Billiton (BHP.AU) ended
down 0.5% at a fresh five-year low, Rio Tinto (RIO.AU) slipped 0.3% and smaller iron-ore producers BC
Iron (BCI.AU) and Arrium (ARI.AU) lost 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively. The banks were all lower. Qantas
(QAN.AU) fell 5.4%. Recall rallied 15% after rejecting a takeover offer from rival Iron Mountain.

0613 GMT [Dow Jones] Plummeting global resource prices could damage overall corporate profitability in
China as lower prices hit margins of most profitable, state-dominated upstream industries, such as oil
production, without benefiting highly competitive downstream sectors where companies have limited
pricing power, says Credit Suisse in a research report. Additionally, while China as a net resources
importer stands to benefit from low global commodity prices, the drop in prices adds to "deflationary
pressure on the country, and might trigger more aggressive policy response from the central bank," the
report says. (brian.spegele@wsj.com)

0557 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares end with a 0.4% loss at 8985.63 and analysts say the index will
likely to remain in doldrums for the next few weeks as most players are staying low ahead of the holiday
season. "Some people are waiting for the 4Q earning results but there is nothing immediate to sway the
market," says Henry Miao, a Nan Hua Securities analyst who expects the Taiex to drop to near 8900
Tuesday. Tech names are mostly mixed; world's largest chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) is up 0.7% to
NT$136 while Apple assembler Hon Hai (2317.TW) is down 2.1% to NT$87.70. Petrochemical shares
are still battered by falling global oil prices; Formosa Plastics (1301.TW) falls 1.9% to NT$66 and
Formosa Petrochemical (6506.TW) is down 3.0% at NT$63.70. (jenny.hsu@wsj.com)
