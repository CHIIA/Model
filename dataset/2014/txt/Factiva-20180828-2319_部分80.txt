Boart Longyear Restructures Debt, Raises Equity

SYDNEY--Boart Longyear Ltd. (BLY.AU), the world's largest supplier of drill rigs to the mining sector,
signed a deal with its biggest shareholder to restructure debt and raise equity, a move executives hope
will allow the company to ride out a downturn in global resources spending.

On Thursday, the Australian-listed company announced an agreement with U.S. investment
firmCenterbridge Partners LP to replace its covenant-laden bank debt with a new US$120 million
"covenant-lite" loan, which Boart said would decrease the risk of a default. Another loan of as much as
US$105 million will be available to fund a senior secured notes tender offer, it said.
Boart also expects to raise between US$119 million and US$127 million through a series of equity
raisings, the company said in a filing to the Australian Securities Exchange.

Utah-based Boart has sought to raise capital or sell assets since February, when it appointed Goldman
Sachs to carry out a strategic review in the wake of widening losses and high debts. The company had
since negotiated with lenders to relax financial covenants and replace restrictive bank loans with
long-dated high-yield notes.

"The recapitalization is an important step forward for Boart Longyear and its shareholders," Chief
Executive Richard O'Brien said. "We anticipate the recapitalization will provide the company with
significant liquidity to better weather the challenges of the current depressed markets for our drilling
services and products and the financial strength to allow more time for those markets to recover."
Centerbridge now owns 20% of the drilling company. A one-time darling of the resource-rich Australian
Securities Exchange, Boart rode the commodities boom as mining companies ventured deep into
African jungles and arid regions such as Mongolia's Gobi desert in search of new deposits to feed Asia's
demand.

However, Boart's share price has crashed from a 2007 high of more than A$22.00 to close Wednesday
at A$0.15 following a sharp downturn in global mining investment.

Miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) tightened their purse strings amid a
decline in the value of commodities such as coal and gold as China's economy cooled and the U.S.
looked to taper its bond-buying program. Budgets for exploration work were among the first, and
deepest, cuts.

Only four out of every 10 drilling rigs owned by Boart are in use, as many resources companies opted to
conserve cash rather than explore for new deposits of commodities such as iron ore, Boart said. The
company Thursday reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of US$12
million for the three months through September, compared to a US$1 million loss in the same period a
year earlier.
