The Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia has conditionally approved Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd.'s Iron Bridge magnetite iron ore mine, the Australian Associated Press reported June 23.

The project comprises the North Star and Glacier Valley deposits about 100 kilometers south of Port
Hedland, Western Australia.

The mine, in which Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group and China's Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. act as
joint venture partners, needs to meet 17 conditions, including the protection of certain animals in the
Pilbara region of Western Australia, before development can begin.
Assuming that the company can secure final approvals from the Western Australian environment minister
and federal government, the 15 million tonnes per annum operation could be in production by next year.
Iron Bridge would clear 5,141 hectares of native vegetation and will have a 45-year life of mine operation,
marking the company's first foray into magnetite iron ore. According to the report, the company is keen
to sell its 61% stake in the project to reduce debt obligations.
