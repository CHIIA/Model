STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Page117of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.for the year ended 30 June 2014
The directors are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair
presentation of the summary
consolidated financial statements of Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon Limited and
its subsidiaries. The summary
consolidated annual financial statements have been prepared in compliance
with the Listings Requirements
of the JSE Limited, the framework concepts and the measurement and
recognition requirements of
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), the requirements of
the International Accounting
Standards ("IAS") 34, Interim Financial Reporting, SAICA Financial Reporting
Guidelines as issued by the
Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the
Financial Reporting
Standards Council and the Companies Act of South Africa and include amounts
based on judgements and
estimates made by management. The directors have also prepared any other
information included in the
annual report and are responsible for both its accuracy and its consistency
with the summary
consolidated financial statements.
The directors acknowledge that, ultimately, they are responsible for the
system of internal financial
control established by the group and place considerable importance on
maintaining a strong control
environment. To enable the directors to meet these responsibilities, the
board sets standards for
internal control aimed at reducing the risk of error or loss in a
cost-effective manner.
The going-concern basis has been adopted in preparing the audited summary
consolidated financial
statements. Based on forecasts and available cash resources, the directors
have no reason to believe
that the company or the group will not be a going concern in the foreseeable
future. The viability of
the company and the group is supported by the audited summary consolidated
financial statements.
The preparation of the audited summary consolidated financial statements was
supervised by the Chief
Financial Officer, Charles Henwood CA(SA), and approved by the board of
directors on 29 August 2014 and
are signed on its behalf.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 30 June 2014
To the Shareholders of Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon Limited
The summary consolidated financial statements of Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon
Limited, contained in the
accompanying preliminary report, which comprise the summary consolidated
statement of financial position
as at 30 June 2014, the summary consolidated statements of financial
performance and other comprehensive

Page118of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and
related notes, are derived from
the audited consolidated financial statements of Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon
Limited for the year ended
30 June 2014. We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on those consolidated
financial statements in our
report dated 29 August 2014. Our auditor's report on the audited
consolidated financial statements
contained an Other Matter paragraph: Other reports required by the Companies
Act (refer below).
The summary consolidated financial statements do not contain all the
disclosures required by
International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa
as applicable to annual financial statements. Reading the summary
consolidated financial statements,
therefore, is not a substitute for reading the audited consolidated
financial statements.
Directors' Responsibility for the Summary Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the summary
consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
for preliminary reports, set
out in basis of preparation note to the summary financial statements, and
the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to summary financial statements,
and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
summary consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the summary consolidated
financial statements based on
our procedures, which were conducted in accordance with International
Standard on Auditing (ISA) 810,
Engagements to Report on Summary Financial Statements.
Opinion
In our opinion, the summary consolidated financial statements derived from
the audited consolidated
financial statements of Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon Limited for the year ended
30 June 2014 are
consistent, in all material respects, with those consolidated financial
statements, in accordance with
the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary
reports, set out in the basis
of preparation note to the summary financial statements and the requirements
of the Companies Act of
South Africa as applicable to summary financial statements.
Other reports required by the Companies Act
The other reports required by the Companies Act paragraph in our audit
report dated 29 August 2014
states that as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended
30 June 2014, we have read the Directors' Report, the Audit Committee's
Report and the Company
Secretary's Certificate for the purpose of identifying whether there are
material inconsistencies
between these reports and the audited consolidated financial statements.
These reports are the

Page119of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.responsibility of the respective preparers. The paragraph states that, based
on reading these reports,
we have not identified material inconsistencies between these reports and
the audited consolidated
financial statements. The paragraph furthermore states that we have not
audited these reports and
accordingly do not express an opinion on these reports. The paragraph does
not have an effect on the
summary consolidated financial statements or our opinion thereon.
Other Matter
We have not audited future financial performance and expectations by
management included in the
accompanying summary consolidated financial statements and accordingly do
not express any opinion
thereon.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Despite challenging conditions within certain sectors, the group's
construction divisions have delivered
a credible performance. However, the poor performance from the pipe factory
in Mozambique, Capital Star
Steel (CSS), has been of great concern and significantly affected the
overall financial performance of
the group. Reference to discontinued operations includes the trading results
for CSS, Symo Steel and
Krost (Pty) Ltd and the equity accounted income from Dywidag-Systems
International (Pty) Ltd (DSI).
Continuing operations
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 8,4% during the year,
however, approximately 3,2%
relates to the full consolidation of Capital Africa Steel from 1 July 2013.
Following strong growth of
24% in FY13, the Building and civil engineering division achieved moderate
growth of 7,2% in the current
year in what remains a buoyant private sector building market. The Roads and
earthworks division has
performed well to achieve revenue which is only marginally down (1,4%
decrease) from the prior year,
given the effect of very little activity in the mining sector both locally
and in Africa. Revenue from
the Australian businesses was essentially static in dollar terms (2,4%
decrease) and this was primarily
due to start-up delays on certain projects in the second half of the year.
In rand terms, revenue
increased by 2,4% after the effects of currency conversions. Revenue from
continuing operations within
the construction materials division amounted to R1,3 billion and relates to
the rebar, ready-mix and
aggregate businesses.
Operating profit from continuing operations before non-trading items
increased by 10,2% to R1 billion at
a margin of 4,0% compared to R939 million at 3,9% in FY13. Improvement in
building margins in the second
half of the year were unfortunately offset by declining margins in the Civil
engineering and Roads and
earthworks divisions due to the lack of work from the mining sector and
strong competition in the road
sector. The Australian construction margin returned to the 2,0% level in the
current year. Margins in

Page129of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.the materials businesses have been under severe pressure in the second half
particularly in the rebar
market and this is reflected in the disappointing margin achieved of 1,1%.
Discontinued operations
Subsequent to the business update released on SENS in June 2014 in which
shareholders were advised of
the effects of production constraints and poor trading conditions on the
value of non-current assets
within the pipe mill, CSS, as well as concerns over the future viability of
the business, a decision was
reached to dispose of Capital Star Steel. The trading losses within CSS
amount to R65 million for the
year and at 30 June FY14 the carrying amount of the factory was impaired by
R360 million. The shelving
and racking businesses, Symo (a division within CAS) and Krost (Pty) Ltd
were both disposed of during
the year and have also been disclosed as discontinued operations. The
management of CAS have furthermore
concluded a sale agreement in respect of DSI, a company supplying roof bolts
to the mining sector, and
the equity accounted earnings from this business are also included in
discontinued operations. Assets to
the value of R478 million net of the impairment of R360 million have been
classified as held-for-sale.
Associated liabilities amounted to R556 million and have also been
reclassified. The investment amount
in respect of DSI has also been classified as held-for-sale.
Earnings per share and headline earnings per share
The combined effect of the trading losses, impairment losses and disposal
losses have resulted in a
decrease in earnings per share of 30,8% from 1 104 cents per share in FY13
to 764 cents per share in
FY14. Headline earnings per share which excludes the effect of the
impairment and disposal losses
increased by 1,9% to 1 173 cents per share from 1 151 cents per share.
Earnings per share and headline
earnings per share, in respect of continuing operations, have increased by
15,4% and 11,4% respectively
over the comparative period.
Taxation
The effective tax rate of 30,1% is a result of foreign taxes raised in
higher tax rate jurisdictions and
withholding taxes levied on dividends repatriated during the period.
Cash
Cash generated from operations amounts to R797 million compared to R1 584
million generated in the
comparative period. The decrease in cash balances of R695 million at 30 June
FY14 is attributable to the
consolidation of a net overdraft of R264 million within the CAS group of
companies, the working capital
utilisation of R547 million and taxation paid of R548 million. Capital
expenditure during the period
amounted to R413 million against an authorised budget of R430 million and
depreciation amounted to
R355 million (2013: R277 million)
Changes in shareholding
On 1 July 2013, CAS acquired 10,0% of its share capital for an amount of
R15,9 million through a share
buy-back transaction, with the result that the group's shareholding
increased to 55,6%. In accordance

Page130of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.with IFRS 3: Business combinations, a loss of R1,9 million has been
recognised on the deemed disposal of
the group's 50,0% share in CAS and goodwill of R9 million was accounted for
on the re-acquisition of the
55,6% interest as a subsidiary.
Probuild repurchased equity from minority shareholders in the year under
review resulting in an increase
in the group's interest from 78,5% to 80,0% at a cost of R26 million. Debit
amounts of R13 million were
recognised in equity. Probuild also increased its interest from 60,0% to
84,0% within Monaco Hickey at a
cost of R12,7 million. Debit amounts of R2,8 million were recognised in
equity.
Contingent liabilities
Financial guarantees issued to third parties amount to R6,6 billion compared
to R4,7 billion issued as
at 30 June 2013.

Building
The strengthening of the building market observed towards the end of FY13
has continued through FY14 and
the division's work on-hand has grown steadily over the year. Margins have
shown some improvement during
the year, however, they remain competitive. The division continues to
negotiate the large majority of
its projects on the strength of its reputation for consistent reliable
delivery demonstrated with a
proven track record.
Despite the effects of difficult economic conditions on consumers'
disposable income, the retail sector
remains resilient particularly in Gauteng with new developments under
construction in the major city
areas of Tshwane, Midrand and Newtown in Johannesburg, as well as in the
more outlying areas of Orange
Farm, Heidelberg and Krugersdorp. Furthermore existing centres in Rosebank
and Sandton have
refurbishments and upgrades in progress. Various new offices for large
corporates further supported the
Gauteng market. In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), development in and around Umhlanga
and Ballito has grown
steadily since the opening of the King Shaka Airport. New corporate offices
have underpinned the KZN
division's growth this year although the healthcare sector, both public and
private, also contributed
strongly towards performance. In the Western Cape, growth in tourism has
supported demand for
residential apartments as well as ongoing development within the V&A
Waterfront, both of which have
provided a strong source of projects for the Cape division along with the
Kathu renewable energy project

Page131of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.which is now nearing completion. The Eastern Cape division has had a
challenging year with a significant
decrease in activity in the region. This together with some under-performing
contracts resulted in a
poor performance however the order book of the division has shown
improvement in the second half of
FY14. The successful completion and handover of the FAW truck assembly plant
was a highlight of the
year.
The expansion of the division's geographical footprint into Africa continues
to gain traction with the
award of two additional shopping centres in Ghana during the year to replace
the West Hills Mall
development which is nearing completion.
Civil engineering
The Kusile Power Station continues to contribute strongly towards revenue
for the Civil engineering
division particularly in the context of persistent pressure on
mining-related infrastructure projects
during the current downward trend in activity from the mining sector. In
Zambia the division completed
the Ndola Brewery for SAB Miller during the year and has established various
relationships with other
clients which provide sufficient projects to retain a presence in the region
in the short to medium
term.

Subdued activity within the global mining sector has resulted in fewer
available mining projects and a
heavier weighting of the work on-hand toward roadwork, mostly in South
Africa, in recent years. The
absence of an anchor mining project in West Africa together with the
competitive nature of the roads
market continues to affect the overall margin of the Roads and earthworks
division which has dropped to
8,3% in FY14 (FY13: 9,9%).
Revenue from the South African businesses (including the SADC regions) was
broadly in line with that of
the previous year. Increased revenue from the ancillary works at the Kusile
Power Station and the Husab
Uranium mine in Namibia offset lower SA revenue from the Pipeline division.
Increased revenue from the
North South Carrier Pipeline contributed towards revenue from Botswana
exceeding R1 billion in FY14. In
our interim report we reported on delays affecting the NSC project caused by
heavy flooding. The time
lost due to the floods and the resulting repair work done in the second half
of the year has placed the
project behind programme which is affecting profitability, however, the
mining and airport projects in
Botswana performed well. In Mozambique revenue grew by 16,0% following the
start of the EN4 road
rehabilitation contract for Trans African Concessions (TRAC). This revenue
growth in Botswana and

Page132of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Mozambique has substantially offset a sharp decline in revenue in West
Africa which consisted mainly of
ad hoc maintenance type work in FY14, with reduced teams in both Ghana and
Sierra Leone. Both Edwin and
Roadspan performed well during the year.

Probuild
Revenue from Probuild decreased by 7,3% in dollar terms, however, this is
primarily due to secured
projects starting later than anticipated in the latter half of the year
rather than a decrease in
activity. Demand within the Australian building market has been
strengthening in recent years due to an
increase in Asian developers investing in residential apartments while
developers within the retail
market have now also begun delivering large scale retail developments to the
construction market. These
buoyant conditions are reflected in the growth in activity levels of 29% in
FY13 which have been
maintained through FY14.
The revenue from each of the divisions within the business was comparable
with that of the previous
period with the marginal decline originating from Melbourne and Monaco
Hickey. From a profitability
perspective the FY14 performance improved significantly following the
completion of the three loss-
making projects reported on in FY13. Monaco Hickey which operates in the
pharmaceutical market has
however experienced a slow-down. A number of residential towers were
completed during FY14 with three
new towers now under construction. Construction on the Eastland, Chadstone
and Werribee shopping centres
is progressing well.
WBHO Civil
Revenue grew by 33,6% in FY14 supported by the $113 million anchor project
at the Burrop Technical
Ammonia Nitrate Facility in the Pilbara as revenue from mining related
projects continued to taper.
As part of a strategy to diversify away from a heavy reliance on mining
work, WBHO Civil has started a
roads and special projects division, however, penetration into these new
markets has been slower than
anticipated.

Improvements within the building market have yet to filter through to the
construction materials markets
which supply into it. This combined with the effects from the stagnant
mining sector, saw conditions
actually deteriorate in the second six months of the year. Over-supply,
declining margins and rising
input costs over this period diluted what had been a promising first six
months from these businesses.
In respect of the pipe supply market, the slower growth of the Chinese
economy in recent years has
resulted in an over-supply of pipe within the global market which has driven
prices down while steel
prices increased and demand has decreased in the SA pipe market over the
same period. A decision by the
Capital Africa Steel board to sell CSS was reached.
Order book and prospects

All stands at the Simbithi Eco Estate near the King Shaka International
Airport in KZN have now been
sold with only a few stands remaining to be transferred in the FY15 year.
Sales at the golf course
development at St Francis in the Eastern Cape remain lacklustre and while no
improvement is anticipated
by management in the short-term.

R21,9 billion reflects a
general improvement in the order books across each of the divisions within
the group but is
predominantly the result of a 111,7% increase in the Australian book. The
strength of the Australian
book has diluted the contribution from Africa (including South Africa) to
36,7% (2013: 50,6%).
South Africa and the rest of Africa
The current strength within the local building market is expected to persist
in the short to medium
term. With demand at these levels the Building division is able to be more
selective in terms of the
projects it undertakes. Margins have however reached industry norms and the
scope for further
enhancement is limited. Looming saturation within local markets together
with a demand for retail
infrastructure in other African countries has resulted in local developers
expanding their geographical
footprint in recent years. This trend is expected to continue and the
African Building team is pursuing
various opportunities in this regard.
It is pleasing that the Roads and earthworks division has secured over R1
billion of bus rapid transport
contracts in the current year. Subdued mining activity throughout Africa is
impacting both the civil
engineering and roads and earthworks divisions. Both divisions have been
awarded further work for
GlencoreCoal at the colliery in Tweefontein during the second six months. It
was with disappointment
that we were formally advised by Exxarro of the termination of the Mayoko
project in the Congo in July
2014, for which the division was the preferred contractor. Projects in Ghana
remain of a smaller nature
yet are sufficient to retain a full-time presence in-country. The West
African team continues to pursue
opportunities in various countries. New projects have not received the
necessary support from financial
institutions.
The group's Projects team recently reached financial close on two
concessions incorporating design and
construct projects; the first being serviced accommodation for the
Department of Statistics (Stats SA)
in Tshwane and the second a gas-fired power station in Mozambique. The Stats
SA contract will be
executed by the group's building division in joint venture with local
empowerment contractors while the
civil works for the power station will be executed by the Roads and
earthworks division.
Australia
Probuild has secured all three of the large scale retail projects brought to
the Victorian (Melbourne)
market in the last 12 months, two of which are in excess of $350 million.
These projects will generate
strong revenue streams for Probuild over the next two years. Furthermore,
Probuild is the preferred
contractor on a number of residential towers, one of which is 77 stories.
During the year Probuild
identified an opportunity to enter the Queensland (Brisbane) market and in a
relatively short period of
time has secured projects to the value $334 million, $298 million of which
was awarded post 30 June 2014

Page135of186©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.and is not included in the order book above. Market conditions in the New
South Wales (Sydney) market
have also improved in the second half of FY14 and Probuild have concentrated
their efforts on raising
the profile of their brand with the financial institutions and developers
there in order to negotiate
larger scale projects.
The outlook for WBHO Civil has deteriorated in the second half of FY14. As
in Africa, the lack of mining
activity has impacted the work on-hand, while the scarcity of large scale
projects has seen margin
contraction on what work is available. However, the company continues to
secure ongoing maintenance type
projects in its traditional markets on various industrial plants.
Diversification into the roads market
as well as other markets will remain a strategic focus looking forward.
SAFETY
The group's LTIFR has shown significant improvement in FY14 decreasing from
1,35 at 30 June 2013 to
0,94 at 30 June 2014. This is within the group's target of less than one and
is largely attributable to
a significant improvement in Australia where the LTIFR decreased from 5,31
to 1,60 during the year after
a focused drive from the management team. We regret to report that two
work-related fatalities occurred
during the year and we extend our sincere condolences to the families,
friends and colleagues of these
employees.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
Subsequent to the resignation of Mr JP Botha and the appointment of Mr R
Gardiner reported upon in our
interim results in February, there have been no further changes to the board
during the year.
APPRECIATION
The directors and management would like to thank all stakeholders especially
our employees for their
continuous commitment, hardwork and loyalty in what has been a particularly
challenging year.
