Debt-ridden Lanco Infratech is selling its Australian unit Griffin Coal Mining Company to reduce debt
as stated by Livemint.
The company had purchased the Australian unit for $665 Mn in 2011. Along with the sale of Griffin
Coal Mining Co, Lanco Infratech is also in talks to divest a hydroelectric power plant in India.

Lanco Infratech is also signing a corporate debt restructuring agreement for R7500 Cr to restructure
debt that reached to R33900 Cr in September and will also give it access to new credit of R3500 Cr.
Its lenders include State Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd and
Lanco acquired the mine, which is estimated to have reserves of 1.2 billion tonnes, to secure fuel for
its upcoming projects. Griffin Coal Mining, located in Western Australia, produces 4 million tonnes
of coal every year. Lanco had plans to invest over Australian $1 billion more to scale up the output
to 18 million tonnes by 2018.

Gurgaon headquartered Lanco Infratech Limited has been driving growth in the domains of
Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), Power, Solar, Natural Resources and
Infrastructure. The company runs a 70-megawatt hydropower plant in Himachal Pradesh.
The infrastructure company posted a loss of R31.6 Cr in Q4, against a profit of R72.7 Cr for the
corresponding previous period. For the financial year ended March 31, 2013, the company posted a
loss of R1,073.3 Cr (R112 Cr loss previous year). Income for the financial year was down 1 per cent
at R15, 259 Cr.
Referring to divestment in wind and solar units, Lanco recently sold its 10 MW wind farm in
Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu to a spinning mill.
In January 2012, the company was seeking to raise as much as $750 Mn by selling a stake in its
power business to PE investors.

Last year, Kolkata-based CESC was acquiring Lanco Infratech’s Budhil Hydro Power, a 70 MW
hydro power project in Himachal Pradesh for about R750 Cr.
In 2012, debt-laden Lanco Infratech was set to raise $2 Bn from Chinese banks and financial
institutions.
In this space, Jindal Steel was planning to buy a coal based power plant at Nellore, Andhra Pradesh
from Kineta Power; HCC was planning to raise up to R1,000 Cr by selling stake in real estate and
non- core infrastructure assets for paring some of its debt and reducing the strain on its balance
sheet.

Other companies such as DLF, GMR Infrastructure and GVK Power and Infrastructure, among
others, are also looking at divesting stake in projects and subsidiaries, besides selling assets, to
raise funds to pay off debt.
