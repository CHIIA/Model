SHANGHAI -- China's Bright Food Group Co. said it is on the hunt for more international deals, and
that it plans initial public offerings for two of its earlier acquisitions.

Bright Food, which bought Weetabix Food Co. two years ago, is planning to list the U.K.
breakfast-cereal maker in Hong Kong or London, said Ge Junjie, Bright's vice president, in a news
briefing Thursday. It also is planning a listing of Manassen Foods Australia Pty. Ltd., but has no time
frame, Mr. Ge said.

Meanwhile, he said, Bright is looking for dairy, sugar and wine deals across the globe. The
Shanghai-based company, known for its dairy products and White Rabbit candy, is "in discussion"
with Irish dairy-products groupGlanbia PLC, Mr. Ge said. He declined to offer more details.
Bright -- which also sells products such as pork and ice cream -- is an example of a Chinese company
that is looking overseas to secure resources for the Chinese market. It has opened its wallet in the
past few years for a string of outbound acquisitions.
In October, Bright acquired a majority stake in Italian olive-oil maker Salov Group for an undisclosed
amount. Also in October, it extended a deadline to acquire a 56% stake in Israeli dairy
companyTnuva Food Industries Ltd. to Jan. 5, its second three-month extension of a billion-dollar
transaction that was expected to close two months ago. Bright Food hasn't disclosed how much it is
paying for the Tnuvastake, but people familiar with the matter said earlier the transaction valued Tnuva
at roughly $2.4 billion.
In 2011, Bright acquired a 75% stake in Australia-focused Manassen Foods Australia from Champ
Private Equity.

Mr. Ge said that Bright plans to raise 20% to 30% of market valuation for Weetabix and Manassen. He
declined to offer valuation and financial details.

Bright has said it is planning to launch a financial arm for its overseas mergers and acquisitions and to
bring together capital for the entire company.
The company said its revenue reached 106.9 billion yuan ($17.5 billion) in 2013, up 18% from a year
earlier.
With the expansion of China's economy, Bright said it expects a higher demand for food in its home
country. Bright also plans to expand its retail division, including Hao De convenience stores and Nong
Gong Shang supermarkets.
Mr. Ge on Thursday didn't respond to questions on whether the situation of the company's former
chairman, Wang Zongnan, has affected its international ambitions. Shanghai government's
prosecutor's office said in August it approved the arrest of Mr. Wang, a retired Communist Party
official, on suspicion of bribery and embezzlement.

The party said late last year that Mr. Wang had retired from Bright Food. Mr. Wang had won credit for
leading the state-owned company's acquisition of foreign brands, most notably the 2012 acquisition

its overseas strategy. It isn't possible to reach Mr. Wang for comment.

The jobs are political appointments.
