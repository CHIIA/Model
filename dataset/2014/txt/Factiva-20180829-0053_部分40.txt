Australia's Balamara Resources said Monday it had secured a $5 million investment for its flagship
Nowa Ruda coking coal project in Poland from major shareholder Hong Kong-based Ample Skill, which
will also give the latter a direct 15% stake in the project.Ample Skill currently holds 37% stake in
Balamara. Nowa Ruda was put under care and maintenance at the end of 1995 due to low coking coal
prices as well as inefficient cost structure. With the latest funding, Balamara now intends to complete the
project's feasibility study by the end of first quarter 2015, in order to progress quickly to permitting and
funding. The Perth-based company is targeting first production in 2017 at a rate of 1 million mt/year. But
this could be higher, as Balamara is looking at the application of modern mining methods in its feasibility
study, a company spokesman said Monday. "Offtake is likely to be sold into the domestic market in
Poland as there are a number of coke plants nearby," he added.

Located in southwestern Poland, Nowa Ruda is close to several coke plants owned by ArcelorMittal and
Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa. They were the preferred choices to sell the coal to, the company said
previously.
