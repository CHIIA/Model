TPG Capital has tapped Lazard Group LLC to find a buyer for its Australian gas and electricity retailer
Alinta Energy, powering up a sale that is expected to value the company at as much as A$4 billion
($3.54 billion).
"Alinta Energy's owners are exploring future ownership options for the company," Alinta said in a
statement issued Tuesday. "This process was always intended as part of Alinta Energy's private equity
ownership structure."

A sale, which is likely to take place in early 2015, would end TPG's about-three-year stewardship of
Alinta. The Fort Worth-based PE group took control of Alinta in 2011, when it led a consortium of
creditors in a debt-for-equity swap that wiped out A$2.8 billion of loans and halted Alinta's slide into
bankruptcy.
TPG paid between 50 cents and 70 cents on the dollar to accrue about A$650 million of Alinta's debt,
before recouping about A$270 million of the investment during a debt restructuring.
The timing of the sale appears designed to bring Alinta to market ahead of a planned privatization of
power assets by the state governments of New South Wales and Queensland. The NSW government, in
June, announced plans to sell a 50% stake in the electricity grid for about A$20 billion. Queensland in
September said it will sell a long-term lease on its electricity grid for about A$28 billion. Both
privatizations have been penciled in for 2015.

Sydney-based Alinta supplies natural gas and electricity to about 800,000 homes and businesses,
principally in Western Australia. It also operates power stations with about 2,500 megawatts of base
load, a thermal coal mine, a gas transmission pipeline and is developing a solar thermal power project.

Alinta was established in 2000 with the privatization of the West Australia government's power
generation, gas trading, sales and transmission businesses.
TPG and its advisers are likely to seek a trade sale but will also consider an initial public offering,
according to an unsourced report in Australia's Sydney Morning Herald. TPG did not immediately
respond to a request for confirmation of its intentions.
Potential trade buyers include Australia's three largest energy retailers AGL Energy Ltd., Origin Energy
Ltd. and CLP Group's EnergyAustralia, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. All three have
significant assets on Australia's east coast and could be attracted by the opportunity to expand to
Australia's west coast.
Australia's energy assets have been in demand this year, though interest may have been tempered in
recent months by fears of an economic slowdown linked to China's slowing growth.
In May, Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. struck a A$2.4 billion deal for
Australian gas transporter Envestra Ltd. In June, AGL Energy finalized its A$1.5 billion acquisition of
state-owned Macquarie Generation.
