Iron ore explorer Gindalbie Metals has announced it will recognise an impairment charge of $640
million for its investment in Karara Mining, after conducting an impairment test review.
The company cited capacity restrictions, a lower than forecast iron ore price and a higher than
anticipated Australian dollar as key factors behind the impairment of the project located 200
kilometres east of Geraldton.

The price of iron ore has fallen by nearly a third since this time last year.
Karara has invested more than $1 billion in the project, including a dedicated 16mtpa export facility
at Geraldton port, utilities connections and an 85 kilometre rail line, all of which will be common use
infrastructure.
Earlier this year, Chinese steelmaker and joint venture partner Ansteel increased its stake in
Karara Mining to 52.1 per cent, whilst Gindalbie holds 47.8 per cent.
Ansteel had provided $60 million in loans to Karara in 2013, on the provision that it could convert
those into equity, and also holds an option to extend its equity to 62 per cent in exchange for
providing $230 million in working capital.

Ansteel's nominee Chen Ping was also appointed managing director at Karara at that time.

Gindalbie said it expected magnetite output to reach 75 per cent of capacity but would be fighting
bottlenecks in its tailings system.

In April, Gindalbie managing director Dale Harris stepped down from his role to directly oversee
Karara as chief executive officer.

Gindalbie fell 15.5 per cent on the news, to 4.9 cents per share, continuing a slump from over 17
cents per share this time last year.
The company says the impairment charge will be recorded in its 2014 financial year accounts, but
won't affect its ability to continue to operate its business.
