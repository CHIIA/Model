Australia’s IMX Resources said Monday it had negotiated an agreement with Flinders Ports in regards to
its port handling contract for the Cairn Hill iron ore mine, which ceased production in June.Termite
Resources — the entity which operates IMX’s 51% Cairn Hill mine — went into administration in June,
which caused mining to be stopped at the South Australian operation. Cairn Hill is located 55 km from
the town of Coober Pedy and is a joint venture between IMX and Chinese trader Sichuan Taifeng, which
holds the remaining 49% stake. Termite operates the mine on behalf of the JV partners. “Flinders Ports
has agreed to not make any claim on the port guarantee until July 2015, in exchange for which IMX has
granted Flinders Ports security over IMX’s Mt Woods tenements,” IMX said in a statement. Mt Woods,
also located in South Australia, is scheduled to start production in late 2017. But its development is
dependent upon the company securing a partner.

Production from the Mt Woods project is expected to range between 2.5 million mt/year and 3.5 million
mt/year.
