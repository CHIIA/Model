The billionaire is looking to increase live cattle exports BILLIONAIRE Andrew Forrest is poised to
become a central figure in the nation’s push to become a major food exporter to China after buying
Western Australia’s biggest beef producer, Harvey Beef, in a deal worth more than $30 million.
Mr Forrest, who already owns vast cattle stations in WA’s Pilbara region, bought the company from
Hong Kong-based private equity fund Pacific Alliance Group.

The deal confirms speculation that Mr Forrest believes in the potential growth in demand for Australian
beef in the same way he successfully predicted 10 years ago that his mining company, Fortescue
Metals, would benefit from China’s soaring demand for iron ore.
The largely untapped Chinese market is seen as the holy grail for the Australian beef industry, both
for processed beef and live cattle exports.
Mr Forrest, who is cashed up after reaping dividends worth hundreds of millions of dollars in recent
years from his holding in Fortescue, is believed to be pursuing a separate deal with agribusiness
company Elders that would open up live cattle exports to China.
It is understood he has met senior Chinese government officials with the aim of relaxing quarantine
laws.
Harvey Beef is WA’s only accredited exporter of beef to China. It also exports to Japan, Korea,
Indonesia, Taiwan, the Middle East, the US and more than 20 other countries.

The business processes about 145,000 grass and grain fed animals each year, employing about 300
people.
Mr Forrest’s private company, Minderoo, said yesterday it would invest in upgrading Harvey Beef’s
facilities, in WA’s southwest, to increase capacity in order to meet growing domestic and international
demand for WA beef.
“I have always been a firm believer and an even stronger supporter of the Australian agri-cultural
industry,” Mr Forrest said.

“Harvey Beef has been an iconic brand for almost a century and I am delighted to work with its team to
ensure Harvey Beef makes a significant and growing contribution to the state’s economy and
Australia’s agricultural industry for the next century.” The Australian revealed in January that Mr
Forrest had become one of WA’s biggest individual landholders after acquiring two vast Pilbara cattle
stations from the collapsed empire of former tycoon Ric Stowe for $4.5m.

The deal tripled the size of his pastoral land to 7300sq km — an area roughly six times the size of New
York City.

120 years apart from an 11-year stretch from 1998 to 2009.

Harvey Beef was founded by Ernest Green in 1919 and owned by the family until 2005.
Mr Forrest outbid another local buyer, the Craig Mostyn Group, as well as Chinese and Japanese
investors.Harvey Beef chief executive Michael Hughes said the sale was an excellent result .
