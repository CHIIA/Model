Heavily indebted French electricity giant GDF Suez is considering selling another stake in its
Australian subsidiary in a deal expected to top $500 million.
Last year the company offloaded a 28 per cent stake in four power stations across Victoria and
South Australia to the Japanese trading house, Mitsui & Co .

The investment in the gas, coal and wind power generators totalled around $480 million.

It's understood an even greater slice may now be shopped around in the same assets, as GDF
Suez , which is 36.7 per cent owned by the French government and ranks as the world's largest
power producer by output, grapples with a debt burden of close to $34 billion.
The hefty sum arose from its 2012 acquisition of Britain's International Power, which owned assets
throughout South America, the Middle East, South-East Asia as well as Australia.
Deutsche Bank has been drafted in to sell the stake, which is likely to be structured in a similar
manner to the Mitsui transaction.

According to sources negotiations with potential bidders have been under way for some time.

RATCH-Australia , a joint venture between Thailand's Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding and
Transfield Services , is viewed as a logical contender. Chinese companies have also circled a
number of power plants in Australia recently.

However some argue GDF Suez faces an uphill battle given the systemic problems in the electricity
market as excess capacity continues to weigh on wholesale prices.
In the Mitsui deal, the Japanese firm gained a portion of a bundle of power plants, including the
coal-fired generator in Victoria, along with GDF Suez 's power and gas retail business, which has
over 350,000 customers .
Under the deal GDF Suez and Mitsui formed a fresh subsidiary vehicle, giving the Japanese firm a
n equity interest in all of the French giant's power businesses in Australia.

News of this latest prospective deal comes as the market awaits a ruling on AGL's disputed
$1.5 billion purchase of the Macquarie Generation assets - country's largest power producer.

It is understood the high level of borrowings forced GDF Suez out of the MacGen race as it pursues
a selective sell-down of assets post the International Power deal.
Earlier this year, Commonwealth Bank sold its 8.16 per cent share in Hazelwood. The brown-coal
fired station provides about a quarter of Victoria's power.
