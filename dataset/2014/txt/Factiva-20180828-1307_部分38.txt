The former Matilda Bay Brewery site in North Fremantle has been sold to a Chinese development
group for $36 million.
The sale was brokered by commercial real estate agency Knight Frank on behalf of the property's
owners, the McGilvray family, who have owned the site since the 1980s.

The identity of the Chinese developer was not disclosed.
Knight Frank managing director John Corbett said the property covered 2.9 hectares with three
street frontages.
Mr Corbett said the property had potential to yield a development of up to 60,000 square meters,
with up to 800 apartments and additional commercial space the likely outcomes, subject to council
approval.

The building that formerly housed the production facility for Matilda Bay Brewing Co is heritage listed
and will need to be incorporated in any development proposal.
"We had a high level of interest in this property from local and international developers keen to
create a landmark development that could take full advantage of the spectacular location," Mr
Corbett said.

Also today, Knight Frank has been appointed to sell or lease a food processing facility at 2 Powell
Street, Osborne Park.
The site was previously home to the British Sausage Company.

Knight Frank is offering two adjoining units for a combined price of $1.85 million or for rent at
$125,000 per annum.

The units have a combined area of 925sqm.
"This property would ideally suit someone already in the food processing industry who is looking to
owner-occupy or relocate to larger premises," Knight Frank selling agent Sam Hammond said.
"The property will be sold or leased with vacant possession, so the new owner or tenant could
begin operations straight away."
Meanwhile, commercial real estate agency Burgess Rawson has brokered a five-year lease at the
first stage of a new industrial building in Callaway Street, Wangara, to SPX Flow Technology
Australia.
SPX will take up 2,100sqm at the site until mid-2019, while it also holds options to extend the lease.

The second stage, comprising a 2,205sqm office warehouse, is available to lease at an annual rate
of $276,625.

tenants are being more selective about their future commitments but well designed, flexible buildings
are getting leased," Burgess Rawson director Chad Henville said.
