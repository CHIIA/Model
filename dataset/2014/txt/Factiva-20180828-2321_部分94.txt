Tony Poli is keeping mum on speculation he is poised to use some of his takeover windfall to buy the
stalled Port Geographe residential development.

Sources yesterday suggested a deal had already been done, with Mr Poli reported to have outbid a
number of property companies for the beachside project.

However, while neither confirming or denying involvement, the former Aquila Resources chief said
from Melbourne last night that “we haven’t entered into any sales agreements for Port Geographe”.
“We’ve been looking at lots of properties,” said Mr Poli, who pocketed $400 million from the joint
takeover of Aquila by Aurizon and China’s Baosteel earlier this year.

“I’ve got some guys working for me and they’re the ones that would be running with various things.”

Port Geographe, 10km outside of Busselton, was launched as a canals development. But it is only
partly completed after the collapse of the developer — a joint venture between Macquarie Group,
Luke Saraceni and Axiom Properties — in August 2011.

It left the Westpac-owned St George Bank owed $100 million.

The collapse was blamed on falling house prices and the environmental obligations of the developer to
remove toxic seaweed which had piled up on Geographe Bay because of groynes built to keep the
development’s canals open. PPB Advisory put the undeveloped part of the project up for sale through
Savills, offering a 59ha plot plus 32 stock lots.

Expressions of interest closed at the end of May.
