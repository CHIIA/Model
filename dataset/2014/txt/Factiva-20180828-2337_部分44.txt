0753 GMT [Dow Jones] Affin Research tips aggressive investors to buy KLCI futures on breakout above
1850 for bigger upside towards an all-time high of 1900. The house notes the KLCI's close above the
200-day moving average suggests the longer-term trend turning positive, while other technical indicators
remain in the positive zone. "Strategy wise, given that the short-term trend has turned positive toward
1870, traders should accumulate and capitalize on weaker ringgit and ride on upturns in economically
sensitive sectors before the bullish year end," says Affin Head of Retail Strategy Nazri Khan Adam.
Conservative investors may buy stocks such as Malayan Banking (1155.KU), Hong Leong Bank
(5819.KU) and Bursa Malaysia (1818.KU), he adds. The KLCI is down 0.2% at 1846.58.

0750 GMT [Dow Jones] Traditional banks may go out of business in a decade if they don't adapt to
revolutions in technology, changing customer behavior and new regulations, a PwC report says. Existing
bank business models will be challenged by non-banks, such as Google, Alibaba and mobile operators,
who provide more core banking services. The speed of technological advance can alter the cost structure
of entire industries. "The biggest question for banks will be how to maintain proper focus and investment
while keeping an eye on customer transactions to other players in the value chain." Regulators' strategic
objectives can be clouded by political expediency and need to be adapted to. However, the report points
that brands and trust will determine how and with whom customers choose to

0746 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian shares broke a two-day recovery with mining stocks leading a decline
after iron-ore prices dropped to a fresh five-year low. The S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.3% to 5363, its lowest
finish since mid-April. The index has now fallen more than 5% since it hit a more than six-year closing
high in early September. Heavily weighted BHP Billiton (BHP.AU) dropped 1.8% and Rio Tinto (RIO.AU)
sank 2.5%. Smaller iron-ore producers were even harder hit, with Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.AU)
falling 4.8%, BC Iron (BCI.AU) losing 6.3% and Atlas Iron (AGO.AU) letting go of 5.4%. Dividend
yield-rich banking stocks, which outperformed the wider market in the previous two years, were again
under pressure. Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AU), Westpac Banking (WBC.AU), Australia & New Zealand
Banking (ANZ.AU) and National Australia Bank (NAB.AU) lost between 1.8% and 2.4% for the day.

0702 GMT [Dow Jones] India's state-run banks need to raise up to $37 billion through to financial year
2019 to fully meet Basel III norms, says Moody's. This estimate assumes a moderate economic recovery
and a gradual decline in bad loans. "Indian public sector banks barely meet current minimum capital

Page117of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.requirements, and we anticipate that they will find it difficult to raise capital quickly in the current
environment," says Gene Fang, a Moody's vice president. Banks may tap share markets to raise capital
but, with their equity values low, banks would struggle to raise the full required amount through that route
alone, says Moody's. (nupur.acharya@wsj.com)

0653 GMT [Dow Jones] Economists expect Thailand to maintain a trade deficit in August as exports
contract. HSBC expects Thai overseas shipment to fall 1.1% year-on-year as it adjusts to a deceleration
of trade with Japan and Europe. The markets combined account for nearly 20% of Thailand's total
exports. Thailand's exports trend is bucking the wider market, where the trade data of north Asian
economies and Singapore reflect an improving trade account. An analysis unit within Tisco, a
Bangkok-based investment group, expects Thailand will resister a 5.6% drop (year-on-year) in August
exports while the pace of import contraction should ease. (warangkana.chomchuen@wsj.com)

0638 GMT [Dow Jones] Analysts at BNP Paribas expect the dollar to continue to strengthen against the
euro, supported by higher short-end US Treasury yields. "[U.S. Treasuries] two-year yields remain key
and even having finished the past week near the highs, the front end rate structure is still considerably
more dovish on the path of policy rate hikes than the Fed's updated 'dot' forecasts. In turn, the USD's
positive link to front-end yield differentials has been strongly restored over the past month, implying that
strong economic data continues to be the best recipe for dollar strength." EUR/USD at 1.2862, two-year
Bunds at -0.071% and two-year USTs at 0.555%. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0631 GMT [Dow Jones]--Bund futures open the week nearly a quarter point higher following the subdued
net TLTRO demand last Thursday, crumbling inflation expectations, rising EM jitters and fragile risk
sentiment, according to analysts at Commerzbank. "The strong rally on Friday and the firm opening
today blur the risk-return pattern for tactical longs but with further support for Bunds looming from the
expected set of weak PMIs tomorrow buying on dips looks set to prevail today." December Bunds trade
0.29 higher at 148.78 and the 10-year cash yields 0.97%. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0617 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank of America-Merrill Lynch upgraded its forecast for the Indian rupee, despite
Fed tapering and the likely end of loose monetary policy in the U.S. The bank expects the rupee to
remain in a INR58-62 range against the USD, despite the strength of the US currency. It should end the
year at INR61 vs the USD and strengthen to INR60 by the end of 2015, up from the INR64 previously
expected. Lower oil prices and gold import curbs will shrink India's current account deficit to 1.7% of
GDP next year. A more stable price outlook and improvements in the central bank's management of the
currency are also expected to lure back foreign investors. "Inflation has peaked, and along with more
credible RBI monetary policy, will encourage portfolio inflows, allowing the RBI to cut rates and reduce
the need for nominal INR depreciation," BAML analysts said. (gabriele.parussini@wsj.com)

0608 GMT [Dow Jones] The party of Indonesia's President-elect Joko Widodo estimates they can save
around IDR600 trillion (US$50 billion) for next year by cutting, among other expenses, routine spending
in government institutions, and non-fuel subsidies, without the need to increase subsidized fuel prices,
says party lawmaker Dolfie Palit. Widodo's team is still calculating the best option--whether to raise
subsidized fuel prices this year or next year, he says. "The impact on the poor people is the main
consideration before the decision is made." Economists and businessmen have urged the government to
raise subsidized fuel prices not only to rein in the budget deficit, but also to reduce fuel imports that have
been keeping the current account in deficit and clouding investor confidence on the rupiah.

0546 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan stocks end down 1.1% at 9134.65, as foreign investors unload shares for
a ninth consecutive session on economic and political concerns, says Hua Nan Securities assistant vice
president Henry Miao. "The potential end of quantitative easing in the U.S. continues to be a concern," he
says. "Investors are also uncertain if the upcoming elections in Taiwan will result in policy changes." Tech
heavyweights lead the declines, with TSMC (2330.TW) falling 2.4% to NT$122.00, UMC (2303.TW)
declining 1.5% to NT$12.75, and Hon Hai (2317.TW) down 0.5% at NT$100.50. The Taiex is tipped for a
9100-9150 band for Tuesday. (eva.dou@wsj.com)

0543 GMT [Dow Jones] The Indian rupee rises slightly to 60.78 from its Friday close of 60.85, but the
daily chart suggests it will remain in a slim range against the U.S. dollar in the near term. USD/INR rests
in a consolidation zone spanning 60.42-60.89 after falling out of the daily Bollinger uptrend channel last
week. The rupee rose on news of sizeable investment pledges from China as well as Japan. Long-USD
positions--bets on U.S. interest rates rising sooner--were pared after China on Thursday pledged $20
billion over five years to build industrial parks in two Indian states. Apart from the cross-border inflows
that ought to boost the rupee's value, the broader implication of increasing foreign direct investment is a
boon for Indian assets. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

0522 GMT [Dow Jones] A fall in big mining and banking stocks is driving the Australian market lower.
The S&P/ASX 200 is near the lows of the day, down 1.4% at 5354.7, with the materials sector leading the
decline after commodities prices fell and iron ore hit a fresh five-year low. "A two day break at the
weekend has done little to dent the ambition of local sellers," says Tom Piotrowski, market analyst at
Commonwealth Securities. BHP Billiton (BHP.AU) is down 2% and Rio Tinto (RIO.AU) down 2.6%, while
smaller iron-ore producers have been harder hit, with Fortescue (FMG.AU) 6.1% weaker and BC Iron
(BCI.AU) off 6.7%. The four biggest banks are between 2% and 2.7% lower. Laboratory services
business ALS (ALQ.AU) is 16% lower after it warned its first-half profit could fall by about 36%. Arrium
(ARI.AU) is bucking the trend as it recovers from last week's sharp fall, gaining 5.3%.
