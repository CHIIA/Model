MOSCOW, Jun 27 (PRIME) -- Australia’s Norton Gold Fields, which is a subsidiary of Chinese mining
corporation Zijin Mining Group, has further increased its stake in Australia’s Bullabulling Gold Ltd to
19.8% from 17% for a week by purchasing shares on the market, Bullabulling said Friday.

Previously, the board of directors of Bullabulling had recommended its shareholders to reject Norton’s
off-market offer to acquire all the company’s shares for 8 Australian cents per share, and named it
inadequate and opportunistic.

Norton said that the rejection advice reflects the valuation range of 11.1-16.1 cents a share provided in
the independent expert’s report. “We believe this valuation was reached using a methodology that is
flawed, principally because it relies upon comparable transaction multiples from 2012 and early 2013, a
period in which the market for gold equities was significantly stronger than it is today”, the company said
adding that the independent expert in fact noted a valuation range of 7.0 cents to 8.7 cents, incorporating
a control premium of 40% to 45%, under the quoted market price methodology.

If the offer closes without Norton having succeeded in taking over Bullabulling, the Bullabulling share
price will, in all likelihood fall back to where it was trading at prior to April 17 when the offer was
announced, around 3.5 to 4 cents (as compared to 7.2 cents now).

“If we have 30% of Bullabulling shares, we will look at the project and have a solid plan to move it
forward… Bullabulling is only a 1 hour drive from our existing operations, which would offer some
operational management synergies and sharing of resources”, Norton also said.
Bullabulling Gold’s major asset is a project with the same name in Western Australia with JORC
resources of 3.753 million ounces of gold. It has a capital expenditure requirement of more than 300
million Australian dollars to bring it to production.
Norton Gold Fields is one of Australia’s largest domestic gold producers, with annual production of more
than 170,000 ounces. The company has a mining and processing complex in Western Australia’s
world-class Kalgoorlie gold region, including a prospective tenement package surrounding the
Paddington mill.
