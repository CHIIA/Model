0008 GMT [Dow Jones] There are few details to judge AWE's (AWE.AU) latest acquisition on but the
company does have a positive recent track record in M&A, says UBS. The company says it is making
its first entry into China with a deal to buy 40% of an exploration block in the western part of the prolific
Bohai Bay Basin. Assuming the two wells are drilled to their budget, AWE will spend A$20.2 million on
both over fiscal 2015 and 2016. UBS says there's no mention of whether the first well is targeting oil or
gas and no guidance on the size of the prospect, so it's difficult to judge how material success could be.
Still, given the shallow water in the area and the close proximity to the coast and pipeline infrastructure,
the brokerage says any discovery could be quickly commercialized. It has a neutral recommendation on
AWE and A$2/share target. AWE is trading up 0.3% at A$1.735. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:
