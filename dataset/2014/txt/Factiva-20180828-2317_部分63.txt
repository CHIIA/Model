$42 MILLION

LAST YEAR: $40 MILLION (46)
AGE: 39. PROPERTY (HOTELS).

SYDNEY
Paul Fischmann has taken advantage of Sydney's booming property sector to offload some of his hotels
in the past year. His 8Hotels Group is a tribute to a mentor who owned the Table Eight fashion label and
lent Fischmann money to buy a site. He sold the 1888 Hotel in Pyrmont to a Hong Kong investor for
$33 million and another in Potts Point earlier this year. He wants his group to be more flexible but is still
building, including a hotel near Sydney Airport, and he is looking for sites. He started 8Hotels in 2004,
having previously owned a chain of backpacker hostels which he offloaded.
