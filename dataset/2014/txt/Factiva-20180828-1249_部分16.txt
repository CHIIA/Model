Wanda Commercial Properties, China's largest commercial developer, said Aug. 11 that it will form a
joint venture valued at HK$12.5 billion, or about A$1.7 billion, with its parent company to invest in real
property projects in Australia.

The companies will first pay out HK$2.1 billion to acquire a 55% stake in the 11,355-square-meter Jewel
project site, which is on Old Burleigh Road in Surfers Paradise in Queensland. With a planned gross floor
area of 146,000 square meters, the mixed-use project will comprise three towers. The Hong Kong-listed
unit of Wanda Group plans to shovel US$900 million into building a luxury hotel and serviced apartments
on the site.

The news marked the Beijing-based developer's first investment in Australia and came within only a week
of it beating more than 10 bidders to acquire a land parcel in Beverly Hills, Calif., where it plans to invest
US$1.2 billion to build a mixed-use project that could reportedly aid in China's entry into Hollywood's film
industry.
Also in early July, the property-and-entertainment conglomerate was reportedly looking to pay US$900
million for what would be Chicago's third-tallest building, at 89 stories.
The group's hunt for overseas assets included Spain as well. In March, it offered €260 million to buy a
25-story building in Madrid from Spanish bank Banco Santander SA.
Controlled by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, Wanda is among the most aggressive Chinese
deal-makers abroad, with a goal of becoming "a world leading company by 2015 and a truly iconic and
international Chinese brand," according to its website.
The group has made headlines not only in property investment but also in M&A in other sectors. In 2012,
it acquired the U.S.-based cinema chain AMC Theatres for US$2.6 billion and in 2013 bought the British
yacht builder Sunseeker International for US$500 million.

In its home market, Wang's Wanda empire includes 93 Wanda Plazas, 59 five-star hotels, 83 department
stores in major Chinese cities, 1,247 film screens and 89 karaoke outlets. The conglomerate claims that
its shopping malls rank second worldwide in terms of total lettable area of 17.04 million square meters.
The massive scale dwarfs its closest commercial-play peers, including SOHO China Ltd., which owns a
portfolio of 5.4 million square meters, and Shui On Land Ltd., which has 10.3 million square meters. The
China unit of Singapore's CapitaMalls Asia Ltd., one of the top players in the market, also falls short
compared to Wanda, with only 62 shopping malls.
Wanda had revenue of 18.66 billion Chinese yuan in 2013, while SOHO China and Shui On registered
revenue of 14.62 billion yuan and 9.83 billion yuan, respectively. For financial year 2014, Wanda aims to
fetch revenue of 18.3 billion yuan from Wanda Commercial and 31.75 billion yuan from its entertainment
subsidiary.
Yan Yuejin, a Shanghai-based property analyst with China R&D Institute, said it is a "natural step" for the
renowned developer to diversify its sources of income abroad. "Just like Greenland Holding Group and
other property behemoths, Wanda wants to take on new challenges in some new markets and diversify
risks," he said.

as Chinese travel more. It is also easier to manage compared to building shopping malls," Yan said.

Chairman Wang Jianlin indeed has his own plans. The veteran who served in the army for 16 years now
makes his battlefield decisions in the boardroom.

By 2020, Wanda will have built 15 five-star hotels in eight to 10 global gateway cities, Wang said in a July
17 meeting. For the second half of this year, the group will complete one-third of that target, Wang said,
adding that Wanda is also in talks to acquire two large-scale entertainment enterprises overseas.
Elaborating on the drive to develop hotels abroad, the billionaire said, "It is not simply because Chinese
tourists can enjoy Chinese food and have easier communication, more importantly, our aim is to break the
western companies' monopoly on the high-end hotel."
"China is able to make satellites and nuclear bombs, but cannot export a world's leading luxury hotel
brand, this is abnormal," he added.
As of Aug. 13, US$1 was equivalent to 6.16 Chinese yuan.
