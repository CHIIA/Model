Approximately USD11 billion of debt securities affected

TD

Moody's Investors Service has today upgraded Fortescue Metals Group Limited's corporate family rating
(CFR) to Ba1 from Ba2. At the same time Moody's has upgraded FMG Resources (August 2006) Pty Ltd's
senior unsecured notes ratings to Ba2 from Ba3. The senior secured rating of Baa3 is not affected by
today's rating action and is affirmed. The outlook on all ratings is stable.

The upgrade follows today's announcement that Fortescue has issued two voluntary redemption notices
in relation to the outstanding notes of USD1.04 billion due 2015 and USD600 million due 2016.

RATINGS RATIONALE

"The one-notch upgrade in the CFR to Ba1 reflects our expectation for continued strengthening in
Fortescue's credit profile following the progress made on the company's debt reduction strategy and the
near completion of its substantial expansion program", says Matthew Moore -- a Moody's Vice President
and Senior Analyst. "The announced notes redemption and reduction in finance leases - following the
decision to assume ownership of Christmas Creek ore processing facility - further demonstrates the
company's commitment to its debt reduction strategy, which we previously highlighted as a factor that
would lead to improvements in the company's ratings", Moore adds.
Fortescue has reduced its adjusted debt by around USD3.1 billion through voluntary debt reduction
initiatives and we expect debt to reduce further as the company continues to work its gearing down to its
targeted level of around 40%. The company has announced that its debt reduction initiatives, combined
with the re-pricing of its term loan facilities, will reduce its annual interest expense by around USD300
million.

"The upgrade also reflects Fortescue's continued progress on its expansion activities, which are nearing
completion and will lead to further improvements in production and cash flow generation supporting
financial metrics in line with the Ba1 rating", adds Moore. Under our base case assumptions of iron ore
prices of around USD110 to USD120 (based on 62% Fe) for the second half of the fiscal year ending 30
June 2014, we now expect Fortescue's debt-to-EBITDA to improve to close to 2.0x.

"The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Fortescue will continue to generate solid cash flow and
achieve its production targets following the completion of the current expansion activities", says Moore.

The announced notes redemption is a further step in Fortescue's announced intention to reduce its debt
levels and improve its gearing levels towards its desired level of 40%. As of FY13, Fortescue's
debt-to-capital was around 68%, and under our base case we expect the ratio to decline to 50% to 55% in
FY14.

Fortescue is nearing completion of its massive expansion plans, which has led to a step change in the
company's production profile and revenue generation ability. Upon completion, production will increase to
around 155mtpa, almost triple the levels achieved in FY12. This drives substantial improvements in the
cash flow generation ability and unit costs of production for the company. We expect full year production
for FY14 to be around 125mt, resulting from the completion and ramp up of the Firetail mine at the
Solomon Hub in the June 2013 quarter and the expected completion of the Kings mine in early calendar
2014.

first major maturity now in FY17 when USD1billion of senior unsecured notes comes due.

The affirmation of the Baa3 rating on the senior secured term loan facility reflects the reduction of debt in
the capital structure ranking below the senior secured.

The ratings are not expected to be upgraded in the near term, however, the ratings could face positive
pressure if Fortescue demonstrates a track record of 1) consistently producing at the full expanded
155mtpa capacity and 2) maintaining a conservative financial profile such that Debt-to-EBITDA is
maintained below 2.0x through the cycle. In addition, a critical issue for a rating upgrade will be the
company's growth intentions post completion of the current phase of expansion. Achieving a more
geographically diversified customer base would also be supportive of a rating upgrade.
The outlook or rating could face negative pressure if the company experiences any unexpected
execution challenges with the remaining expansion activities, is unable to sustain production levels near
the 155mtpa target, embarks on any material further expansions, and/or adapts more aggressive
shareholder-friendly initiatives, such that credit metrics do not remain in line with Moody's expectations.
Iron ore prices sustained materially below our base case assumptions could also lead to negative
pressure on the rating or outlook. Financial metrics that Moody's would consider for a downgrade include
Debt-to-EBITDA exceeding 2.5x and FFO-to-Interest falling below 4.0x on a consistent basis
The principal methodology used in this rating was the Global Mining Industry published in May 2009.
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
Fortescue Metals Group Limited based in Perth, is an iron ore producer engaged in the exploration and
mining of iron ore for export, mainly to China. Fortescue is Australia's third largest iron ore producer
and exporter as well as one of the world's largest producers and sea-borne traders. Fortescue has around
15.6 billion tonnes of iron ore Resources, including 2.2 billion tonnes of reserves, and its tenement
holdings span an area of over 85,000 square km in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. For the
September 2013 quarter, Fortescue achieved and annual run rate of around 104mtpa of production.
Moody's expects full year shipments for FY2014 to be around 125mt.
