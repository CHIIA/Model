*US Fed chief Janet Yellen said last night there will be no early interest rate rise and also assured that the

*China's premier assures there won't be any hard landing
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday (UK time) that China's economy would not suffer a hard
landing and would continue to grow at a medium to high pace in the long term without strong stimulus. Li
made the comments during a speech in London's financial district on the final day of a visit which has
yielded trade and investment deals worth 14 billion pounds ($23.76 billion) and strengthened Britain's bid
to become the dominant centre for the Western trade in offshore yuan.
Li said he expected China's economy, the world's second-largest behind the United States, to grow at a
minimum clip of 7.5 percent, confounding critics, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who say
the country's rapid growth may eventually falter.
"There have been some discussions saying that the Chinese economy is slowing down, they are worried
whether the Chinese economy will head to a hard landing. Here I will be very frank and I will also make
this point very solemnly: this will not happen," Li said through a translator, Reuters reported.

*Reuters Tankan survey in Japan that Reuters said correlates closely with the official Tankan survey, was

face of soft exports and weakening consumption.

The rise includes position protection as the June SPI Futures closed off today, a short squeeze as the
market began to climb through trigger points and good news from overseas.

"Maree" said, "We are swinging either side of an up or down day and we are probably going to gain about
30 points today, following on from the US and Europe, although there are a lot of issues in our region.

"The US want a weak currency that enables them to be competitive on the global market. The US
economy isn't growing as fast as earlier expected and a weaker $US assists exports.

"The $A got another kick up last night. It is grinding higher, to the detriment of our terms of trade but it does
help to keep inflation subdued at this point in time.

"The $A will gain as one of the best three of a bad bunch - the British pound, where the UK has a runaway
housing market, the Kiwi, with an improving New Zealand economy and the Aussie - will continue to attract
funds from the likes of Japan and Europe".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 18 points to 5382.7 last evening.

NEWS OF THE DAY

World Heritage decides to put on "hold" danger to reef/progress being made

Reuters reports the United Nations on Wednesday said Australia was making progress to preserve the
Great Barrier Reef, a key tourist attraction that environmentalists say faces threats from industrial and
agricultural development.

The World Heritage Committee of U.N. agency UNESCO, meeting in Doha this week, deferred until 2015 a
decision on whether to place the 300,000-sq-km reef on its list of sites in danger.

"We welcome Australia's progress in managing the reef," panel director Kishore Rao said in a statement.
"UNESCO is confident the overall direction towards next year's decision is a positive one."
Some estimates say contamination from agricultural and mining industries operating near the coastline
has destroyed half of the reef's coral cover, but this figure is disputed.

"The committee has put Australia firmly on notice to take stronger action to protect the Great Barrier Reef,"
said Richard Leck, a spokesman for the World Wildlife Fund.

The reef has the world's largest collection of coral reefs, with 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish,
4,000 types of mollusc, and is home to threatened species, including the dugong and large green turtle,
according to the World Heritage list.

Page260of295©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation is concerned over proposed coastal
developments, including the building of ports and natural gas facilities.

It has asked Australia to submit an updated report on the state of conservation of the reef, which sprawls
over an area half the size of Texas, by next February 1.

*AIO: U/lying 2014 NPAT held but 500 jobs to go, pre tax costs now $120/130m Asciano Ltd in its
presentation to investors today included guidance for 2014 underlying NPAT of low single digit growth has
been maintained; the acceleration of two new business improvement programs will result in a reduction in
headcount of approximately 500 people and is driving a revised cost reduction target in the order of $90
million in 2015; material items pre tax for 2014 are now expected to be in t he range of $120/130 million
in costs vs the previous forecast $15/25 million in costs. The increase in the range primarily relates to the
costs associated with the integration of the Pacific National rail divisions and the costs associated with the
restructure of corporate and shared services.
Material items in 2014 will include non cash charges of approximately $75 million associated with the
rationalisation of the Pacific National rolling stock fleet following the integration of the two rail divisions and
asset writedowns associated with the Port Botany redevelopment. The majority of the cash costs in
material items will be incurred in 2014. The company expects to be free cash flow neutral in 2nd half
2014, with free cash flow after capital expenditure forecast to grow significantly over the next two years as
the capital expenditure refresh program is completed.

The business improvement initiatives are expected to drive growth in 2015 EBIT at a higher rate than
achieved in 2014 despite the expectation of relatively low volume growth across the business.

million in savings by full year 2016.
