The Papua New Guinea LNG project, which started up ahead of schedule in April this year, has been
operating at full capacity since late July, part holder Australia's Santos said Friday.

The project comprises two production trains, the second of which started up in May, located at a site
near the PNG capital of Port Moresby. The project cost US$19 billion to develop and has a total
capacity of 6.9 million mt/year.
Santos holds a 13.5% stake in PNG LNG, which is operated and owned 33.2% by ExxonMobil . The
other joint venture partners are PNG-based Oil Search (29%), the National Petroleum Company of PNG
(16.6%), Japan's JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (4.7%), local landowner company MRDC (2.8%) and
state-owned Petromin PNG Holdings (0.2%).

Around 95% of the project's LNG capacity is covered by long-term contracts, set to begin later in 2014.
The project's term customers are China's Sinopec, Japan's Tepco and Osaka Gas , and Taiwan-based
CPC.

The joint venture partners are eyeing the potential to add a third LNG production train at their liquefaction
facilities. The partners are looking to expand the reserves base in the project's Hides field and are also
planning to develop the nearby P'nyang gas resource.
The first output from PNG LNG contributed to Santos' first-half production of 25 million barrels of oil
equivalent, up 2% from 24.5 million boe a year ago. The company's guidance for the full year remains
unchanged at between 52 million boe and 57 million boe.
Santos Friday reported a net profit of A$206 million (US$192 million) for the half year ended June 30,
2014, down 24% from A$271 million in the corresponding period of 2013. Underlying net profit rose 3%
to A$258 million, from A$251 million previously, on a 25% increase in sales revenue to a record A$1.9
billion.
The rise in revenue was driven by increased crude oil and LNG sales volumes and higher oil and gas
prices, offset by a previously announced non-cash impairment of the company's Indonesian coalseam
gas assets, and higher cost of sales, exploration expense and net finance costs, Santos said.
Santos' 7.8 million mt/year coalseam gas-based Gladstone LNG project is now more than 85%
complete and on track to start up in 2015, the company said. GLNG is currently within its budgeted
capital cost of US$18.5 billion from final investment decision to the end of 2015, when the second train
is expected to be ready for startup, Santos added.
