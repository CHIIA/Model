$5.93 billion invested in the 2013 financial year
STATISTICS from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board show China has become our No.1
source of international buyers, with $5.93 billion invested in residential and commercial real estate
in the 2013 financial year. This includes:

– Money invested by Chinese developers on new developments
– Homes purchased by Chinese families moving here via the normal immigration process or with the
help of the Significant Investor Visa Program
– Homes purchased by the families of Chinese university students studying here under a temporary
visa; and
– Purchases of newly built or off-the-plan properties for investment, which international purchasers
living overseas can buy relatively freely under FIRB rules
The $5.93 billion is up 42% on the $4.19 billion spent by Chinese buyers in FY12 145% on the $2.42
billion in FY10.
Clearly, the Chinese love Australian property right now for a number of reasons:

– Our economic resilience during the GFC put us in the spotlight on the world stage
– A long-term history of reliable growth in most property markets

– Political stability

– Our large resident Asian community
– Our world-class schools and universities (education is highly valued in Chinese culture)
– We’re in the same business time zone, enabling our new Chinese residents to easily commute; and
Back in China, investors are increasingly concerned about a perceived price bubble; an oversupply
of new apartments; and the future quality of their food and air supply due to mass industrialisation.
To prevent a bubble burst, the Chinese government restricted investment and this has led to many
newly wealthy middle-class Chinese buyers looking for opportunities in other countries like ours.

Add to this the relatively new Significant Investor Visa, which has been a major hit with wealthy
Chinese families who can invest $5 million in approved assets to gain expedited residency and
therefore the opportunity to invest in as much new or established real estate as they want.
