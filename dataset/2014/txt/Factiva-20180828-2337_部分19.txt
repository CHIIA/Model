Bega Cheese Ltd signed a supply and distribution agreement with one of China’s leading retail
groups, Chongqing General Trading Group, last Friday for Bega to supply CGTG with Bega-branded
UHT milk produced in Australia.
The agreement is expected to generate revenues of about $100 million over five years and is seen as
the basis for a broader commercial relationship in the future.

The Chongqing municipality in the south-west is one of the fastest growing regions in China. It has a
population of 32 million and GDP growth in 2013 of 12.3 per cent.
CGTG is the leading retail group in the region, with a 50 per cent retail market share across food and
general merchandise.

Bega executive chairman Barry Irvin, chief executive officer Aidan Coleman and marketing manager
Paul van Heerwaarden were in Chongqing for the signing.

‘‘We see this as a first step in developing a comprehensive UHT offering in the future,’’ Mr Coleman
said.
Bega has had a presence in the Chinese market for more than 14 years: the Bega brand has been
sold in China since 2000 and Bega Cheese through its wholly owned subsidiary Tatura Milk
Industries has been a major Australian exporter of high value milk powder, infant formula and cream
cheese to the Chinese market.
