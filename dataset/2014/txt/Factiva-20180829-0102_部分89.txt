A$10,000,000 in cash or shares (at the election of Cape Lambert) on achievement of two key milestones
relating to the Sapes Project (A$5,000,000 for each milestone), namely the granting of an operating permit
and the sale of the first 1,000 ounces of gold or gold equivalent (Milestone Payments).
During the quarter, Cape Lambert received A$12,747,500 in cash which represents the sale of the
Company’s shareholding in Glory, and is based on 36,750,000 shares at $0.17 per share, as well as
A$6,500,000 for upfront payment in lieu of Milestone Payments.

FE Limited
FE Limited (ASX: FEL) (FE Limited) is an Australian based mineral resources company which holds
interests in a large portfolio of mineral resource projects prospective for iron, gold and nickel in Western
Australia and Queensland. In June 2011, FE Limited entered into a loan agreement with Cape Lambert
(Loan Agreement A) pursuant to which Cape Lambert agreed to lend FE Limited A$2,000,000, with interest
accruing at the cash rate plus 3% per annum.

In December 2012, FE Limited entered into a second loan agreement with Cape Lambert (Loan Agreement

lodged by the Company. Under this Arrangement, a total of approximately A$33.4 million has been paid
to the ATO by the Company.

The Arrangement provided that collection action for the balance of the disputed amount would not be
commenced by the ATO before the dispute is resolved. During the quarter, the Company was notified that
the objections lodged with the ATO in relation to the Amended Assessment were disallowed. The

Page268of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Company intends to appeal the objection decisions in the Federal Court of Australia. The appeal process
could take some time. Before an outcome on this appeal is known the Company should not be subject to
recovery action of the disputed amount.

MCC Legal Action
The dispute against MCC Australia Sanjin Mining Pty Ltd (MCC Sanjin), and its parent
companyMetallurgical Corporation of China Limited (collectively MCC) to recover the final A$80 million
payment from the sale of the Cape Lambert magnetite project in mid-2008 pursuant to an agreement
between the parties (MCC Agreement), as reported in detail in previous Quarterly Reports, is ongoing with
no developments during the quarter.

PROJECTS

Marampa (100% interest)
Marampa is an iron ore project at development and permitting stage, and is located 90 km northeast of
Freetown, Sierra Leone, West Africa (Marampa or Marampa Project). Marampa comprises two granted
exploration licences (EL46A/2011 - 239.18 km2 and EL46B/2011 - 66.00 km2 (formerly EL46/2011 -
305.18 km2)) held by Marampa Iron Ore (SL) Limited, which is indirectly, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Cape Lambert.
1Marampa has a total JORC Mineral Resource of 681 million tonnes (‘Mt’) at 28.2% Fe (above a cut-off
grade of 15% Fe) covering four deposits (Gafal, Matukia, Mafuri and Rotret).

Exploration

No exploration activities occurred during the quarter.

Topographic Surveying

Topographic surveying over the proposed tailings storage facility continued throughout the quarter and
remains ongoing.
Mining Licence
Marampa finalised and lodged its Large Scale Mining Licence application during the quarter and expects
that the mining licence to be granted during 2014.

Dempsey Resources (100% interest)
Dempsey Resources holds the Kukuna Iron Ore Project located in Sierra Leone (Kukuna Project or
Kukuna).

The Project is located 120 km northeast of Freetown in the northwest of Sierra Leone and consists of one
exploration licence (EL22/2012) covering 68 km2. The licence is located 70 km due north of the Marampa
Project and the Pepel Infrastructure and comprises rocks that correlate with the Marampa Group
stratigraphy known to host specular hematite mineralization.

Exploration

No exploration activities occurred during the quarter.

Pinnacle (100% interest)
Pinnacle holds the Sandenia Iron Ore Project (Sandenia Project or Sandenia) located 290 km east of
Conakry in the central south of the Republic of Guinea. The Project is comprised of a single tenement
covering approximately 298 km2. The Sandenia permit contains Banded Iron Formation (BIF) prospective
for iron mineralization, similar to that hosting the 6.16 Bt Kalia deposit owned by Bellzone Mining plc
located on the contiguous permit to the north.

Exploration
Field mapping and sampling to investigate potential hosts for gold mineralization alongside iron
mineralization continued throughout the quarter as weather permitted.

Metal Exploration Limited (100% interest)

Metal Exploration (Mauritius) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Lambert, holds 17 granted
exploration licences and one application in Sierra Leone covering approximately 2,386 km2. This land

Page269of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.package covers the region 70 km to the north and south of Marampa and is referred to as the Rokel Iron
Ore Project (Rokel or Rokel Project). Rocks from the Marampa Group (‘Rokotolon Formation’) exist
throughout the licence areas, much the same as the Marampa Project, and are known to host specularite
schist bearing units.

The Rokel Project is prospective for discovery of hematite schist deposits geologically similar to those at
Marampa and is located proximal to the existing Pepel Infrastructure. Regional mapping and geophysics
has identified a number of prospective areas which are progressively being followed up with targeted
exploration.

Exploration

Exploration focused on mapping to identify strike extensions of the Kumrabai prospect (Marampa East) in
the tenements south of the Marampa East licence.

Numerous outcrops and float of hematite schist have been observed and mapped. Additional mapping was
carried out along the western edge of the Magbosi licence where a magnetite bearing gneiss was identified
towards the end of the previous quarter. The magnetite rich gneissic unit is part of the Kasila Group, and is
geologically similar to that reported by West African Iron Ore Corporation in Guinea north of Kambia,
where an Exploration Target size between 2.9 Bt and 5.1 Bt was reported by SRK Consulting (Australasia)
Pty Ltd in March 2011.

Sampling

Assay results for 31 rock chip samples taken as part of the greater mapping campaign were received
during the quarter. Significant results include:

Hematite Schist

GHGR101: 59.6% Fe

GHGR103: 57.4% Fe

MWGR108: 50.4% Fe

MWGR115: 57.9% Fe

Magnetite Gneiss

MBGR002: 45.6% Fe

MBGR003: 43.8% Fe

MBGR004: 42.2% Fe

Cote D’Ivoire (100% interest)

Metals Exploration Cote D’Ivoire SA Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Lambert Resources. The
Company holds three tenements in the highly prospective Birimian Gold Belt of Cote D’Ivoire. The
tenements are named Boundiali North (400km2), Katiola (400km2) and Bouake (400km2) for a total land
position of 1,200km2.

The tenements all contain, or are adjacent to, Birimian Greenstones and metasediments and have
significant structural characteristics known to host high tenor gold mineralization in the district. The
Birimian Group is broadly divided into phyllites, tuffs and greywackes of the Lower Birimian (Type 2
metasediments), and various basaltic to andesitic lavas and volcanoclastics of the Upper Birimian (Type 1
Greenstone metavolcanics). Spatial distribution of gold mineralization appears to be governed by north to
northeast trending belts of metavolcanic rocks, ranging from 15km to 40km in width, associated with the
Upper Birimian.
The Birimain Gold Belt is host to numerous multi-million ounce gold deposits including the Morila (7Moz),
Syama (7Moz) and Tongon (4Moz) deposits. Almost without exception, these major gold deposits are
located at or close to the margins of the metavolcanic belts, adjacent to the strongly deformed contacts
between the Upper and Lower Birimian sequences as seen to exist within the recently granted tenements.
All three tenements are highly prospective and have the potential to host multi-million ounce gold
deposits.

Exploration

Page270of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Approval was recieved during the quarter to proceed with an airborne geophysical survey over the three
project areas. The survey will comprise aeromagnetic, radiometric and topographic data collection,
processing and analysis. The program Contract has been awarded to SRK Consulting (Perth) who will
oversee the data acquisition phase, data processing and interpretation.
The survey is anticipated to commence during Q2 with the data acquisition phase followed by the data
processing and interpretation phases with final reporting expected by the end of Q3.

No exploration activities occurred during the quarter.

Mt Anketell Pty Ltd (100% interest)

Mt Anketell Pty Ltd (Mt Anketell), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Lambert, holds a single exploration
licence (E47/1493) covering 56.9 km2 in the northern Pilbara region of Western Australia, which is
prospective for niche iron and gold mineralization associated with the Nickol River precinct. Mt Anketell
recently received a two year extension of the licence term.
Based on significant geochemical gold results identified on surrounding tenements and projected strike
extensions of the source lithology into the Mt Anketell ground, a proposal was submitted to the Department
of Mines and Petroleum to conduct auger geochemical sampling over the Nickol River prospect. Ministerial
consent was granted and a letter of POW approval was received in late December 2013. Work is now
progressing in the form of preparations for the proposed field work, which is expected to be conducted
during Q2 2014.
