DAIRY isn’t the only Australian agricultural industry China’s Bright Food Group has in its sights.
The state-owned business is reportedly planning to spend half of its more than $4 billion annual
revenue on international acquisitions, specifically looking more at vertical integration opportunities in
Australia.

Bright Food bought West Australian cheese and yoghurt producer Mundella this year and 75 per cent
of Manassen Foods in 2011.
Bright Dairy, which comes under parent companyBright Food, will take delivery of about a quarter of
the Pactum Dairy Group’s UHT from Shepparton under a $40 million agreement announced in
April.Bright also owns Mildura Fruit Company, Australia’s biggest orange exporter.
