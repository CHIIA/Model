Moody's Investors Service says that delinquencies in excess of 30 days in the Australian prime residential
mortgage market measured 1.31% in November 2013, up marginally from 1.29% in October and 1.28% in
November 2012.

Meanwhile, prime 60-day-plus arrears in November were 0.74%, compare favorably to most markets
covered in the report.

Prime 90-day-plus arrears in November were 0.51%, the same as October, but down from 0.54% in
November 2012.

"Looking ahead, we expect the performance trends for the Australian market in 2014 to continue those
seen in 2013, with losses remaining low, even though delinquencies will rise incrementally," says Noirit
Zaman, a Moody's Associate Analyst.

"This view is underpinned by our expectation for modest Australian GDP growth of 2% to 3%, as well as
the continuation of the current low interest rate environment and broadly stable unemployment rates of 5%
to 6%," adds Zaman.

Zaman was speaking on Moody's just-released report, titled "Global Structured Finance Collateral
Performance Review."
