IN 32 years the McGrath Group has grown from a one-man shop to a company that hit $10.1 bn in
residential sales at June 2014.
In 2013 the company launched its China Desk and November sales figures hit $1.163, an all-time
high.

In 2007, McGrath joined Apple to develop a real estate podcast, an Australian first.

And of course its chief was also the founding judge of The Block.

But none of this gets owner John McGrath out of bed in the mornings.

What motivates him are people, typified by a tiny ad in a Central Coast paper from a grateful
80-year-old client who congratulated the team on their help with her property sale.
"Real estate is not much about land and easements but it does have a lot to do with people," Mr
McGrath told 90 business guests and clients at last week's breakfast to launch the new office at
Rouse Hill Town Centre.

"Every time we open a new office - there are now 61 across the eastern seaboard - I feel the same
rush of fear and excitement," he said.
The Group chose the Rouse Hill site because it was an area "whose time has come".

"This is not just a franchise, this is a partnership with the community," he said.
Mr McGrath also spoke of the future of real estate — a very positive one in his view — discounting the
reported "bubble".

"The recent pace of growth is not sustainable but I still predict a 5-10 per cent growth in Sydney, with
south-east Queensland being the real mover over the next 3-5 years."
Mr McGrath also outlined four main themes driving real estate's future: the continued growth of the
China market, the importance of first-time buyers and investors, the emergence of the prestige market
and the creation of urban hubs as infrastructure unlocks pockets of Sydney, all covered in more detail
in the just-released McGrath Report 2014.
