House prices in China rose at a slower rate in May, figures from Reuters based on a National Bureau of
Statistics report showed on Wednesday.
New house prices in the major cities of China increased 5.6 percent year-over-year in May compared with
a 6.7 percent rise in April.

The growth in house prices has been slow since late 2013 due to the effect of a sustained campaign to
keep a check on speculative investment and easy credit, the bureau said.
The slower rate of growth in the housing market, accounting for 20 percent of China's GDP, dragged the
first quarter GDP to 7.4 percent year-over-year.

The Woodside share volume was the highlight of a morning with the market basically on "hold". Asian
markets were also quiet ahead of the FOMC minutes due out in the US tonight (our time). Tapering is still
expected despite the higher than expected US CPI number, the speculation is how much it will be shaved.

"May get back what it lost yesterday, up about 10"

"Maree" said, "With the RBA likely to keep rates low for a long time, there may be incentive for investors to
get back into stocks. I expect the market may get back what it lost yesterday, up about 10 points on the
day. But there is no real momentum driving the market either way.

"The $A came under a little bit of pressure after the RBA minutes on a bit of unwinding while investors
flocked into the kiwi instead - which has gained about 3c vs the $A over the last week.

continues, we will continue to attract overseas funds until such time as our economy is perceived to have
weakened further".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 11.6 points to 5400.7 last evening.

Australia Leading Index Shows Mild Improvement - Westpac

An Australian leading index continued to remain negative in May, although it improved slightly, results of a
survey by Westpac and Melbourne Institute revealed Wednesday.

The Westpac Melbourne Institute Leading Index gained 0.75 percent to a score of 98.08 in May from
98.01 in April. The index remained below trend for the fourth consecutive month with a score below 100.

The slight improvement was due to the combined effect of a strong increase of 1.68 percent in hours
worked and a 0.59 percent rise in U.S. industrial production.

Among the other sub-indices the expectations index rose 1.64 percent and the unemployment
expectations index fell 1.14 percent. However, commodity prices fell 1.01 percent, dwelling approvals
decreased 5.57 percent and yield spread declined 0.26 percentage points.

"The minutes to the June Board meeting repeated the line that the 'current accommodative stance of
policy was likely to be appropriate for some time yet' but struck a less confident tone, placing more
emphasis on the uncertainty of the transition from mining to non-mining led growth," said Westpac senior
economist Matthew Hassan
