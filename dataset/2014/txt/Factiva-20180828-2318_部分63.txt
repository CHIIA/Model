EQUITIES The Australian sharemarket closed more than half a per cent stronger yesterday, as the
financial sector pushed the market higher and with quarterly reporting season getting investors off the
sidelines.

At the close, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was up 46.8 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 5459, while
the broader All Ordinaries index had gained 42.6 points, or 0.79 per cent, to 5441.9.

Macquarie Equities division director Lucinda Chan said the market was led by the financial sector, with
three of the big four major banks set to report their latest profit results in the next week.

“But the commodities sector has been doing it tough; they’re under a lot of macroeconomic pressures,”
Ms Chan said.

“Materials prices have been softer, and the dollar has sprung back up to US88c, which will slow exports
down. Data out of China has been mixed, but it isn’t the only export market. The US is tracking well and
could pick up some of the slack in our resources exports.
“The focus over the coming week will be on company earnings, and the growing activity in the mergers
and acquisitions sphere. And with the banks in reporting season, investors are buying discounted
financial stocks early.” The dollar bounced back above US88c thanks to a weaker greenback. At the
close yesterday, the currency was trading at US88.16c, up from US87.65c on Friday Bendigo and
Adelaide Bank held its annual general meeting, at which it told shareholders of challenging market
conditions where spending was subdued, interest rates were low and people were paying down debt to
improve their financial position instead of borrowing. Shares in the bank rose 0.75 per cent to $12.15.

Vocus Communications has set its sights on rival Amcom Telecommunications, with a future tie-up
potentially creating a $1 billion telco. Shares rallied on the news, with Vocus stocks adding 2.45 per
cent to $5.44, while Amcom soared 12.37 per cent to $2.09.
Aurizon Holdings shares lifted 0.22 per cent to $44.58 after it reaffirmed its full-year coal and iron ore
volume guidance, despite a mixed performance in the September quarter.

Financials added 1.20 per cent as a sector.

ANZ lifted 0.98 per cent to $33.345, while Commonwealth Bank rallied 1.59 per cent to $80.02. National
Australia Bank added 0.76 per cent to $34.53, while Westpac added 1.02 per cent to $34.56.

Health care stocks lifted 1.01 per cent as a sector.
CSL added 0.82 per cent to $76.28, after announcing the acquisition of Novartis’s global influenza
vaccine business for $US275 million ($312.5m). Consumer discretionaries rallied 0.76 per cent as a
sector.

Myer lifted 1.4 per cent to $1.815, while Premier Investments slipped 0.1 per cent to $10.08.
