Implications of currency flight for the emerging economies

Handelsblatt (Google translation)

In the worst case, the World Bank estimated inflows into the emerging markets could fall by 80% within a
few months, although this is not the most likely scenario, Handelsblatt reported.

Handelsblatt added, the focus of the world economy has shifted.
Earlier Europe and the US were in sharp decline and emerging economies such as Turkey, China and
Brazil were booming.

To stop the economic decline monetary authorities of developed countries took unprecedented measures,
lowering interest rates beyond recognition and pumping staggering sums of money into the economy.
The Federal Reserve used more than three trillion dollars in the purchase of government bonds and real
estate securities.

"Investors accepted the invitation. They speculated with the cheap money" preferring countries where
risks and returns were high. Part of the money went directly into the emerging markets, where interest
rates were much higher.

An estimated $4 trillion flowed into emerging markets since 2009, Handelsblatt reported.

While the end of printing money is not yet in sight, the signal is clear: The Fed wants to say goodbye
gradually ultra-loose monetary policy. This in turn would result in rising interest rates. For investors, it
would be more attractive to reclaim their money from emerging markets.

How dangerous a sudden capital flight could be are clear from the Asian crisis in 1998 and the rouble
crisis of 1999.

However, "What we have not seen in emerging markets is a major currency devaluation, a run on
government bonds or rating downgrades," John Bilton, European investment strategist at Bank of
AmericaMerrill Lynch said. So long as that does not happen, funds in emerging markets are not losers.
