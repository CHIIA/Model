Mar 13: Xavier de Eizaguirre, Chairman and Guillaume Deglise, the newly appointed CEO of Vinexpo,
were in India last week on the traditional visit when they released the Study conducted by International
Wine & Spirit Research (IWSR), which is confusing and confounding as it claims Australia overtook
France in wine imports in a total market of only 1.2 million cases including 280,000 cases of imported
wines. Subhash Arora reports
Australia's share of wine sales in India increased by a whopping 72% to over 73,500 cases in 2012 from
48,800 cases four years ago in 2008, according to the Study which has been done globally for 28 wine
producing countries. The French wines are shown to have dwindled in their share to barely 60,000
cases.

Aussies might smirk while the French seethe with anger. Sale of 73,500 cases from Australia and only
60,000 from France!? Something seems to be amiss. Although the Aussie Jacobs Creek, the leading
single imported brand in India, considered to be the Johnny Walker Black Label by the novices, sold
between 30,000-35,000 cases (the study needs to elaborate) the next popular brands Yellow Tail and
Lindeman sell 4-5000 cases between them (estimates are based on interviews with Berkmann India and
Mohan Bros, importers of the two labels.

It seems highly unlikely that other Australian labels would make up the sale of balance 35,000
cases-unless the figures include import of bulk wines which have been a regular feature in the past and
delWine has often written about it in the past.

The figure of 60,000 cases for France appears to be low (with total estimated import of 280,000 in the
study, it implies about 21.5% share which according to most estimates hovered between 35-40% till
recently. While, I would like the French to comment about the figures, it is pertinent to keep in mind that
Moet Chandon alone sells between 25,000-30,000 (9-liter) cases of Champagne and has been
increasing its shares consistently- like Jacobs Creek. Between the two, they are the top two selling single
wine labels in India.

Curiously, at a similar briefing in 2010 which I attended in Delhi, the IWSR Study had then proclaimed
the sale of 1.709 million cases while the current study shows the reduced consumption at only 1.2
million cases! It had put the figure of red wine consumption at 72% for 2009 and further predicted that it
would rise to 78% in 2013. I had then commented 'until I see the full IWSR report and analyse reasons
for their optimism and seeing red, I would surmise- based on the figures collected from producers that
the reds are consumed between 60-62%, Rose at 3-5% and the balance 33-37 % are white wines.'
(Blog: Red, Red Wine). I could not lay my hands at the report but interestingly, the current study puts the
consumption of red wine at 61%!

One major assumption that the Study has not cared to clarify is whether it has considered the low- ended
fortified wined including the so called Goan 'Port' and other unfortified Ports (natural Ports where Sula is
the uncrowned king with an estimated sales of 200,000 cases this year. This 1.2 million+ case
sub-Rs.150 category is the biggest and fastest growing market segment and does not seem to find
mention in the study.

Study does have some interesting findings. It shows that the sales of Italian wines increased faster than
French wines- by 104% while the consumption of Chilean wines went up by about 76%. It claims an

to the calendar year whereas, traditionally, the figures released are for the financial year Apr-Mar)
Indian wine consumption is expected to grow by 73.5% increase expected in the next 4 years, according
to the Study. It predicts doubling of the sales of sparkling wine which is now a distinct possibility with the
introduction of Chandon by Moet Hennessey India and the consequent expansion of this segment and
more of the producers adding sparkling wine to their portfolio and the existing ones turning more
aggressive because of the Chandon arrival.

Vinexpo turning Spiritual
Talk to any wine importer in India and he would lament that it is becoming increasingly important to add
spirits to the wine portfolio for sustained growth. For the current edition in Hong Kong on May 27-29,
Vinexpo has gone 'spiritual' too. Deglise said that that a pavilion titled as 'Spiritual' was being dedicated
to liquor products at Hong Kong. This was for the first time that this new concept was being launched
outside the biennial event in Bordeaux. The move is apparently to focus on the Asia Pacific market which
he said, was now the single largest consumer of wine (3.4 billion bottles) and spirits.

The 'India Conference' at Four Seasons Hotel was attended by our Mumbai Correspondent Maloo
Natarajan who had a chat with Guillaume Deglise CEO of Vinexpo, He is quite bullish about the Chinese
markets but conceded that the Indian market didn't even fall in his radar as the consumption was so
small. On the question of Chinese buying vineyards in France, he clarified that Bordeaux was always
owned by other nationalities (even Rothschilds and Corinne Mentzelopoulos, owner of Chateau Margaux
are outsiders) and that it was not a concern for the French. The Conference sponsored by Sula whose
CEO Rajeev Samant also attended the activities for a while, had a relatively poor attendance of around a
dozen people since Vinexpo Hong Kong is not of as much interest to India as the Vinexpo (Bordeaux)
which is attended by most importers.
