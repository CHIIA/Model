SOLD FOR $7 MilLION A CHINESE buyer has paid $7.16 million for a large riverfront estate at
Carrara that has hosted pop stars, including Elton John and Rod Stewart.
The property, at 30-32 Maryland Ave, was sold by music industry veteran Graham Hutchison, who
has promoted tours for international artists including AC/DC, Bob Marley, Billy Idol and Nirvana.

It was bought by Prosper Holdings, of which 51-year-old Chinese-born Stanley Chan is the majority
shareholder.
The sale is the third highest for this year.
It follows 60 Admiralty Drive, Paradise Waters, which sold for $8.7 million, and 72-74 The Sovereign
Mile, The Sovereign Islands, which sold for $7.25 million.

Mr Hutchison bought the property in 2003 and it was on the market continuously for over six years
between August, 2008 and September this year before the showbiz promoter sold it last month.
The 8029sq m block contains a 929sq m two-level residence with a media room,
temperature-controlled wine room and undercover al fresco dining area complete with a barbecue
kitchen.

A floodlit championship tennis court is next to a pavilion with a gymnasium and a pampering room.

Other features include a pool, a 10m pontoon with a jetski cradle and 75m of river frontage.
In 2012 Mr Hutchison spent $1 million on renovations and was quoted in July this year in the Gold
Coast Bulletin stating his property had attracted five contracts from Chinese buyers.
“The Chinese love it because it’s huge – the two numbers (30 and 32) add up to eight ... you can land
a helicopter and keep two horses,” he said.

“It’s a very homely house and it’s so quiet, so peaceful and you’re away from everything.” He said he
was planning to move to the Sunshine Coast.Mr Hutchison runs the Hutchison Entertainment Group,
which has offices both in Australia and Russia due to his promotion of tours by Russian ballet groups.
