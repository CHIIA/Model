Moody's Investors Service says that the currently weak iron ore price will exert a direct negative impact
on its rated Australian producers over the next 6-12 months with second-order effects on a host of other
sectors.

"Lower prices -- combined with the general softness in prices across the whole commodities spectrum -- is
exercising a flow-on negative effect on several issuers and sectors across the rated portfolio, including
mining services, construction, and airlines," says Matthew Moore, a Moody's Vice President and Senior
Analyst.

Moore was speaking on the release of a Moody's special comment, titled "Impact on Australian
Corporates of Decline in Iron Ore Price".
The report notes that iron ore prices, currently around $84 per metric tonne (mt), are down considerably
from the average for the six months to 30 June 2014 of around $110 per mt, which is down from an
average of around $135 per mt in FY13. This is largely because of a significant rise in production capacity
in Australia and, to a lesser extent, Brazil, as well as slowing demand in the key export market of China.

"To preserve margins, we expect the miners to reduce their scope of work and renegotiate contracts with
the providers of mining services, which will in turn further reduce earnings and cash flows at the latter,"
says Moore.
Atlas Iron Limited's (B2 stable) credit profile will be the most affected, reflecting its position as a
single-commodity producer with moderate cash costs. Atlas will be further impacted by widening price
discounts for its iron ore, which is generally of lower quality than that from the major producers.
Of the major iron ore miners, Fortescue Metals Group (Ba1 stable) is the most affected as, unlike its
peers, it is a single-commodity producer.

By contrast, the earnings and credit metrics for BHP Billiton (A1 stable) and Rio Tinto (A3 stable), while
also experiencing pressure, are better positioned, given their lower cost profiles, improvements in debt
levels, and benefits from product diversity.

Moreover, as part of initiatives to counter the weak price environment, the majors have been reducing
their labor forces, meaning reductions in fly-in fly-out passengers. This trend is negatively impacting the
airlines and airports, such as Qantas Airways (Ba1 negative) and Perth Airport (Baa2 stable).

A potential further reduction in capital expenditures for development would negatively impact the
construction and engineering sectors, as companies, such as Leighton Holdings (Baa3 stable), face
reduced project work.
