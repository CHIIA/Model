INCREDIBLE RALLY PARTLY BOOSTED BY GOOD NEWS, MOSTLY TECHNICAL

Our market rose an astonishing 85 points, closing on its ultimate high of the day on huge volume worth
$6.4 billion - partly on good news, but mostly on technical triggers. The rise includes position protection
as the June SPI Futures closed off today, a short squeeze as the market began to climb through trigger
points and good news from overseas. Aussie 10 year bond yields were down 5 points to 3.64%. The $A
has risen 75 points to 94.14US c.

Leading banks and resources contributed the bulk of the gain, 28.5 and 20.8 positive points respectively,
while there were small gains across the board.

*TEN fell 2c to 27c on 14m shares after its guidance today.

*Perseus rose 5c to 36c on 11.1m shares on its report today.

*Nib Bnoldings fell 28c to $3.05 on 1.3m shares on lowering its guidance.

*Asciano rose 32c to $5.55 on 8.6m shares as the market reacted positively to its 500 job cut news.

Good news included:

*US Fed chief Janet Yellen both saying there will be no early interest rate rise and also assuring that the
economy is growing.
*China's Li Keqiang who said on Wednesday (UK time) in London that China's economy would continue
to grow at a minimum clip of 7.5%, there would be no hard landing

*And Reuters' tankan survey, that closely correlates with the official survey that found manufacturers
were more confident than expected.

*Meanwhile a leading broker forecast yesterday that at close of trade tomorrow Aquila's weight in the
S&P/ASX200 will decrease slightly, Kingsgate and Sirius weighting will increase slightly and Woodside's
weighting is expected to increase by a significant 0.265% to 2.275% in the S&P/ASX200.

*At 4pm AEST the NikkeiDow futures rose 190 points to 15,310 points, Shanghai CSI physical fell 16.97
points to 2038.55, Hang Seng futurers rose 61 points to 23,234 points, S&P futures rose 0.6 points to
