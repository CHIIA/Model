SYDNEY--Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AU) said it has signed a US$275 million deal with a
Chinese shipyard to build four large ships to transport iron ore from Australia to Asian buyers.
Perth-based Fortescue didn't name the Chinese company which will build the ships.

It said the deal would help reduce its freight costs and ensure it has a secure supply of vessels after
lifting its annual production capacity in Australia's remote Pilbara mining region to 155 million metric
tons from 55 million tons two years ago.
Mining companies are aggressively seeking to cut costs at a time when iron ore prices have tumbled
their lowest level since September 2012. Fortescue is striving to cut a multibillion-dollar debt pile
amassed during its transformation from a tiny explorer to the world's fourth-largest iron-ore miner in the
decade starting 2002.
The ships, which can carry up to 260,000 tons of iron ore, will be delivered to Fortescue between
November 2016 and May 2017. The purchase will be funded with operating cash flow.

According to Fortescue, they will account for about 6% of its shipping needs at the major Western
Australian iron-ore hub of Port Hedland.

"Owning and managing vessels especially designed to complement conditions at the port and to
maximize shipped volume is expected to reduce our costs," Fortescue Chief Executive Nev Power said
in the statement.
