Chinese-owned Norton Gold Fields – believed to be the frontrunner for Barrick’s Kanowna
operations – has bolstered its hedge book.

Norton on Tuesday confirmed an additional 25,000 ounces with Macquarie Bank over the next 12
months at a flat forward price of $1431/oz. The company still has 9700oz at $1601.40/oz remaining
in the initial hedging program it announced last August.

“Norton is pleased with the pricing that was achieved for this hedging facility,” chief executive Dianmin
Chen said.
“In light of the continued volatility of the gold price, adding a modest amount to our hedge program at
a recent high will secure our short-term revenue stream, while providing upside opportunities should
the gold price continue to rise.”

Last year, Norton achieved its highest annual production of 172,739oz since acquiring the Paddington
operations in 2007.

Norton’s total production costs were $1188/oz in the December quarter, slashed from $1784/oz in the
corresponding period in 2012.
Despite spending almost $2 million on capital expenditure in the quarter, including $900,000 for an
underground loader, Norton finished 2013 with $41 million cash in bank. It capped a year in which
many WA mid-tier gold producers became unprofitable, yet Norton bucked the trend by officially
opening its Enterprise mine which should provide the bulk of mill feed for the next decade.
The first ore was delivered to Norton’s Paddington mill, 35km north-west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, in
October and the company is building a haulage road through its tenements to further slash costs.
“Driving the improvement has been increased mill feed grades from across our operations along with
a strict cost control regime,” Dr Chen said.

Norton has also begun underground development at the Bullant mine, which was put on care and
maintenance two years ago by Kalgoorlie Mining Company.

Production should resume in early 2014. Meanwhile, there is still no indication when Canadian giant
Barrick will complete the sale of its Kanowna operations which have been on the market since at
least August.
Barrick chief executive Jamie Sokalsky told a Toronto mining conference in December the Kanowna
operations had received “quite a lot of interest”.

Workers were expecting a deal before Christmas and are growing anxious. The assets include the
Kanowna Belle mine, mill and roaster and the nearby East Kundana operation, comprising the
high-grade Raleigh and Rubicon-Hornet mines.

Mining Group, which holds an 81 per cent stake.
Barrick has already sold its Plutonic mine to Northern Star Resources for $25 million with that
transaction expected to settle next month.
