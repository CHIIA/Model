The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close a touch lower today.

Europe fell, the UK was flat, the US markets closed slightly lower.

On the NYSE where 3237 issues traded there were 1,285 issues higher, 1,827 down and 125 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2812 issues traded there were 864 issues higher, 1,838 down and 110 unchanged.
Metals were higher except for copper, iron ore fell, crude was down, gold was steady, uranium rose
sharply. The $A is at 92.76 US c, up about 20 points from last evening.

"Resistance at 5547, support at 5510 followed by 5500 .. down 5 points'
Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser with Morgans said, "Copper had a bit of a sell off last night, holding just
above critical support at $3.15/lb. A break of $3.15 will more than likely see it head back to $3 which would
be quite bearish for the short term uptrend it has been in since March.

"Crude is just above the key support level of $97 a barrel. A break of $97 more than likely will see it head
back down to $92/93 a barrel - the IEA commented that despite the tensions there has not been any
disruptions to supply.

"The Shanghai market ran into a bit of profit taking yesterday. It was sold down during the session but
closed back up near its support. There is a lot of buying momentum there. Resistance remains at 2227. It
certainly looks like a break to the upside is more than likely. Downside support is at 2105. It is a very
bullish picture on the Chinese market against other global indices.

"The German index has been grossly over sold over the last couple of weeks. I expect a bounce to 9600.
The key level of support remains 9000. It needs to hold for the week. The picture remains bearish there.

"The S&P 500 was strong on the opening and then faded. There seems to be continued selling pressure
there. Momentum is still on the downside. Technically it is threatening to continue its downtrend. The key
level of support will remain at the 100 day moving average of 1917. A break of that will see it back down to
1850.

"I was expecting a bit more of a bounce from German and US markets this week. It is certainly interesting
at this point on whether they resume their downtrend.

"For our market, it was an extremely strong day yesterday. The next level for the bulls is the 20 day
moving average which is sitting at 5547. The bulls will want to see our market close above that for this
week.

"The short term picture looks a lot better than the DAX and S&P. Support is at 5500. If we break that then
we will test 5450, the lows of earlier this week.

Page43of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Our SPI was up against the rest of the markets - there seems to be more buying support in our market at
present. There is better value in the resources and some selected industrials. I have been reducing
exposure to the big four and lifting exposure to some diversified resources especially BHP. I expect
resources to outperform for the rest of this week if metal prices hold.

"For today resistance is at 5547. Support is at 5510 followed by 5500.

"I can't call us up again after yesterday's rise. I will call us down 5 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 rose 73.3 points to close at 5530.3 last evening.

Trading points:

Reporting today:

*AMM: Amcom reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $23.02 mln.

On July 25 a leading broker retained an "add" on Amcom Telecom and a target price of $2.25. The broker
said it returns to an Add on the stock given it has fallen below fair value following its $40 million raising in
new equity in June. "We consider it is one of the more reliable earners in the small cap telco sector and
as a carrier with its own fibre asset, one relatively immune to the fluctuating fortunes of policy and
regulation.

*CBA: Commonwealth Bank of Australia reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $8.651.4 mln, div 217c, $8.745 bn cash earnings, div 220c/$8691.4 bln/$8.682
mln/consensus $8.639 bln, div 214c.

*On August 5 a leading broker said it expects another strong result, and expects ongoing improvement in
asset quality, 2nd hand BDD charge is expected at 14 bp. The broker added "The upcoming release of the
FSI (due in November) is the biggest issue facing the banks, in our view".

On August 1 a leading broker with a 'sell" on CBA and a price target of $81.58 said it believes CBA has
the most margin upside among majors from wholesale funding spread improvement and term deposit
spread normalisation. In particular, the broker expects CBA to benefit from a number of government
guaranteed facilities reaching maturity through full year 2014.

On the other hand, the broker's product pricing data suggests that CBA has been among the most
aggressive of the major banks on mortgage competition. It forecasts 1bp of margin contraction half on half
in 2nd half 2014 for CBA vs 2 bp contraction on average for majors ex CBA.

*On August 1 the Financial Times reported as of Aug 01, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 35 polled
investment analysts covering Commonwealth Bank of Australia advises investors to hold their position in
the company. This has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts improved

Page44of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.on Feb 28, 2013. The previous consensus forecast advised that the company would underperform
Commonwealth Bank of Australia. There were 2 buys, 4 outperforms, 12 holds, 7 underperforms and 3
sells.

*On July 24 Nomura had a "neutral" on Commonwealth Bank with a price target of $78.

*CPU: Computershare reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $US330 mln/$US332.3, div 15c/$US336mln, div 16c/$US331.

*On August 8 a leading broker had a "neutral" on Computershare with a price target of $13.70. The broker
said the company has guided for $US $ management eps to be up 5/10% on pcp. However most
estimates re at the upper end of this range. The broker expects 2nd half 2014 margin income to come in at
around $US93 million, down from $US106 million in first half 2014 and expects the company to guide
for 5/10% growth since the company tends to take a fairly cautious view.

The broker forecast US eps growth of 12% with consensus growth expectations roughly 11%.

*On August 6 a leading broker retained an "underweight" on Computershare while raising the price target
from $11 to $11.30.

The broker said ahead of the results, it raises five key points' a subdued outlook for the core registry
maintenance business that is about 40% of revenue, business services revenues expected to be broadly
flat year on year, its global service model should continue to provide savings, leverage to rising short end
rates is attractive given CPU's $US6 billion float, but there is risk interest rates do not rise fast enough to
meet consensus expectations next year. The broker forecast expanding EBITDA margins to 27.7%,
delivering eps growth of 8.2% vs guidance of 5/10%.

*On July 24 Nomura retained a "neutral" on Computershare with a $12.50 price target. The broker said
within the diversified financial sector, "Our preference is for CPU (Neutral) given its exposure to the
improving US economy.
Company guidance: On July 1 Computershare Ltd announced it expects to make net writedowns of
approximately $US40 million after tax as at end June 2014. The writedowns comes as the company
nears the end of its review of non core and non strategic assets. Outgoing CEO Stuart Crosby saId no
further writedowns are expected and more detail will be provided at the 2014 full year results release on
August 13.

Incoming CEO Stuart Irving reaffirmed that CPU's management eps for 2014 are expected to be up 5/10%
on the 2013 results.

*CRZ: Carsales reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $93.8 mln, div 17.2c/$94.2 mln, div 17.3c/$96.2 mln.

*On August 7 a leading broker reiterated its July 23 downgrade of Carsales to "Neutral" with a price target
of $10.95. The broker said it expects CRZ to provide an update on the auto manufacturers that had
withdrawn new car inventory as well as some advertising support late last year.. It forecast 13% growth in
dealer revenue driven by price rises in dealer enquiry fees ($5 per enquiry from Feb 1 2013), moderate
volume growth in leads reflecting some sensitivity to the subdued macro conditions and strong non auto
revenue gains.
Among other points, the broker also expects further detail on recent acquisitions - a 50.1% stake in
Stratton Finance and a 49.9% stake in SK Encar.

*On July 1 a leading broker had an "add" on Carsales with a $11.91 target price, up from $11.34. The
broker said Carsales.com has moved into a new part of the automotive value chain - vehicle finance -
through the purchase of a controlling 50.1% stake in Stratton Finance, the country's largest independent
vehicle finance broker. The deal will be immediately earnings accretive.. Carsales continues to use its
under geared balance sheet to add new earnings growth options. Vehicle finance now joins Brazil, South
Korea and South East Asia as potential new earnings drivers, the broker said in the report.

*CSL: CSL reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $US1.27 bln/$US1.299 bln/$US1.354 bln/$US1.357 bln, div 54.7c/$US1.354.7
bln/$US1.297 bln.

*On August 11 a leading broker with an "equal weight" on CSL had a price target of $60.35. The broker
said CSL's IG growth is facing tough competition as the mix-shift to higher priced product is nearly

Page45of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.complete, its lapping Octapharma-related share gains and the high growth in the pcp will be hard to meet.
The broker expects the same for 2014. CSL's specialty products are expected to continue robust double
digit growth, however the coagulation franchise is expected to show weakness even ahead of competitors
product launches. Full year 2015 growth could be more challenged, the broker added.

*On August 6 a leading broker retained a "buy" on CSL with a price target of $82.

The broker said IG revenue growth will be a major forecast. It expects investors to focus on the outlook for
CSL's subcutaneous IVIG product, Hizentra, given the recent favorable FDA committee vote for Baxter's
rival HyQvia product. It is also focused on global supply/demand dynamics for Ig, including recent new
entrants to the US market.

The broker forecast 11.6% EBIT growth for CSL Behring, limited medium term growth for CSL's FVIII
franchise and expects CSL will announce a buyback.

A leading broker on August 4 ahead of CSL's profit report on August 21 retains a "buy" on CSL with a
share price target of $80. The broker said despite a trifecta of events in the past 48 hours, it rates the net
impact as more negative for sentiment than forecasts. The broker expects CSL to meet or beat if 2014
guidance of 10% ccNPAT growth pre adjusted for legal settlement, with the capacity to guide to a further
1-/5 growth in 2015 plus a new buyback program.

The trifecta of events includes the FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee voting in favor of Baxter's
HyQvia product, supporting risk communication strategies but not restricted to labelling. Bayer 2nd quarter
2014 results highlight 17% Kogenate sales decline due to manufacturing restraints and Grifols Bioscience
division reported first half 2014 3.3% gain in CC, down 1% on the previous period, noting an increase in
sales of IVIG and albumin but moderate fall in intermediaries and pdf VIII sales with tender delays.

*A leading broker on the same date had an "accumulate" on CSL with a share price target of $74.48. The
broker said the underlying momentum of the company's plasma derived portfolio continues to be
supported by a range of factors. There is further upside potential in the specialty care portfolio and a
non-valent Gardasil release.

Decreased debt costs, the ongoing buyback, improving payout ratio, the announcement of a partnership
agreement and an insight into the treatment of Alzheimer's are all potential upside risks.

*The Financial Times reported as of Aug 01, 2014, the consensus forecast amongst 20 polled investment
analysts covering CSL Limited advises that the company will outperform the market. This has been the
consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts improved on Oct 01, 2013. The previous
consensus forecast advised investors to hold their position in CSL Limited. There were 4 buys, 6
outperforms, 6 holds and 2 sells.

*EGP: Echo Entertainment reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $151.8mn norm/$151.9 mln, div 4c/$151.8 MLN/consensus $152 mn, div 2c ff.

*On August 11 a leading broker had a "lighten" on Carsales with a price target of $2.64.

The broker said it expects Echo to report a 17% increase in management's normalised EBITDA to $432.2
million, a 5% increase in management's normalised net profit to $152.2 million and a 2c per share fully
franked final dividend.

The broker said Echo is currently outperforming in VIP relative to domestic and some international casinos
which are showing flat to negative growth and on the main floor, relative to pubs and clubs in NSW and
QLD.

"At the moment, we believe that Echo is benefitting from increased participation in the loyalty program,
greater non commission spend by customers along with a strong tailwind of slot spend in NSW and QLD.

The broker believes EGP is facing accelerating loss of market share in slots. There is also a worrying
negative mix associated with the decline in electronic gaming vs other lower margin products.

*On August 1 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on EGP with a price target of $3. The broker said with
EGP having provided a trading update and guidance for 2014 it is expecting few surprises in the headline
result. The broker added the big item for Echo is the development of its proposal for the Queen's Wharf
precinct in Brisbane with proposals due by the end of the year. However given the confidential nature of
the bidding process not much new news is expected.

Page46of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On July 24 one leading broker had a "buy" on Echo Entertainment with a $4.25 price target after the
announcement of the binding MOU with rival bidders Chow Tai Fook Enterprises and Far East Consortium
Pty Ltd to form a "Destination Brisbane Consortium" for an integrated casino resort proposal in Brisbane.

The broker said with signs of EGP earnings finally beginning to show some of the benefits from numerous
operational improvements and capex, the stock continues to trade at a discount to market.

*Another leading broker retained a $3.90 target price and said the announcement is not entirely
unexpected since the size and scope of the development would stretch echo's ability to finance the project
alone. The broker expects the final decision by the Queensland government in early full year 2015.
Company guidance: On June 16 Echo Entertainment Group Ltd advised in an update on trading and
guidance said based on the revenue momentum of the second half of the year to date, Echo expects to
report normalised 2014 EBITDA within the range of $430/435 million and normalised 2014 NPAT within
the range of $150/153 million. The expected result is above current median analyst forecasts and
reported Bloomberg consensus normalised EBITDA of $411 million on a like for like basis.

Actual EBITDA will be impacted by the win rate and turnover experienced in the VIP Rebate business for
the remainder of the financial year and therefore is subject to potential volatility.

A revenue update for the March quarter was provided on April 1. The underlying normalised revenue
trends experienced across the business in the March quarter continue to prevail.

Across the group normalised gross revenue grew 10.2% on the prior comparable period, of up 12.1% on
an actual basis.

For the domestic business excluding the VIP Rebate business revenue grew 9.3% on the prior
comparable period.
Echo now expects to deliver operating expenditure around $870 million for 2014.

*GFF: Goodman Fielder reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $59.8 mln, 1c unfr final div/$59 mln.

*On August 8 a leading broker had a 'sell" on Goodman Fielder with a 68c price target.

The broker said the result is largely irrelevant as the market focuses on the deal timeline "given the
lengthy process of recent deals, there is a high probability that MOFCOM approval takes significantly
longer than expected, reducing the PV of the deal to well below the 67.5c Scheme price" the broker said in
the report.

*On August 8 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on Goodman Fielder with a 63c price target.

The broker said GFF has entered into a Scheme Implementation Deed with Wilmar International Ltd and
First Pacific Company to acquire all of the shares in GFF for 67.5c cash per share. The scheme allows
GFF to pay a final dividend of 1c per share for 2014. GFF expects to hold the Scheme meeting on
November 3.
Company report: On July 2 Goodman Fielder Ltd announced following completion of due diligence by
Wilmar and First Pacific and negotiations on the proposed scheme, GFF has entered into a Scheme
Implementation Deed with Wilmar and First Pacific whereby Wilmar and First Pacific will require all of the
remaining issued equity in GFF they do not already own for 67.5Ac cash per share (down from 70c
offered earlier) subject to all conditions being satisfied. The scheme also allows GFF to pay a final 1c per
share dividend for 2014.

As previously announced, GFF expects to record a non cash impairment charge for 2014 in the range of
$A300/400 million.

GFF chairman Steve Gregg said in the report the board continued to unanimously recommend to
shareholders that they approve the scheme in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to the
independent expert concluding the Scheme is fair and reasonable.*NCK: Nick Scali reports for the year.
Company guidance: On June 26 Nick Scali Ltd advised in recent months order intake and sales revenue
have remained above the previous corresponding period. Likely full year sales revenue on both a total and
same store comparative basis are ahead of the previous year by around 10% and 5% respectively.
It is expected NPAT for 2013/14 will be around $14 million, up 15% on last year's underlying NPAT of
$12.2 million.

Page47of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*OZL: OZ Minerals reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: Neg $60.5 mln, 5c div/Neg $36.1 mln

*On July 16 following the June quarter production report a leading broker retained a "hold" but lifted its
price target to $4.40 from $4.20. The broker said OZL has upgraded 2014 copper production guidance
13% to 85/90Kt while gold production is now expected to be at the lower end of 130/140,000 ozs with
copper ore to be prioritised at the mill.
Cash at end of June was $155 million, down over $200 million from the $364 million at end December,
a larger drop than expected.

*On July 15 a leading broker with a 'sell" recommendation and a $3.60 price target said it maintains its sell
based on valuation. "In our view the company is mine life challenged with limited open pit mine life with
marginal underground post 2019. The broker added the cash balance had fallen more than expected.

*Another leading broker on July 15 retained an "add" and a $5.50 price target saying production and cost
beat expectations and guidance was upgraded. However the cash balance was lower than expected, hit
by working capital movements and a $A30 million dividend payment.

*PRY: Primary Healthcare reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $165m/$164.8 mln, div 11.1c/$165 mln/$150.1 mln/170.1 mln reported/$161 mln.

*On August 11 a leading broker retained an "overweight" on Primary Health Care with a price target of
$5.760, both unchanged since July. The broker said PRY's performance has been recently clouded by the
government's proposed GP co-payment. We see the associated downside to PRY as minimal for now, we
retain our OW and thesis'.

*On August 6 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on Primary Health Care with a price target of $4.85.

The broker expects 2nd half 2104 EBITDA to be up 7% driven by 6.5% revenue growth from mostly higher
volumes and modest margin expansion as centres mature and are back-filled. It expects investor focus to
be on the cashflow requirements of the business (i.e. GP churn and new medical centre openings) and on
potential changes to the government's proposal to introduce co-payments for GP visits. It notes that
Medical Centre revenue growth has lagged growth in doctor numbers for at least the past two years.

In pathology it forecasts profit growth (EBITDA up 7.5%) driven by 5% revenue growth and margin
expansion from operating leverage. It expects investor focus on potential fee cuts in 2015 and also on
potential co payments for pathology.

*On August 1 a leading broker retained a "hold" on Primary Health Care Ltd and a price target of $4.91.
The broker said the company's ability to backfill GP's into its MC (medical centres) business remains a
key driver of top line growth given the recent hiatus in greenfields developments.

*On July 28 another leading broker had an "add" on Primary Health Care with a $5.68 price target.

The broker said it sees continued evidence of improvement in operational metrics for Australia's largest
private medical centre operator and a major pathology provider, with GP productivity gains helping to
alleviate concerns surrounding GP acquisition costs and churn rates.
Company guidance: 7/13% eps growth, EBITDA $395/410 mln.

*SKC: SkyCity reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $NZ121.9 mln

On July 8 a leading broker lowered its rating from "buy" to "neutral" on Sky City Entertainment with a
$NZ4.15 target price.

The broker said it lowered its investment rating to reflect lower medium term earnings growth due to
disruption and delays with Adelaide and Auckland casino expansion projects coupled with a higher $NZ.
This could limit valuation upside over the next 12 months and create downside risk to consensus earnings.

*SKE: Skilled Group reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $51.7 mln

Page48of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*On August 4 a leading broker retained a "buy" on Skilled Group with a price target of $3.60. the broker
said it expects SKE to report stable EBITDA but lower NPAT, down 6% to $55.1 million due to higher
interest expense and higher D&A.
It expects net debt to increase to $149 million from $45 million last year and $133 million in the first half
with net debt/EBITDA at 1.5x. This reflects the impact of acquisitions (Broadsword Marine in July 2013 and
T&C Services in February 2014) and major capex (eg purchase of new vessels). The broker expects the
company to provide an update on the cost reduction strategy including targets for 2015.

*SUN: Suncorp reports for the year.

Analysts expectations: $1.291.3 bln, div 60c/$1.266 bln, headline Net Profit post amortisation and NRI's
$687 million/$809 mln. A final 39c div is expected.

*On August 13 a leading broker retained a "hold" on Suncorp but with a price target of $14.17, lifted from
$13.40 earlier.

The broker said it thinks there will be solid reported and underlying trends in general insurance in line with
IAG (pre-reported) and non listed peers, but there will be a continued focus on growth and margin outlook
from here. "We expect to see weak volumes in the bank offset by strong net interest margin (NIM)
expansion.

Life insurance writedowns have already been pre-announced.
The broker added, 'substantial progress on sale and rundown of the non core bank raises the probability
of significant capital management".

*On August 8 a leading broker had a price target of $14.30 on Suncorp without indicating a rating. The
broker said it expects the company to declare another special dividend, the broker expects 15c with risk
skewed to the upside.

The broker said expectations for the General Insurance business would have been further bolstered by
IAG's pre announcement on July 24 with a similarly strong underlying margin expected for SUN along with
a less weak revenue outcome.

Readers comment

Two Readers, to whom grateful thanks, put "pen to paper" on awareness of the lessons from the history of
the Western world and refrain from judgement on the Middle East:

(abridged)

*One Reader said "It took the British several hundred years (from 1066 to about the 1800-1900s) to make
the transition to something resembling our modern view of civilised society and .. not without massive
bloodshed, inhumanity and turmoil... I work in IT and in any IT implementation this process of change
management of the people is one of the biggest project activities and it is a lot more than just training in
the new system...

"The social changes, and in particular the recognition that women are actually people with equal rights,
have been massive. .. Remember the hoo-hah around women in public bars, the first female pilot, equal
wages and we've only just in recent years become used to female leadership in any areas (let alone
politics and business). I can remember some apprehension at my first female boss .. And then there is our
very own boat people fiasco, starting with jailing of children and just going on from there. All accepted in
very recent (and even current) times.

"We shouldn't even start on racial discrimination issues ..

"I don't have an answer any more than anyone else, but one does really believe that if one ignores the
violent and totally misaligned extremists that exist in every society and are so visible in the Middle East
(and elsewhere) today then it should be possible to work out what the people want and progress towards
it".

Page51of239©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*The other Reader said, "As if the Americans and their lackeys in Britain and of course good old Oz
haven't created enough terror, which future generations will come to curse when the inevitable payback
ensues, there's Julie Bishop and almost in lockstep, Labour's Bill Shorten jumping back into Iraq as a
"humanitarian mission". And of course our media/Western media as it leads public opinion applauds this
'strength"."

Both Readers separately agreed that fundamentally, all of us are the same and want the same things from
life for ourselves and our families, irrespective of race, religion, culture or degree of civilisation.

One Reader added, "The smile on a baby's face is the same the world over".
