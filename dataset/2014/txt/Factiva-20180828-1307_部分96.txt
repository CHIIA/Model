Gold futures fell for the fourth time in five sessions as a U.S. equity rally reduces demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose on speculation that
the crisis at Portugal's Espirito Santo SA will be contained. U.S. data showed Aug. 1 that employers
added more than 200,000 jobs for the sixth straight month. Last week, gold dropped 0.8 percent, the
third straight decline.

Raw sugar erased gains in New York after a warehouse fire caused only minor damage in Brazil, the
world's largest exporter of the sweetener. About 15,000 metric tons of sugar were destroyed at the Port
of Santos warehouse owned by Cosan SA Industria e Comercio's Rumo logistics unit, the company said
by e-mail. Brazil will produce 36.8 million tons in the season that started in May, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.

Soybeans gained the most in a week on concern that dry Midwest weather is eroding crop quality just as
demand increases for supplies from the U.S., the world's top grower. Corn and wheat also rose. About
70 per cent of the soybean crop was probably in good or excellent condition as of yesterday, down from
71 per cent a week earlier, a Bloomberg survey showed. Exporters sold 110,000 metric tons to China
and 102,000 tons to Taiwan for delivery.
