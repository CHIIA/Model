BANKS UP BUT BONDS DUMPED - MARKET CLOSES UP 0.3% FOR WEEK

Our market closed up 12.9 points to 5492.8, almost exactly as expected, on reasonable volume worth
$3.7 billion, with the banks the only gainers - resources were slightly weaker and all other sectors were
flat.

The Ukraine election and EU zone elections on the weekend are probably helping to establish "risk off"
trading, but why our bonds have been dumped after rising 6 points last evening is more puzzling - Aussie
10 year bond yields this afternoon have risen 15 points to 3.8%. The $A is at 92.41 US c, down about 20
points from last evening.

*Over the week our market rose 13.8 points or 0.3% to 5492.8.

Although our market is trading 74.6% above its March 6 2009 low and only 19.6% below the all time high
of 6828.7 hit on November 1 2007, it is not a healthy bull market. "Real" bull markets are a tide that lifts
all ships. But who is to say things will not continue as they are, so long as interest rates remain too low to
attract the super fund owners, and punters run scared - while our high yield stocks remain highly
attractive to countries with decimal point returns (if that)?
*Alumina rose 6c to $1.48.5 on 18.6m shares on an expected lift in China's demand, given that
Indonesian export of bauxite has now been stopped.
(However China has a stockpile enough for one year's consumption, Reuters reported - and who's to say
Indonesia won't reverse its ruling at some time).

*Treasury Wine rose 23c to $5.17 on 9.2m shares on newspaper reports that Bright Foods may be
looking at a purchase.

*Spotless returned to the boards in a gala debut, closing at $1.71.5 on 87.13m shaers following an IPO
price of $1.60.

*World Reach rose 10.5c to 25.5c on 1.15m shares after saying yesterday a new type of satellite will lift
earnings.

*Applabs announced it has partnered with Archimedes to jointly collaborate and co invest in quality vetted
technology start ups. The shares rose 4.5c to 23.5c on 3.9m traded.

*Regis fell 57c to $1.71 on 13.9m shares in spite of reporting production in line with analyst expectations
although costs were higher.

Among the Top Twenty over the week ANZ was the winner, rising 66c or 2% to $33.60 followed by
Suncorp, up 25c or 1.9% to $13.63 and Telstra, up 9c or 1.7% to $5.38.

On the downside, RIO fell furthest, down 141c or 2.3% to $60.54 followed by Fortescue, down 7c or 1.5%
to $4.51 and with Brambles and BHP each down 1.1%, or 11c to $9.67 and 43c to $37.65 respectively.

*At 4pm AEST the Nikkei Dow futures was up 180 points to 14,490 points, Shanghai CSI physical had
gained 5.51 points to 2026.80, Hang Seng futures was up 26 points to 22,941 points, S&P futures was up
1.10 points to1891.30, Nasdaq futures was up 3.5 points to 3651.50, Dow futures was up 12 points to
16,540 points.
Spot gold was up $1 to $1295. Crude futures were up 7c to $103.81.
