appreciable cash outflows at current uranium prices.

-- Continued steady production at both Langer Heinrich and Kayelekera mines

in March quarter.

-- combined production of 2.089Mlb (948t) U3O8.
-- production was down slightly by 5% from December quarter mainly

due to fewer days in the quarter and rundown in production at
Kayelekera in preparation for care and maintenance.

-- Langer Heinrich produced 1,392,694lb (632t) U3O8 for the March quarter,

4% above budget.

-- overall recovery for the quarter was 85.8%.
-- feed grade for the quarter down to 750ppm U3O8.

-- Kayelekera produced 696,710lb (316t) U3O8 for the quarter, in line with

Page102of283©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.the revised care and maintenance budget.
-- recovery of 86.7% for the quarter.
-- announcement on February 7 to place the project on care and

maintenance due to low uranium price with production expected to
continue until early May when reagent stocks will be depleted.

-- Revised production guidance of 7.8Mlb to 8.0Mlb for FY14 remains on

track.

SAFETY
The Company incurred nine lost time injuries (LTIs) across the organisation for the quarter - six at Langer
Heinrich Mine (LHM), two at Kayelekera Mine (KM) and one in exploration. At LHM, two were lower back
injuries, two ankle injuries, one wrist dislocation and one fingertip injury. At KM, both involved minor
fractures (leg and thumb). The exploration injury involved hypothermia. Full investigations have been
conducted and recommendations made and are being implemented. The Company's 12-month moving
average Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) increased to 2.8 from 1.0.

A major health and safety review was undertaken at LHM. This identified several areas for improvement
including additional safety training, which is a major initiative for the next 12-24 months. The annual
NOSA CMB 253 (HSE) audit was conducted at LHM and resulted in a 3-star Platinum accreditation
dropping from its 4 star rating the previous year.
QUARTERLY URANIUM SALES

Sales

Sales for the quarter were 2,405,159lb U(3) O(8) , generating revenue of US$88.56M, representing an
average sales price of US$36.82/lb U(3) O(8) (average weekly Ux spot price for the quarter was
US$35.15/lb U(3) O(8) ).

mined during the period, but the ore grade was significantly higher than in the previous quarters. The
majority of waste material mined came from Pit H on the western side of the open cut. Mining also
commenced in Pit G3 during the quarter.
ROM ore stocks have been maintained at approximately four weeks' supply and are being supplemented
by medium grade ore from long term stockpiles in line with the plant's blend requirements.

All operating mines in the area, including LHM, are now obtaining the majority of their water supplies
under a water supply agreement executed with NamWater in November 2013 using marine desalinated
water from existing infrastructure. Since being signed, LHM has been receiving a reliable and secure
water supply.

Uranium production for the March quarter was affected by the consequences of transitioning KM towards
a care and maintenance status. This announcement was made on February 7 and the plant was shut
down for the 3 days after the announcement was made to facilitate the transition. Production is consistent
with the revised guidance provided in that announcement.
Mining

There was no mining production during the March quarter as a result of both the mining cessation over
the Christmas break and the decision to proceed to care and maintenance. There are sufficient existing
ROM stockpiles to feed the plant while the mine transitions toward care and maintenance.

Product Shipment Incident, Feb 10, 2014
22 Apr 2014 06:00 ET Press Release: Paladin Energy Ltd Quarterly -2-

As previously reported, there was an incident with a routine product shipment on February 10 where a
small quantity (30kg) of Class 7 uranium product concentrate was spilled a short distance from the mine
in Malawi. A truck travelling in convoy failed to make a turn while headed from the mine to the Port of
Walvis Bay in Namibia. The truck tipped to its side damaging the cargo container. The driver suffered only
minor injuries and there were no consequent health or environmental impacts. The small area involved
with the spillage was cleaned up and radiologically tested and Malawi's Atomic Energy Regulatory
Authority declared that it was satisfied with Company's response and clean-up procedure.

Care and Maintenance
On February 7, the Company announced that KM would be placed on care and maintenance due to the
low uranium price and non-profitability of the operation. With this decision being taken, the plant will now
operate until all necessary reagents in the supply chain are run down and consumed to the maximum
extent possible. Currently, it is anticipated that the plant will continue to produce into early May. During
care and maintenance staffing levels will be reduced as appropriate.

During the period of care and maintenance, subject to being granted the necessary exploration licences,
exploration work will be carried out on the existing Mining Lease and adjoining tenements. This work will

Page105of283©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.be focused on expanding the current mineral resource base in order to extend the project life once
operations resume. A number of social community programmes will be continued.
It is expected that production will restart once the uranium price provides a sufficient incentive (circa
US$75/lb) and the ESCOM grid power is available on site to replace the diesel generators with much
lower cost hydro electricity.

PRODUCTION GUIDANCE FORECAST FOR FY14

Production for FY14 is expected to be within the 7.8Mlb - 8Mlb U(3) O(8) range specified in the revised
guidance announced on February 7, 2014 as a result of placing the Kayelekera operation on care and
maintenance.
AURORA - MICHELIN URANIUM PROJECT, Canada (100%)

The winter drilling programme was completed in March for a total of 15 holes for 4,432m. The results are
currently being collated. Also, another 608 line kilometres of ground magnetic surveys were completed.
The exploration camp was closed late March until the commencement of the forthcoming summer field
season in August.

CORPORATE
Sale of Minority Interest in Langer Heinrich Mine, Namibia

On January 20, 2014 Paladin announced that it had signed an agreement to sell a 25% joint-venture
equity stake in its flagship Langer Heinrich uranium mining operation in Namibia to China Uranium
Corporation Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CNNC, the leading Chinese nuclear utility, for
consideration of US$190M.
The offtake component of the agreement will allow CNNC to purchase its pro-rata share of product at the
prevailing market spot price. There is also an opportunity for Paladin to benefit by securing additional long
term offtake arrangements with CNNC, at arm's length market rates, from Paladin's share of Langer
Heinrich production.
Completion is now subject only to certain Chinese regulatory approvals (including the National
Development and Reform Commission), which are expected to be obtained by June 2014. Consents for
the transaction from Paladin's project financiers and the Bank of Namibia have been received and as a
consequence on 16 April 2014 the US$20M deposit paid by CNNC has been released from escrow to
Paladin and is non-refundable.

Securing CNNC as a joint-venture partner is considered a significant achievement by Paladin given
CNNC's stature and high regard in China and internationally due to its ability to develop, build and
operate nuclear power plants. Having this highly respected member of the Chinese nuclear power
industry participating in Langer Heinrich is a very important and positive development for both the
Company and for Namibia.

Successful Refinancing of Langer Heinrich and Kayelekera Facilities

On January 17, 2014, Paladin announced it had entered into agreements with its lenders to refinance the
LHM and the KM project finance facilities. This new facility provides significant cash flow benefits to both
projects and leaves Paladin in a much stronger financial position. The annual principal repayments across
both projects have been reduced from US$53.8M to US$18.3M in CY2014, a substantial reduction of
US$35.5M, with the first repayment not being due until June 2014. In CY2015, annual principal
repayments under the existing facilities compared to the new facility will be reduced by a further
US$23.7M.

The KM finance facility (currently US$48.1M) was repaid in full immediately, however, the facility and
existing security arrangements will remain in place to support the US$10M Performance Bond.
Overall, this rationalisation in the project financing reduces the Company's debt position and, by
substantially reducing repayments over the next three years, conserves operational cash flow.
Sale of Shareholding by Newmont Mining Corporation
The Company announced on March 12, 2014 that Newmont Mining Corporation sold its 5.4%
shareholding in Paladin through a book-build process. The sale was underwritten by investment bank
UBS at a fixed price of $0.525 per share and Paladin has been informed the shares were sold to a broad
range of institutional investors.

Page106of283©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Newmont acquired the shareholding through its acquisition of Fronteer Gold in 2011, which had
previously sold the Aurora uranium assets in Canada to Paladin. Paladin understands the sale is
consistent with Newmont's strategy of divesting non-core assets to align its investment interests with its
global gold production business.
URANIUM MARKET OUTLOOK
The spot uranium price was reported at US$34.50/lb at the beginning of the quarter before rising to
US$35.75/lb in mid-February. The price retreated to US$34.00/lb by the end of March. In February, as a
potential sign the market is bottoming out, Uranium Participation Corporation, secured financing totalling
C$57.6M and to date has reportedly purchased a total of 850,000lb for near-term delivery.

The term contracting market has begun to show activity, as a large US nuclear utility requested offers for
deliveries spanning 2016-2022. Paladin believes that increasing term contracting will strengthen the term
price as the year progresses and additional term demand enters the market.
On April 11, 2014 the Japanese government approved a new energy policy, which incorporates nuclear
as "an important base-load energy source". This new Energy Basic Plan defines nuclear energy as an
important part of the energy fuel mix Japan intends adopting and calls for the restart of their idled
reactors. The independent Nuclear Regulatory Authority agreed to place two reactors, Kyushu Electric's
Sendai 1 & 2, on an expedited review process, which could lead to restarts by mid-year. Recent forecasts
of reactor restarts envision 5-8 reactors operating by end of CY2014 and circa 32 reactors by end of
CY2016.

In another important development, after extensive debate and numerous drafts, the European
Commission on April 9, 2014 adopted, in principle, the new rules designed to replace subsidies for
renewables with market based schemes. The rules will take effect from July 1, 2014 and from 2017 all
member states will be required to adopt the new process, following a pilot phase during 2015-16. These
new rules are seen as being supportive of nuclear generation development due to the introduction of
market realities into renewable generation economics.
