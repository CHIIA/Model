China's services PMI in July came in at 50, the lowest since the series began in November 2005 and
down from 53.1 in June, HSBC/Markit reported.
China's lower services PMI was something of a dampener for all Asian markets while our widening
deficit, and perhaps also the RBA's expectation of below trend growth this year, as reported in its
statement today would also have weighed on the market.

Our market closed down 22.3 points to 5518.6, falling through the 5535/40 level of support, led down by
the banks with resources also weaker. On near average volume worth $3.82 billion.

*Cochlear starred, up $6.46 to $69 on 1m shares after reporting a result in line but several new products
to be released in the short term - had been seen as "ex R&D" by some.

*Treasury Group rose 76c to $10.43 on 198,964 shares on a major leap into becoming a US and
Australia boutique investment group.

*Credit Corp rose 29c to $9.10 9on 340,225 shars after a splendid result.

*Downer EDI fell 20ct o $4.58 on 4.2m shares on continuing difficult times ahead.

*Transurban closed down 7c to $7.58 on 5m shares on a no-surprises profit report.

*Crown Resorts fell 62c to $15.20 on 10.14m shares. A leading broker retained a 'sell" on Crown with a
12 month price target of $20.80.

The broker said Las Vegas is arguably the most high profile gaming market in the world and a "Crown"
branded integrated resort would round out the group's global portfolio. On the downside, the Las Vegas
market is mature and is highly competitive, which in the broker's view limits the potential return on
investment.

The broker said key risks relate to Macau regulation, consumer slowdown, overspend on new projects.
