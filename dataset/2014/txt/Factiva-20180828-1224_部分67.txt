Aviation - International division hived off
Qantas is setting up a holding company for its international division - a change that could allow it to
sell up to 49 per cent of the business to an outside investor.

The move was made possible by changes to the QantasSale Act that removed restrictions on a single
airline owning more than 25 per cent or a group of airlines owning more than 35 per cent of the
company.

Chief executive Alan Joyce said the split increased the potential for investment, but cautioned it could
take time to find an investor interested in the business, which is unprofitable.
Mr Joyce said the immediate focus was on cutting $2 billion of costs over three years, of which up to
$1 billion will come from the international division.

He said the division would benefit from the airline's reduction in employees and fuel consumption,
closure of a maintenance base at Avalon, and changes such as making better use of ground power
units.

Qantas also intends to increase the use of its international fleet by 6 per cent by adding flights that will
lead its A380s and 747s to spend more time in the air.

As it prepares to hive off the international division, Qantas is looking again at whether to pursue a split
of its Air Operator's Certificates, or licences to fly, so that the domestic and international business
each have their own. That plan was put on ice in February.
The decision to split the international business triggered the need for the airline to make $2.6 billion
of write-downs on its international fleet of A380s, 747s and A330s.

The impairments could, however, help the international business return to profitability, because future
depreciation costs will be reduced by $200 million a year.

Mr Joyce would not be drawn on when he expected the international business to stop losing money.
"I'm not going to speculate when that is going to occur, but this [international split] is aimed at allowing
us to seek further investment around the international business," he said.
Qantas has previously said it will not exercise options or purchase rights over 50 Boeing 787-9s until
its international business stops losing money. On Thursday, it pushed back the timing of the first
options to be exercised to 2017 from 2016.

shareholders, who were concerned the airline could sell a stake in the profitable domestic arm and
dilute their exposure to it.

Potential investors in the international business could include code-share partners such as Emirates,
China Southern and China Eastern.

But StrategicAero Research strategist Saj Ahmad said he doubted any airline would be interested in
buying a stake while the business was losing money. "I honestly cannot see anyone lining up to take
a stake here - it would be like pouring money down the drain," he said.
