1 Jul 2014 06:34 ET Frasers Centrepoint Makes Formal Bid to Buy Australand for A$2.59 Bln

By P.R. Venkat and Chun Han Wong

SINGAPORE--A property developer controlled by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi on
Tuesday made a formal offer to buyAustraland Property Group (ALZ.AU), an Australian residential
developer and office landlord, in a deal valued at 2.59 billion Australian dollars (US$2.45 billion).
Singapore-based Frasers Centrepoint Ltd. (TQ5.SG) agreed to go ahead with its offer to buy
Australand after completing due diligence on the deal, which was first announced in early June as a
non-binding offer, both companies said in separate disclosures filed to the Australian Securities
Exchange.

Frasers's all-cash bid at A$4.48 per Australand security trumps a rival share-based offer from
Australia's Stockland Group that was equivalent to paying A$4.43 per Australand security. Stockland
already owns 19.9% of Australand.

Australand's directors have unanimously decided to recommend Frasers's offer to shareholders,
subject to an assessment by independent experts that concludes that the offer is "fair and reasonable,"
and in the absence of a superior bid, the Australian developer said in its disclosure.

Australand's appeal as a takeover target heightened in March after Singaporean developer CapitaLand
Ltd. sold its remaining 39.1% stake in the company to focus on opportunities at home and in China.
Frasers's bid for Australand comes on the heels of several acquisitions in Australia's property sector.
In May, Frasers said it agreed to buy a hotel in Sydney for about A$202.7 million, months after Dexus
Property Group and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board struck a A$3 billion deal to buy the
Commonwealth Property Office Fund.

Frasers itself was acquired last year by Mr. Charoen, who made his fortune in the liquor business
before diversifying into real estate and other sectors. The Thai tycoon bought the Singaporean
developer's then parent, Fraser & Neave Ltd., in a complex takeover that valued the target company at
about US$11 billion.
