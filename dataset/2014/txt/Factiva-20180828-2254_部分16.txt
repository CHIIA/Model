MARKETS SYDNEY, Nov 28 AAP - A roundup of trading on major world markets:

NEW YORK - The US markets were closed for the Thanksgiving public holiday.

LONDON - Borrowing costs for the German and French governments have fallen to record lows on the
prospect of quantitative easing in the struggling eurozone, while the euro slid further and stocks gained.

In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 climbed 0.60 per cent to 9,974.87 points and in Paris the CAC 40 rose 0.20
per cent to 4,382.34 points.
London's benchmark FTSE 100 index was pulled down, however, by falling prices for energy company
stocks after the OPECoil cartel decided not to cut output despite a supply gut, ending off 0.09 per cent
at 6,723.42 points.

A signal by a senior ECB official on Wednesday that the central bank could begin major purchases of
government bonds of eurozone countries sent the yields, or interest paid, on them down as investors
tried to lock in returns.
HONG KONG - Asian stocks were mixed in lacklustre trade, while oil prices hit a new four-year low
ahead of a pivotal OPEC meeting expected to maintain the cartel's production levels despite a huge
glut.
Tokyo stocks lost 0.78 per cent on Thursday as a stronger yen took the wind out of the market ahead
of the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see US markets closed Thursday and open for shortened trade
on Friday.
The Hang Seng Index fell 0.45 per cent or 107.70 points to 24,004.28 on turnover of HK$72.888 billion
(US$9.4 billion) ahead of an Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decision on
quotas and after an unexpected drop in Chinese industrial profits.

Coming in at its highest close in more than three years, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
gained 1.00 per cent, or 26.15 points, to 2,630.49 on turnover of 339.0 billion yuan ($55.2 billion). It
was the exchange's highest ending since August 4, 2011.
The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, rose 0.75 per cent,
or 10.52 points, to 1,416.18 on turnover of 270.6 billion yuan.

Sydney edged up 0.09 per cent to close at 5,400.9 points, with Seoul also ending up slightly by 0.06 per
cent to 1,982.09 points.

WELLINGTON - The NZX 50 Index fell 2.014 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 5455.378.
