changes to both its channel and product mix in addition to the introduction of the lower margin/higher

the relaunch of the GAP brand in Australia) and any possible acquisition or capital management
initiatives'.

"Breakthrough" acid dip stem cell creation research withdrawn

(Reuters) - A Japanese scientist called on Monday for his own headline-grabbing study on stem cells to
be withdrawn from publication, saying its findings had now been thrown into too much doubt.

The research - hailed when it came out in January as a breakthrough that could herald a new era of
medical biology - was covered widely in Japan and across the world after it was published in the highly
reputable science journal Nature.

But since then, there have been reports that other scientists have been unable to replicate the Japanese
team's results and that there may have been problems with its data and images.

"It is no longer clear what is right," Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor at Japan's University of Yamanashi
who was part of the researcher team, told public broadcaster NHK.

The study, described as game changing by independent experts asked to comment on it when it was
published, appeared to show a simple way to reprogram mature animal cells back into an embryonic-like
state that would allow them to generate many types of tissue.

The results appeared to offer a promise that human cells might in future be simply and cheaply
reprogrammed back into embryonic cell-like cells - in this case cells dubbed Stimulus-Triggered
Acquisition of Pluripotency, or STAP, cells - suggesting a simple way to replace damaged cells or grow
new organs for sick and injured people.

"When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely right," Wakayama said.

"But now that many mistakes have emerged, I think it is best to withdraw the research paper once and,
using correct data and correct pictures, to prove once again the paper is right. If it turns out to be wrong,
we would need to make it clear why a thing like this happened."
