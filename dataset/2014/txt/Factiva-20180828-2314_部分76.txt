Loss-making Yancoal Australia Ltd. plans to restructure its debts by raising $3.5 billion of new loans,
including $3 billion from majority owner Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. Ltd.. Sydney-based Yancoal said it
will sell $2.3 billion of subordinated capital notes to existing shareholders. Yanzhou, of China, will buy
$1.8 billion of the notes before receiving the same amount to repay its senior loans to Yancoal. The sale
of the notes is a prerequisite to Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. extending by
three years the first capital repayment on a $2.6 billion syndicated loan to Yancoal. Yanzhou will also
provide Yancoal with a further A$1.4 billion ($1.2 billion) in the form of a 10-year committed funding
facility and promised that it will ensure that Yancoal remains solvent. Yancoal made an Ebit loss of A$186
million in the first half of 2014, which it blamed on lower coal prices and a strong Australian dollar. The
company lost A$154 million in 2013 and A$28 million in 2012.

Deutsche Bank AG has been tapped to manage the sale of the notes. -Paul Whitfield
