Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest knows better than most how movements in commodity prices can cause
havoc with your bank balance.
With iron ore prices falling to its lowest in close to a year, shares in Fortescue Metals Group tumbled
more then 9 per cent on Monday, wiping about $450 million off the value of Forrest's stake.

Since February 21, when FMG's shares broke through $6 for the first time since early 2012, the stock
has dropped by about 18 per cent to close at $4.92 on Monday.
That drop has wiped $1.1 billion off the value of Forrest's stake in a matter of 11 trading days. His
stake is now worth $5.1 billion.
Calculating the impact of the iron ore price movement on other iron ore moguls such as Gina
Rinehart and Angela Bennett isn't as transparent, although given they both rely on royalties paid by
Rio Tinto – which mines tenements owned by their fathers, Lang Hancock and Peter Wright – the
share price of that company can be seen as a very rough proxy.

Rio shares dipped 5.76 per cent to close at $61.20 on Monday. Since February 21, Rio's stock is
down 12.9 per cent.

BHP Billiton shares lost 4.14 per cent on Monday, to close at $36.16. The stock is down 7.8 per cent
since February 21.Fortune seesaws
Forrest has regularly felt the impact of the iron ore prices on his wealth. In 2008, with iron ore spot
prices soaring towards $US200 a tonne, shares in FMG jumped and Twiggy's fortune soared to
$9.4 billion, making him Australia's richest person. A year later, with the spot price back around
$US60, Twiggy's fortune was put at $2.4 billion as FMG shares slumped.
With the iron ore price dropping 2 per cent to $US114.20 a tonne – the lowest price since June 2013
– on the back of more disappointing data from China, Forrest appears to have taken a step back
onto that wealth roller-coaster.
The drop in the iron ore price is certainly causing jitters at all ends of the mining sector; last week
Citi downgraded its long-term earnings expectations for BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. FMG and Atlas
Iron were also downgraded.
Citi is forecasting iron ore will slip to $113 a tonne this year – and obviously it's already very close to
that level – before sliding to $90 in 2015 and $80 in 2016. It then expects the price will see a "modest
rebound".

Given the way his fortune and FMG's share price have gyrated wildly over the years, Forrest is
unlikely to be too concerned about Monday's losses.

current level of $US114 a tonne, but Forrest's FMG stake has risen from $4.2 billion $5.3 billion.
He even took home more than $100 million when FMG surprised the market by announcing a
dividend with its half-year results.Share price more resilient
It could be argued that FMG's share price should be bit more resilient to iron ore price movements
than it was in 2008, when it was an iron ore hopeful rather than a true iron ore miner.

Indeed, JP Morgan Lyndon Fagan last week upgraded the stock with a bullish price target of $6.85,
compared with the current share price of $5.43.
His take is based on a $US90 a tonne iron ore price, but he says that FMG's pre-tax break-even
price has dropped $US20 a tonne to $US83 a tonne and says the company "can now remain in
positive cash flow territory", even if prices remain "significantly" lower for longer.

Fagan also argues that FMG has shored up its balance sheet and strengthened its production, which,
like most of the Pilbara producers, is rising.
"The key question remains whether FMG can outperform in a structurally declining iron ore pricing
environment," Fagan wrote in a note to clients.
"While we acknowledge the iron ore price could be volatile this year as the market adjusts to new
supply, we believe the imminent de-risking of FMG's production and balance sheet present a
compelling outlook for it to outperform this year."

If you agree with Fagan's take, then there could be some very attractive buying opportunities around
a stock like FMG.

But be ready for some ups and downs – as Andrew Forrest knows only too well, life is never boring
with iron ore stocks.READ NEXT: Iron ore price falls 2pc as China economy drags
