THE site of the now defunct Birubi Beach Resort is finally being offered for sale, five months after it
was placed in the hands of receivers.
Stonebridge Property Group, a Sydney-based commercial realtor, has been given control of the sale
of the 4.13-hectare beach-side property in Port Stephens, once the proposed site for a $50 million
resort that was plagued by work stoppages, late payments to contractors and court battles almost
since its inception in 2011.

The site has approval for 198 tourist units, but the partial commencement has clouded any guide for its
value. Whatever the outcome, most residents will be relieved to see the site - which has turned into a
sand swept, graffiti riddled eyesore - on the market.
In May the Newcastle Herald revealed the site had been placed with administrators after financier,
Chinese companyChina Security and Surveillance Technology, pulled the plug on the local
developers.
Expressions of interest on the sale are being sought until November 12.
