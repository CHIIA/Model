The Market Callers

Over the half year (aphabetically), Ben made 24 calls, "Bernborough" made 34, Daniel made 29, "Maree"
made 32 and Gerald made 3 for a total of 122 calls during the six months (vs 106 calls last year). Over the
last six months, in a capricious market there have been 18 perfect calls vs 28 for the previous June half.

There were 25 "wrong way" calls over this June half vs 26 wrong way calls for the previous corresponding
period. Altogether for 80% of the time, we have been steered in the right direction, grateful thanks to the
team.

(Interesting to note that in the December 2012 half, with the market in a much more predictable direction,
eg "down" there were 62 perfect calls and 21 thereabouts and negligible "wrong way" calls).

For the second time in the last six years (12 half years) we have a draw - Ben Faulkner and "Bernborough"
are equal firsts.

(The previous draw was also between "Bernborough", and Daniel who at that time was "Galileo").

announced further high grade gold mineralisation has been intersected at the Discovery Prospect in a
recent aircore drilling program at the Four Eagles Gold Project, 70 m north of Bendigo in Victoria.
Catalyst now has an interest in tenements covering the entire gold potential of the Bendigo North area.

Vertical aircore hole FE 663 intersected 3m grading 59 gpt Au from 102m in a semi massive quartz vein
just below the basement contact. Another totally separate sample from the same interval assayed 3m at
7gpt Au which suggests that coarse gold may be present in the area.

Initial assays from the smaller 30 gram sample showed values of 95.6gpt Au and 2.7gpt Au respectively.
All samples, whether small or large contain good grade gold values, supporting the premise at Four
Eagles that the gold distribution is predominantly finely divided. This is different to the experience at
Bendigo where most gold occurs in very coarse particles, making assay repeatability difficult.
