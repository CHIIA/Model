Undecided on WCB shares: BEGA Cheese has talked with overseas investors about potentially selling
its 18.8 per cent stake in Warrnambool Cheese and Butter. But the company is refusing to fuel
speculation that Chinese investors are among those approaching it with offers. Bega officials said the
company had not decided whether it would sell, or if so, when it would sell or to whom. Canadian milk
giant Saputo is hoping to win Bega's 10.5 million WCB shares having almost matched Bega's holding
after recent market acceptances gave the global business a potential 17.92pc. Murray Goulburn,
another 17pc stakeholder in WCB, also wants Bega's shares, which industry speculation suggested may
be "on the market" for more than $10 each.
