Channel Nine has been linked to the $7.3 million purchase of a hotel and adjacent car park in South
Yarra, Melbourne with suggestions it could be used for next year's season of hit renovation show The
Block.
The octagonal Hotel Saville on Commercial Road and a car park on Punt Road were sold to a local
development group through Colliers International agents Ben Baines and Ted Dwyer. A spokeswoman
for Channel Nine said "we have no response at this time".

It is common practice for Channel Nine not to reveal the locations of future series. Larry Schlesinger
