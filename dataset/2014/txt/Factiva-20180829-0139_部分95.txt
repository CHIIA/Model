CHINCHILLA

BUSINESS confidence in Chinchilla has been bolstered after Queensland Gas
Corporationpurchased a sizeable stake in the Surat Basin Industrial Park.

The substantial investment in the estate is the latest in a line of transactions involving energy
company divisions and service providers in recent months.
Surat Basin Property Group CEO Jason van Hooft said the QGC decision to invest heavily in
Chinchilla was a major vote of confidence for the area.
“The site they have purchased is at the entry to the industrial estate and involves three lots
with a total area of approximately two hectares,” he said.
“The site is suitable for a large industrial building, storage facilities and a hard stand and we
believe QGC is looking at its options and plans currently.

“The centre will provide a base from which they service all their Surat Basin gas operations.”
