Our market has weakened as evidence that China's economy is slowing piles up, with a glut of metals
particularly given massive expansion by the iron ore miners, likely to lead to sharply lower prices. Apart
from the export of soft commodities and a likely increase in tourism given the weaker $A, with
manufacturing in Australia declining sharply there seems to be little to replace the expected job losses and
lost export income. Stocks - of all sizes - with strong overseas income remain attractive.

"Support at 5300, resistance at 5330 then at 5345, down 10 points on the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500's uptrend is still in tact, just consolidating
this week pending the reporting season. 1840 seems to be a bit of resistance, it has struggled to push
through 1840 this week with fairly strong support at 1825.

"The Shanghai market is still pretty week. It is in short term down trend. The critical 2000 level has
managed to hold, worth keeping an eye on.
"Gold is consolidating in a short range.

"The XJO performance has been pretty weak against the US markets this week. There seems to be plenty
of selling pressure at the 5350 level where it ran into profit taking.

"Yesterday it closed on its high after four down days in a row. 5350 remains resistance on the daily chart
for this week. Yesterday it tested the 5300 level where there seems to be very strong support.

"Our market is range bound, looking for direction and is still threatening to break lower. It needs to hold
the 5300 level. If it doesn't hold, we will test 5250 and 5200 quite quickly.

"For the day I expect support at 5300 if tested to hold. Resistance is at 5330 and then at 5345.

"I'll call it down 10 points on the day following a surprising late rally yesterday - it may give some of that
back".

*NEN/Others: Cua Lo-1 being plugged and abandoned, development unlikely
Neon Energy advised testing of the Cua Lo-1 exploration well, located in Block 105-110/04 offshore
Vietnam has been completed. The drill stem test was conducted over a period of five days between
2,397m and 2,435m in the 4.5Ma sandstone reservoir, chosen as it offered the greatest resource potential
at this location. The presence of gas was confirmed with a peak flow rate of 400,000 scf/d through a 16/64
inch choke. Although gas flowed during the test, poor reservoir deliverability combined with high carbon
dioxide content suggests development of the reservoir at this location is unlikely. Operator ENI is
proceeding to plug and abandon the well. ENI 50% and operator, NEN 25%, KrisEnergy 25%.

*RXL: Shallow hi grade Ni mineralisation extended at Fisher project

Rox Resources Ltd announced laboratory assays from the RC drilling program previously reported at its

in two separate locations, Cannonball and Musket, along the strike of the Camelwood ultramafic unit.
Each mineralised zone is over 200m in strike length indicating a southern strike continuation of the
mineralisation at Camelwood where a mineral resource of 1.6Mt at 2.2% Ni has been defined.
Mineralisation remains open at depth and is largely unexplored.
