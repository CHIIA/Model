--------------------

INVESTORS LOOKING for a bet on Australia's rural sector could do worse than follow the lead of former
Australian Test cricketer Adam Gilchrist.

Gilchrist is proving to be an astute businessman thanks to his somewhat risky decision to back the the
owner and manager of the world's biggest Indian sandalwood plantations, TFS Corporation.
His shareholding in the Australian-listed company has doubled in value to A$2.5 million ($2.7m) in the
past six months.

Gilchrist, who hit 5570 Test runs at an average of 47.6 and took 379 Test catches in his keeper's gloves,
attached his good name and reputation to TFS in mid 2010.

That was risky because the Australian market for managed investment schemes (MIS) was in meltdown
after various collapses had wiped out more than $1 billion in investors' savings.

Companies involved in MIS projects which collapsed included Timbercorp, Great Southern, Willmott
Forests, Forest Enterprises Australia and Gunns.
Gilchrist showed considerable commercial nous in deciding to back a company that was exposed to the
risks that retail and institutional investors would no longer back - rural enterprises with very long periods
between the initial investment and the final return.

It can take 14 years to 16 years for an Indian sandalwood tree to reach maturity. Most of the MIS
companies that collapsed were offering blue gum or pine trees.

TFS Corporation has not only survived the fallout from the widespread collapses but has started to deliver
what no other company could: a financial return.
The company started its first Indian sandalwood plantation in 1999 and this is being harvested this
financial year.

Australia has a long history of sporting figures getting involved in enterprises that go bad. Former Test
fast bowler Brett Lee and former Test batsman Michael Slater endorsed dodgy property developer
Kovelan Bangaru.

an Adelaide broking firm, Harry Hodgetts, embezzled funds from about 238 clients without Bradman's
knowledge.

Gilchrist began his relationship with TFS Corporation as global ambassador. He was responsible for
promoting the sandalwood products in India where he is a household name. Also, he was called on to
promote the company's retail prospectus MIS offerings.

He has put his money where his mouth is by investing in the typical retail allotment of about 1.3 hectares,
which comprises 12 lots at a cost of about A$6600 each.

Read a prospectus for a TFS sandalwood project and it quickly becomes obvious why many investors
have steered clear of the sector.

There are multiple fees charged over the period of the investment and there is plenty of cream for the
manager of the business if the product attracts more returns than expected.

The attraction for many Australian investors in MIS schemes was the tax deductibility. The entire initial
investment is tax deductible. Investors are often encouraged to borrow the money up front, which adds
another layer of tax deductibility.

TFS Corporation has its own financing arm called Arwon Finance. The quality of the loan book has
remained strong as evidenced by the fact that a portfolio of loans was sold last year for A$22 million.

However, the real win for Gilchrist and other investors in the past year has been through the movement in
the TFS Corporation share price. It has risen about 130 per cent since last year when it became clear that
the company would actually harvest some trees.

The first harvest is a relatively small one because the initial sandalwood stock from the West Australian
Department of Agriculture had inferior qualities and only 25 per cent of the trees survived.
The company now prepares its own seedlings.

Indian sandalwood is a parasite that must get its nutrients and water from other trees to survive. That
does not increase the risks involved but it still takes a lot of faith from investors to commit to a project that
will not deliver for 14 years to 16 years.

Over the past 14 years, TFS Corporation has gradually increased its annual planting of Indian
sandalwood. Its annual planting is now running at about 1500 hectares a year.
The company's total Indian sandalwood estate under management is now 7580 hectares in Western
Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland.

TFS Corporation differs from the failed MIS companies in that it owns 2084 hectares, or about one- third
of its total estate. Shareholders will benefit from the long-term growth.
The first Indian sandalwood from the harvest in September last year was sold for about US$150,000 a
tonne to buyers in China. The first oil was sold for US$4000 a kilogram to a US pharmaceutical
company.

The oil from TFS Corporation plantations will be processed at a plant at Mt Romance near Albany in
Western Australia.

The latest prospectus says sandalwood is an aromatic wood that is internationally prized for use in luxury,
pharmaceutical and religious product markets.

It says the average price of wild Indian sandalwood heartwood has had a compounded increase of 16.7
per cent a year over the past 20 years due to strong demand and diminishing supply.
In India the sandalwood trees grow wild. It is illegal to export. Several broking analysts have put a buy on
the stock.
The company is expected to deliver A$2 billion of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (ebitda) over the next 15 years, according to Adam Michell at Moelis & Co.
Owen Humphries from Cannacord Genuity has given eight reasons why he likes the company including
the significant barriers to entry, the vertically integrated business model, the fact that Indian sandalwood is
the most valuable heartwood and that the stock is trading a significant discount to its intrinsic value.

plantation business. Endowment funds in the US and sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East have
invested $180 million in Indian sandalwood trees.

Gilchrist's career has certainly had plenty of variety. After years successfully swinging the willow at No 7,
Gilchrist now delivers the wood that is an important ingredient in making Chanel No 5.
