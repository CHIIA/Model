0717 GMT [Dow Jones] BHP Billiton Ltd.'s (BHP.AU) Nickel West unit has become increasingly reliant
on processing material from smaller miners and procuring more high quality third-party ore and
concentrate is "crucial for whoever owns and operates the Kalgoorlie smelter in the future," says
Deutsche Bank. BHP is considering selling the business, which the bank values at US$321 million, but
doesn't expect to post positive earnings until FY16. Miners including Western Areas Ltd. (WSA.AU)
Sirius Resources NL (SIR.AU) are due to sign new offtake agreements in 2H14 and Deutsche Bank says
Nickel West needs to secure extra concentrate in these negotiations to fill its smelter after BHP's
Perseverance mine closed. A buyer of the unit, if sold, would "likely view SIR and WSA as strategic if
Nickel West fails to sign further concentrate offtake," they add. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter:

0715 GMT [Dow Jones] Very little movement in the major currency pairs overnight as investors keep
their powder dry ahead of three days of heavy event and data risk that include the FOMC and July
nonfarm payrolls. What limited action there was took place in the Asia session, NZD slipped after dairy
giant Co-operative Group Fonterra slashed its forecast for milk payments to farmers. USD/JPY nudged
up to a 3-week high on a combination of month-end-buying and a decent 0.6% gain for the Nikkei. For
Tuesday UK mortgage and credit data are the morning data highlights, while details of fresh EU/US
sanctions against Russia may be released during the day. (gary.stride@wsj.com)

0656 GMT [Dow Jones]--Investor buying of euro zone government bonds was led by the two big guns
last week, Germany and France, according to flow analysis by Citi. On the flipside, there was net selling
of Belgium, Portugal and Ireland. On the curve, most of core demand was concentrated in the long-end.
In contrast, non-core saw most of its demand in the 2-5yr sector last week. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0646 GMT [Dow Jones] South Korea's upcoming trade data will likely show an uptrend in the latter half
of this year and support a view that the central bank will hold--rather than cut--its base rate in August,
says Barclays. "We expect the July trade report to support our view and hint at an improving trend for
activity in Q3," Barclays says. It notes the country's current account surplus is likely to continue to widen
after posting a cumulative $39.2 billion surplus in 1H. While weaker July data will make it harder for the
BOK to resist a call for a rate cut in August, Barclays says it expects the BOK to stand pat at the Aug. 14
monetary policy meeting. July trade figures will be released Aug. 1. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)

at the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday, but downside risks remain in place, says Ray Attrill, global
head of currency strategy at NAB. The fact the Aussie has given back the gains last week after second
quarter inflation data and a robust China report "keeps me encouraged in the view that the next big
move in the currency is down," Mr. Attrill said. That said, immediate upside risk for Aussie dollar would
come from a sub-3% U.S. GDP growth print on Wednesday, and/or any failure of the FOMC to move the
debate forward on the timing of Fed policy tightening, he said. (james.glynn@wsj.com)
0635 GMT [Dow Jones] China's six-session winning streak might have lifted investor sentiment, but its
sustainability over the longer term remains in doubt. Mr. Yu, a Shanghai-based investor, calls the gains
an "artificial" bull market because it is the result of Beijing's broad variety of supportive measures, such
as a mini-economic stimulus package and an expansion of the RQFII program. He says the bull market
still has legs but warns of an end in October when a cross-market stock investment program between
Shanghai and Hong Kong starts as expected. He targets the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index at
2300 in coming months. The index is up 0.4% at 2187.23. For the next year, Mr. Yu says there is no
reason to be optimistic, at least for now. (amy.li@dowjones.com)

0628 GMT [Dow Jones] Signs of a U.S. dollar rally in the near-term are appearing on the USD/JPY daily
chart. The greenback has risen above the 101.91 ceiling of the daily Ichimoku Cloud resistance zone and
on a daily close above this mark, would also be inside the Bollinger uptrend channel. The confirmation of
these two bullish technical signals suggest USD/JPY could be on its way to 102.18 - the top of the
uptrend channel - and then possibly to 102.43 where the weekly Bollinger uptrend channel awaits. The
U.S. dollar has been rising across the board before U.S. 2Q GDP data and the FOMC meeting on
Wednesday. USD/JPY is now 101.96 from its Monday close of 101.85. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)
0627 GMT [Dow Jones] The conventional association between Aussie dollar strength and China's
growth is receding, says Nomura Securities Chief FX Strategist Yunosuke Ikeda. Traditionally, strong
China growth has led to expansion in resources-related demand and a stronger AUD. But the AUD has
shown no reaction even after a solid performance of Shanghai stocks--up 2% on Monday alone and up
6% in the past week--and brisk economic indicators such as 2Q GDP and July PMI, says Ikeda. It's likely
that the relationship between the Aussie dollar and China's economic growth is receding due to China's
efforts to step out of heavy dependence on construction-related outlays. The AUD/USD is now at 0.9400,
compared with 0.9373 a week ago. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

0626 GMT [Dow Jones] Bunds yields move fractionally higher at the open but still remain within a few
bps of their record all-time low levels as risk aversion trumps stronger economic data. "A robust
economic environment in the US and the continued debate about the timing of the Fed's key rate
reversal are weighing on Bund yields. However, interest in safe government bonds is not diminishing as
the crises in Gaza and Ukraine are leading to increased risk aversion. This situation should not change
significantly today, especially as the data will have little impact on the market," says Helaba. 10-year
Bunds yield 1.152% and the September contract is 4 ticks lower at 148.23. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0616 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank of Japan policy board member Koji Ishida indicates a correlation between
business fixed investment and exports has weakened. "Compared with the past, firms, particularly
exporters, are less intent on business fixed investment aimed at raising their production capabilities (at
home)," Mr. Ishida said at a press conference following a meeting with business leaders in Yamaguichi
prefecture, western Japan. Their investment has been increasingly motivated by those to maintain their
existing facilities. Mr. Ishida adds even if exports were to pick up, exporters are unlikely to ramp up
investment at home. He also said some business leaders there call for the BOJ to stabilize the yen's
exchange rate, signalling that companies are getting less reliant on a weak yen for boosting exports.

0547 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZX-50 closes down 0.4% at 5165.56 led by weakness in large cap stocks
Telecom (TEL.NZ) and Fletcher Building (FBU.NZ), says Hamilton Hindin Greene broker Grant
Williamson. Telecom was down 3.1% at NZ$2.85 after UBS downgraded the company to Sell from
Neutral, saying recent outperformance had left the company 25% above its valuation. He adds that
Fletcher Building (FBU.NZ) fell 1.6% at NZ$9.04. Williamson adds Fonterra Shareholders Fund (FSF.NZ)
ended up 1.2% at NZ$6.07 after the company announced it expected to pay a NZ$0.20-NZ$0.25
dividend per unit vs. a NZ$0.10/unit dividend in 2014. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)
0538 GMT [Dow Jones] Oil-refining margins will likely to remain good in Japan through March 2017
thanks to a government-imposed refining-capacity cut, SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Hidetoshi Shioda

Page104of300©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.says. Gasoline margins have already more than doubled from January to Y15.7 ($0.15) a kiloliter in the
first week of July after closures of three refineries from July 2013 to March 2014. Besides, the
government announced an additional 10% capacity-cut by March 2017 on expectations of even lower
domestic oil demand in line with adoption of energy efficient technologies. (mari.iwata@wsj.com)
