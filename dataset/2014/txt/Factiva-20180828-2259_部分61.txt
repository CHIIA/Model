HEREFORD females sold to $9000 at Injemira Beef Genetics, Book Book, last week as stud
principal Marc Greening, dispersed his horned herd to concentrate on his Poll Hereford operation.
Auctioneer Paul Dooley, Paul Dooley Pty Ltd, Tamworth, sold through the 42 degrees Celsius day to
offload 113 of the 123 females offered, averaging $2097.

Buyers came from five States as the top $9000 donor cow Injemira Dom Pattie G086, by Injemira
Legion E064, with a cracking bull calf at side by Mawarra Yours Truly and unjoined, sold to Sam
Becker, Jarrah Cattle Company, Banana, Queensland.

A long time supporter of the Injemira program, Mr Becker also bought a second cow by Injemira
Advance Z080 and depastured to Mawarra Ameretto for $4000, before securing a spring drop heifer
Injemira Dom Pattie J175 a daughter of the top priced donor cow also for $4000.

Mr Becker said the top lot was an excellent modern Hereford cow not extreme, soft and producing
well with genetics going back to Y085 on the dam side and that sire was "a curve bender".
"The top heifer's mother was the top-priced cow a few years ago at the last Injemira female sale and
her genetics show the strength of pedigree and that they are a proven line," he said.

Mr Becker bought the Dom Pattie J175 heifer to retain all the top-priced donor cow's genetics for his
stud.

Battalion Herefords, "Wattle Dale", Dundee, paid to $6000 for Injemira Pearl F137, a Talbalba
Valuable daughter with a spring-drop calf at foot by Injemira Advance E007.
The team at Battalion also purchased a second cow and calf unit for $3000 and an autumn calving
heifer for $2500.

Karen Arnott, Cascade Poll Hereford stud, Currabubula, paid $7500 for Injemira Ugena J015, a
heifer entering the donor program, by Mawarra Yours Truly and rated by Mr Greening as the "best
horned female ever bred at Injemira".

Ugena J015 was artificially inseminated to Injemira Advance Y203 in June and depastured to
Quamby Plains Gaucho from July to September.
Rockford Pty Limited, "Rockford", Bothwell, Tasmania, purchased two donor cows for $3000 and
$4000, before taking eight spring-drop cow and calf units for $2281, two spring drop heifers at $1000
and $1500, three autumn drop cow and calf units to a top of $4250, averaging $2667, and three
autumn drop heifers averaging $2333.

Long time supporter of the Injemira program John Muraca, "Murpack", Wangaratta, Victoria, had
recently sold a large wing of cull cows and was looking for replacements to join his 250 herd, run on
320 hectares, producing weaners for the February weaner sale in Wangaratta.

autumn drop heifers for $1250 apiece.
"Not many opportunities like this come along to buy some of the best industry producing females for
this money and why wait for February when they would be as dear as poison to buy then anyway,"
he said.
Mr Muraca said Injemira bought his top heifers every year to put into their commercial program, and
also allowed him to be involved in their recent deal supplying heifers to China.
Weslby Park Herefords, Shepparton, Vic, secured two spring-drop PTIC cows and five autumn-drop
heifers for $1679, while R. and C. Pitson, "Carinya", Culcairn, bought seven females, including four
heifers, averaging $1571.

John Cobb, trading as Cranky Bob Pty Ltd, Molong, bought six spring PTIC cows for $1750 and P.R.
McCormack, Tallangatta, Vic, loaded five spring drops at $1755.

Ian Manning, Bathurst paid to $4000 for three spring-calving cows and an autumn-drop heifer, while
Jacinta Pretty, Jindivick, paid to $4500 for three lots.
Rob Cooper, King Island, Tasmania, rounded out the sale securing three autumn calving three in
one units and three autumn calving heifers averaging $1833.
