Initiating coverage on SEEK with an "add" ..

A leading broker initiated coverage on SEEK with an "Add" and a price target of $14.60.

The broker said SEEK offers investors exposure to the growth in online employment advertising and
education services in Australia, China, Southeast Asia and Latin America. It is the world's 4th largest
player in online recruitment by revenues with SEEK's annual revenue exceeding global industry growth
by a considerable margin since 2004.

SEEK is aiming to win a much bigger share of the recruitment market pie by transforming its business
model from one based on advertising to one based on a more sophisticated recruitment service offering
including a national database of potential candidates.

"The planned IPOs of IDP Education and Zhaopin and further consolidation in the Southeast Asian
employment market are potential near term catalysts. Successful IPOs would leave the company debt
free and cashed up" the broker said in the report.

SEK down 6c to $12.86

Initiating Nine Entertainment with an "overweight" ..

A leading broker, saying it is fundamentally a structural bear on the Australian Media Industry, initiated
coverage of Nine Entertainment with an "overweight" rating and a $2.40 per share target. The broker said
it stands out from its peers.

(i) FTA TV is structurally sound and NEC is a FTA TV pure play, which unlike peers has no declining
newspaper/print media burden to carry.

(ii) It is the right time in the cycle - the TV ad market is just returning to positive growth after a two eyar
recession.

(iii)Importantly, NEC is modestly leveraged (1.4x Full year 2015 estimated net debt/EBITDA) which also
sees it well placed for eps accretive bolt on acquisitions, should these arise.

NEC up 2c to $2.17.

Diggers & Drillers
Aurora Oil & Gas Ltd is a "buy"/an "overweight"/a "hold" ..
A leading broker with a "buy" on Aurora Oil & Gas said AUT's December 2013 quarter production of
2.27mmboe pre royalties was 15% ahead of September 2013 qtr and in line with the broker's estimates.

Aurora has also announced it has secured 14,000 net acres in the Eaglebine play, located in East Texas
and is still actively acquiring leases.

The broker said it is forecasting another solid year of production growth for Aurora, reaching 11.3 Mmboe,
a 46% increase on 2013 production). Its valuation remains at $3.70, including 25c per share for Austin
Chalk potential.

*Another leading broker with an "overweight" recommendation and a $3.60 rice target said the strong
December quarter underpins strong growth in 2014. While depressed WTI prices look set to continue into
2014, gas prices have rallied strongly and spot Henry Hub prices are materially higher than the broker's
numbers. The broker expects operating cash flows to overtake capex in late 2014.

*Another leading broker with an "accumulate" on Aurora and a price target of $2.93, down from $3 earlier
said full year production at 7.8mmboe beat the November guidance of 7.4/7.7 mmboe. Full year capital
expenditure of $US494 million was within the company's revised range of $US490/510 million.
Following Aurora's acquisition of a 14,000 net acre operated position in the Eaglebine play in east Texas
where the north eastern eagle Ford shale meets the Woodbine sandstone the broker said, "clearly the
firm now ha larger ambitions than simply being a pure play on the sweet spot of the Eagle Ford .. we
wonder whether Aurora will become another small explorer and producer trying to parlay its good fortune
and success in one play into others".

AUT up 6c to $2.84.

production at 2.5Mwmt of iron ore was 4% below the previous quarter its was 12% ahead of the broker's
estimates. The broker added, "with 18% potential upside to our current target price, we reiterate our Add
recommendation. In our view Mount Gibson's net cash position of around 42c per share, accounting for
41% of its current share price, makes it one of the safest ways to play the iron ore them in the juniors
space".

*Another leading broker lifted its target price from 82c to $1, saying it has incorporated the December
2013 quarter production and sales numbers as well as the recent commodity price revisions.. "We have
also raised our long term iron ore price by 13% to $US89/t cfr and decreased the $A to 89c in 204 and
88c in 2015 from 93c and 89c. With iron ore the drive of MGX's earnings NPV lifts 22% to $A1.01 per
share".

Page26of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.relatively small provide us more reasons to be positive on the stock.. in our view falling iron ore prices
and potential for M&A represent the biggest risks".

MGX down 5.5c to 96.5c.
