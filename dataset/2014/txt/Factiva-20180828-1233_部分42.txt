Global dairy cooperative Fonterra will invest $550 million in Chinese dairy giant Beingmate to increase
access to the billion dollar infant milk market.
The deal includes a 20 per cent share of the Chinese company and joint ownership of Fonterra's
state-of-the-art milk powder facility in Gippsland, south-west Victoria.

Under the proposed agreement Beingmate will own a majority share in the Gippsland facility but
operations will continue to be run by Fonterra.
Managing director of Fonterra Australia, Judith Swales, says the value of the infant milk formula market in
China will nearly double in the next three years.
"The market is $18 billion all up and we see that growing to $33 billion by 2017 so that's significant.
"This is a game changer for the dairy industry in Australia and Fonterra given that they [Beingmate] are
the market leader in infant formula in China with a 10 per cent market share."
Fonterra will concede a 51 per cent stake of its Gippsland processing factory to give Beingmate better
access to safety protocols into the Chinese market.
In return Ms Swales says Fonterra will get unprecedented reach in China's infant formula market.
"For our infant formula brand, that is manufactured in New Zealand, it gives us access to 80 thousand
outlets.

"It also creates a demand pipeline for products from our Darnum facility in Gippsland."

The partnership will increase investment in Fonterra's manufacturing facilities in New Zealand and Europe
and increase the volume of the company's products exported to China.
Fonterra's proposed deal needs approval from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).
