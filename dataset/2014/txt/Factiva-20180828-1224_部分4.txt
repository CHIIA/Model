2357 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter nudges up its price target on National Australia Bank (NAB.AU) to
A$37.50/share from A$37.20 on news the lender plans to sell a minority stake ahead of a full exit from its
South Dakota-based subsidiary. The Great Western unit's book value implies some US$700 million in
tier 1 capital will be freed up for lending at a higher return on equity or possibly returned to shareholders,
Bell Potter says. It anticipates a U.S. IPO will value Great Western at US$1.4 billion, or 1 times book
value. Its buy recommendation is retained. NAB last traded at A$35.20. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2353 GMT [Dow Jones] Spot USD/KRW is likely to trade with a bullish tone Monday as USD sentiment
gets a lift from stronger-than-expected U.S. August ISM Chicago PMI and final University of Michigan
U.S. August consumer sentiment index data. But KRW sentiment was boosted Friday by 3.4% on-year
rise in South Korea July industrial production index (versus forecast +2.7%). KRW vulnerable to 0000
GMT South Korea August trade balance, 0000 GMT HSBC South Korea August manufacturing PMI data.
Dow Jones technical analysis shows USD/KRW daily price chart still negative-biased as five- & 15-day
moving averages declining, although the slow stochastic indicator is at oversold levels. Resistance is at
1,016.8 (Friday's high); breach would expose upside to 1,022.3 (base of daily Ichimoku cloud), then
1,023.0 (Aug. 25 high, near middle 20-day Bollinger Band). Support at 1,013.0 (Thursday's low), then at
1,008.9 (July 4 swing low, near lower 20-day two-standard deviation Bollinger Band). Spot USD/KRW
closed at 1,014.0 in late Asia on Friday.(jerry.tan@wsj.com)

2348 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian economy likely stagnated in the second quarter, said J.P.
Morgan's chief economist in Australia, Stephen Walters. Partial GDP data on company profits,
inventories and net exports to be publish Monday and Tuesday ahead of the GDP release on
Wednesday will further shape JPM's forecast, but Walters say he can't rule out a negative print. This
"would spook" those reluctant to cut interest rates at the Reserve Bank of Australia, he added.

2344 GMT [Dow Jones] Offshore accounts at 5 foreign brokerages place net buy orders for 1 million
Japanese shares overnight, according to traders. The net buying may be positive for the market at the
open, although the yen value basis of the figures is unknown. Buy orders total 6 million shares, with sell
orders amounting to 5 million shares. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

2341 GMT [Dow Jones] New Zealand's terms of trade surprised by eking out another small increase in
2Q, maintaining its position at a four decade high, says Westpac economist Michael Gordon: The "results
don't alter the broader picture for the terms of trade." Gordon adds the greater share in the fall in dairy
prices will be captured by product that is shipped during the September and December quarters: "We
expect the terms of trade to fall by around 10% over the next year, though it should be noted that we see
the recent softening in export prices as a temporary factor, as Chinese buyers work through a build-up of
inventories." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer)

2335 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Activity across Australia's manufacturing sector contracted in August as the
persistent strength of the Australian dollar put a dent in confidence. The Australian Industry Group's
Performance of manufacturing Index fell 3.4 points to 47.3 in August from July, with a drop below a
reading of 50 points indicating a decline in activity. Only the large food, beverages & tobacco and the
smaller wood and paper products subsectors expanded in August. A decline in new orders during the

2326 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan cuts Transfield Services (TSE.AU) to Underweight from Neutral,
saying earnings momentum has pushed the shares too hard in light of gearing risks. "TSE has done well
to achieve cost out and structural change through FY14. But, we believe the share price is not reflecting
the challenges in TSE's end markets and risks relating to TSE's high gearing," the broker says.
Degearing revealed in the company's FY14 result was lower than the broker expected. Operating cash
flow was 75% below expectations while net debt of A$533.7 million was down only A$8.8 million over
12 months. That leaves gearing elevated at 41.4%. The broker says further cost reductions in Australia
and New Zealand are limited and competition could increase in Australia, eroding margins, as
engineering activity slows. Lifts price target to A$1.35 from A$1.13, versus A$1.75 last trade.

2325 GMT [Dow Jones] The steep fall in iron-ore prices since January led Grange Resources (GRR.AU)
not to pay an interim dividend, and J.P.Morgan doesn't think payouts will resume later this year either.
That is despite Grange's cash balance remaining healthy at A$109 million at end-June, representing
around 40% of the company's current share price. J.P.Morgan had expected to declare a 1 cent/share
dividend alongside its 1H results. The broker rates Grange, which reported A$50 million underlying
Ebitda for the six months through June, at overweight with 40% upside to its last traded share price of
A$0.165. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2317 GMT [Dow Jones] -- The USD/JPY likely will be stuck in the 103.60-104.50 range in Asia trade, with
investors unable to move ahead of a slew of events later this week such as the European Central Bank's
policy meeting and U.S. jobs data, says IG Securities market analyst Junichi Ishikawa. China PMI data
are in focus, especially on how the AUD/USD will affect the USD/JPY. But "That will be short-lived," if
any, he says. The pair is at 104.13 against 104.08 in New York late Friday. Mr. Ishikawa also says
investors need to be cautious about downside risk of the EUR/USD to break below 1.3100, but the pair
may be vulnerable to short-covering due to a lack of fresh cues during Asia trade. The pair is tipped in a
1.3100-1.3200 range and is now at 1.3134. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

2320 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan initiates Nine Entertainment (NEC.AU) at Overweight with a A$2.42
target price. The broker favors Nine's strong FY15 TV revenue share growth outlook, forecasting a 0.8%
increase to 39.5%, assisted by the acquisition of the Perth/Adelaide Metro TV stations and the positive
effect of the Cricket World Cup. It also expects the company to be well placed in any future media
consolidation. NEC last A$2.06. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2313 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Although Virgin Australia's (VAH.AU) financial position gradually should
improve, and it could reach break-even by FY17, its share price is being kept artificially high by its three
big airline backers, says J.P. Morgan, which keeps an underperform recommendation on the stock.
State-backed Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Etihad own around 70% of the Australian carrier.
Its moves to snatch market share from Qantas (QAN.AU) are working, but expensive. "While we believe
that the transformation of Virgin Australia into a full service domestic carrier and its low-cost carrier in
Tigerair will pay off in the medium term, we believe it may end up costing more to do so," the broker
says. It lifts its share-price target to A$0.35 from A$0.30 vs. the shares' last trade of A$0.415.

2302 GMT [Dow Jones] -- Credit Suisse lowers its forecast for Sandfire Resources' (SFR.AU) FY15 net
profit by 13 million Australian dollars (US$12.1 million) after the Australian copper miner outlines higher
exploration and corporate expenses. It adds that the profit reduction would have been A$9 million
deeper were it not for a concentrate shipment that took place a few days after FY14 ended, even though
production had occurred earlier. Credit Suisse expects Sandfire to report net income of A$76.5 million in
FY15, with a full-year dividend of 16.28 cents a share. That came after Sandfire unveiled a maiden
dividend of 10 cents/share alongside its FY14 results. The broker rates Sandfire at underperform with a
A$5.72 price target. SFR last traded at A$6.34. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
