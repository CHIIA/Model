TAKEOVERS ANOTHER hurdle has been cleared by Chinese steelmaker Baosteel and Australian
rail operator Aurizon in their $1.42 billion bid for Aquila Resources.

The deal now solely requires approval from Aquila shareholders after the Foreign Investment
Review Board granted its approval yesterday. State owned-Baosteel was always seen as a likely
mover on the iron ore and coal market given it had amassed a 19.7 per cent stake in Aquila in
2009.

Aquila said shareholders should take no action until the company’s independent board
sub-committee presents a recommendation.
The suitors plan to kick-start the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara Iron Ore Project if their bid
succeeds. Aquila holds a 50 per cent stake in the project.

Aurizon chief Lance Hockridge and Baosteel chairman Zhihao Dai welcomed the FIRB decision.

“The offer is the first step in a potential pathway to co-investment in resources and greenfield
infrastructure, representing a great opportunity to co-develop world-class rail and port infrastructure
in Australia,” Mr Hockridge said.Aquila shares closed 1c higher at $3.52.
