A cross-border team from global legal practice Norton Rose Fulbright has advised China's largest
privately owned corporation, Fosun International Limited (Fosun), on the $489 million takeover of ASX
listed ROC Oil Company Limited (ROC). The deal, announced on 4 August 2014, involved lawyers from
our Melbourne, Shanghai, Perth, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jakarta and London offices. ROC is an oil
company with assets across China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Australia and the UK. Fosun s takeover bid for
ROC has trumped a competing merger bid with another ASX-listed oil and gas company, Horizon
Energy. The merger was scheduled to be voted on by Horizon shareholders on August 7 and was due to
be completed on August 14.
