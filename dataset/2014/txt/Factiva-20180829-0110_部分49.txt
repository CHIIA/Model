An apartment boom is taking shape in Sydney's inner city.

According to the City of Sydney, just 254 dwellings were built in the CBD between 2007-2012.

But developer group Urban Taskforce chief executive Chris Johnson estimates about 3000 will be
built in the five years to 2017.

"People want to be close to where the work is and most of the work is in the CBD," he said.
Last Saturday, there were 120 apartments offered for sale in the second release of dwellings in what
will soon by Sydney's tallest residential tower, the $680 million Greenland Centre on Bathurst Street.
All but 10 sold on the day.

"I am sick of the bus, of cars and of travelling," said Mosman resident Rachel Vo, who paid
$1,865,000 for an off-the-plan two-bedroom apartment to live with her boyfriend Damien Ciupak. "I
have never lived in a city before but it is close to everywhere I want to go, getting to the north is easy
and so is getting to the east."
The 470-apartment development is being delivered by China's state-owned Greenland Group,
which is behind the Zifeng Tower in Nanjing, China, which is the world's eighth-tallest building.
The group also has plans for a super-scraper in Wuhan, China, which will become the world's
third-tallest building.
In the first release of the Greenland Centre more than $275 million worth of units were sold. The
second release has brought in another $140 million and the June third release will include nine
penthouses being offered, some for more than $10 million. Construction of the tower is set to start at
the end of June with a completion date at the end of 2017.
CBRE managing director David Milton said more people were opting to buy, instead of rent, in the
city.

In the latest Greenland release 62 per cent of the apartments were snapped up by owner-occupiers
"The shift [to vertical living] has already occurred, what's happening now is more people are adopting
it," he said. "In the 2011 census 25.8 per cent of people in metro Sydney were living in apartments."

With 70 per cent of new approvals being apartments, Mr Johnson expects Sydney will become a
"50-50 city" by 2013, with half of the population living in houses and the other half apartments.
Fife Capital is building York & George, a 200-apartment development on George Street, Crown
Group has plans for a 220-apartment development on Clarence Street and developer Ceerose is set
to finish work on the Eliza Building on Hyde Park at the end of the month. All but two of the 19 luxury
apartments have found buyers with the penthouse expected to sell for more than $15 million.
