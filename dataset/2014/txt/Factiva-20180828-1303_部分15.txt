0821 - A jump in Australia's unemployment rate to 6.4% was a "very big surprise" to Barclays, which had
expected a smaller uptick to 6.1% in July from 6% in the previous month. "This large an increase in
unemployment is unusual and is normally seen when the economy is either slowing very sharply or in
outright recession," Barclays said. "However, it appears to us to be overstated." It notes a third of the rise
was due to the rotation of new people into the survey sample. Also, the spike in unemployment is out of
line with other economic indicators. "Similar spikes in the past have been associated with large falls in
employment, very weak business conditions, low consumer sentiment, and falling job ads, which is not
the case now," Barclays said. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

0829 - J.P. Morgan keeps its Overweight rating on Crown (CWN.AU), but trims its target price from
A$16.65 to A$16.35 after lowering its earnings forecasts following Melco Crown (MPEL) results last
week. The broker expects continued weakness in VIP trends for the remainder of the year, a moderation
of go-forward mass-market growth assumptions, and labor expense related operating-expense
increases, with corresponding effects on EBITDA margins. CWN last A$15.18. (david.rogers@wsj.com;

0846 - Credit Suisse upgrades REA Group (REA.AU) to Outperform from Neutral after its shares fell
6.9% on Friday on profit taking after a strong FY14 report. The broker lifts its target price to A$49.00 from
A$47.50, saying REA still has a significant opportunity to grow its share of overall real-estate
transaction spending, potentially supporting earnings growth for a number of years. REA last A$42.78.

0942 - Chinese power plants and increased industrial power demand led to stronger restocking interest
of thermal coal, says Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in a note. Year-to-date industrial power
consumption in China is 831.4kWh -- up almost 5% on year. The power sector accounts for 32% of
China's total power demand. Newcastle coal futures, Asian benchmark, consolidated gains on Friday,
finishing the week 2.5% higher. (Mari.iwata@wsj.com)

0944 - The big news from last week is that Australia's unemployment rate now is at a 12-year high of
6.4%, having unexpectedly spiked in last week's employment report for July, says Stephen Walters, chief
economist at JPMorgan. He adds that while there were plenty of statistical bogeys that might have been
at play, JPM takes the government officials behind the data at their word when they say these had only a
marginal influence on the data. "It seems, therefore, that slack is still accumulating," in the job market,
Mr. Walters adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0947 - While the Reserve Bank of Australia's quarterly policy statement Monday had a more dovish tone,
with growth forecasts revised down, policy makers don't appear to regard the changes as material
enough to justify another rate cut, says Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. He adds that the
improvement in housing indicators, business confidence and forward-looking labor market indicators
tells us that rates are low enough, but with unemployment still rising, the Australian dollar still strong and
uncertainty remaining about the speed of the mining investment slowdown, it is hard to justify a hike
either, Mr. Oliver adds. The first rate increase is unlikely to come until after the Fed starts to raise rates.

0950 - Surprise surprise, Treasury Wine Estates (TWE.AU) has not one but two private-equity takeover
bids. After KKR and Rhone Capital raised KKR's initial A$4.70 a share cash offer to A$5.20 last week,

Page43of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.TWE says it subsequently received an additional cash offer at A$5.20 from a global private-equity
investor who requested its identity remain confidential for now. The competing bidder has been granted
due diligence alongside the KKR and Rhone Capital consortium. For months, analysts doubted KKR
would follow through with its initial bid. Now they will have to allow for the possibility of an even higher bid
emerging. TWE shares are therefore likely to jump to a premium to the existing A$5.20 bids when trade
resumes at 0100 GMT today. TWE last A$5.13. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0955 - Australia's S&P/ASX 200 is expected to open up about 0.7% after the S&P 500 surged 1.2% on
Friday following news that Russia said it ended military exercises near Ukraine and will "continue to
make all efforts for a very fast de-escalation on tensions" with Ukraine. However, follow-through buying
may be lacking as investors await further stabilization in global markets. "Overall, I still believe the
S&P/ASX 200 will retrace back towards 5350," says marketmatters.com.au principal Shawn Hickman.
"My view remains that the majority of the weakness will come from the banking sector which people are
overweight hence, pullbacks can be sharp." Focus otherwise will be on earnings reports from JB Hi-Fi
(JBH.AU) and Bendigo Bank (BEN.AU), as well as news of another takeover bid for Treasury Wine
Estates (TWE.AU) Index last 5435.5. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

1007 - The Russian import ban is insignificant in terms of economic impact to Australia and all but
irrelevant to New Zealand, says TD Securities Head of Asia Pacific Annette Beacher. "We suspected that
Australian and New Zealand trade with Russia was insignificant, but how small even surprised us." Last
week Russia ordered a full ban of imports of meat, dairy and vegetables and fruit from Australia,
Canada, Europe, the U.S. and Norway and there was some feeling this could benefit NZ. "It has taken
years for New Zealand to build up significant trade relations with China, so it is highly unlikely that
produce would merely be re-routed to Russia. Furthermore, given the close relations between Australia
and New Zealand Australia's stance on Russia is likely to be strongly supported by New Zealand," says
Beacher. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com;Twitter: @lucy_craymer james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

1009 - J.P. Morgan identifies six malls it reckons Westfield (WFD.AU) will sell to focus on more lucrative
developments, together worth US$1.18 billion. These include Mainplace in Los Angeles; Vancouver in
Washington; Connecticut Post and Meriden in Connecticut; and Fox Valley and Hawthorn in Illinois. The
broker also expects Westfield to earn around US$710 million in development fees by selling 50% stakes
in current projects, including the retail wing of the World Trade Centre, under construction in New York,
and the Century City mall development in Los Angeles. "Westfield has a high quality portfolio, which will
continue to improve through a US$11.8 billion premium mall development pipeline," J.P. Morgan says. It
however stays "neutral" on the stock, given a recent price rally. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
1013 - Credit Suisse lifts its 2015-17 earnings forecasts for Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AU) by
around 20%, citing expectations of higher received prices and stronger shipping volumes. The broker
now estimates underlying net profit of US$2.71 billion in FY14--an increase of 6% on its prior
forecast--followed by US$1.51 billion in FY15, US$1.42 billion in FY16 and US$1.83 billion in FY17.
"We now see that FMG's 4Q received price was adversely affected by provisional pricing, so the
underlying discount was less severe than it initially seemed," Credit Suisse says. "Accordingly, we
moderate our forecast quality discount," it says, adding that FMG's FY15 155-160 million ton shipping
guidance also appears "readily achievable." It keeps a neutral rating on the stock and a target of A$5.00.
FMG trades up 1.8% at A$4.64. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)
1019 - The U.S. dollar has made an attempted break higher across the board and if the U.S. dollar index
manages to gain a stronger foothold at higher levels it should mean the Australian dollar renews and
maintains negative momentum, says Emma Lawson, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank. She
adds that if market volatility slips lower again, the Australian dollar is likely to move into a US$0.9400 -
US$0.9200 range. AUD/USD is now trading at US$0.9276. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter
@JamesGlynnWSJ)

1023 - Australian second-quarter wage price index will be released on Wednesday and RBC Capital
Markets expects another quarter of modest wage growth of 0.7%, which would see the annual rate
remain at 2.6%. Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC said annual wage growth has been
running at this subdued pace for the last 12 months and largely underpins the central bank's expectation
that core inflation will remain comfortably within the 2% to 3% target range even with a lower Australian
dollar. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
1028 - Goldman Sachs thinks Australia's largest telecommunications company Telstra (TLS.AU) is likely
to provide an update on its capital deployment options when it reports full-year results on Thursday. With
around A$4.5 billion in excess free cash flow, Telstra must weigh up M&A opportunities against boosting
returns for shareholders via a buyback of its own stock. "We estimate a A$1 billion buyback would be
around 0.5-1.0% earnings-per-share accretive," says Goldman, which rates the stock Neutral with a
A$4.80 price target. The broker expects Telstra to declare a 10% rise in net profit to A$3.95 billion, and

Page44of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.forecasts a final dividend of A$0.15, up from A$0.14 in the prior corresponding period. TLS last trades at
A$5.43. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1030 - Mount Gibson Iron Ltd.'s (MGX.AU) fat cash balance of around A$520 million will allow the miner
to sustain its iron-ore operations through a price trough, but that cash pile will subsequently erode over
the next couple of years, says Credit Suisse. "We estimate that positive cash flow from Extension Hill will
not make up for negative cash flow from Koolan Island," it says in a note. "On the positive side, cash
generation should resume in FY17." Its analysts meanwhile think MGX's Shine project won't be viable as
average iron-ore prices slip and will be deferred. Credit Suisse has a neutral rating on stock with a
A$0.80 target. MGX trades up 1.4% at A$0.75. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

1039 - FXCM currency analyst, David de Ferranti, is bearish on the Aussie this week as it extends
declines on the back of broad-based risk aversion and disappointing domestic data last week. he says
that if tensions in the Middle East or Ukraine escalate further, the Aussie could face further weakness in
the short term. crucially, the Australian dollar is drawing closer to the US$0.9200 handle and if broken, it
could set the stage for a sustained decline to the psychologically significant 0.9000 handle. Pair now
US$0.9279. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

1041 - Credit Suisse estimates Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) can afford to return 12% of its market cap by the end
of 2016, assuming the company can tolerate US$20 billion of net debt and iron-ore prices steady
around US$90/ton. "Even if iron ore prices fell to US$80/ton, if we are right and Rio can tolerate US$20
billion of net debt, then they could still start a shareholder return program returning 8% of market cap by
end 2016," the bank says in a note. Of course, higher iron-ore prices could also result in better-than
expected returns. Credit Suisse thinks Rio could return more than 20% of its market cap if the
commodity's price rebounded to US$110/ton-plus. RIO trades up 0.6% in Sydney at A$66.84.
(rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)
1044 - Early signs of a bottom in major equity markets include the rapid deterioration in investor
sentiment, which occurred last week despite stronger-than-expected U.S. earnings reports, improving
global manufacturing indicators and the lack of any upward spike in U.S. bond rates, according to AMP
Capital. "While the correction wasn't surprising, I am amazed by the speed which investor sentiment has
turned sour (which is) a good sign from a contrarian point of view," says AMP Capital's head of dynamic
asset allocation, Nader Naeimi. "While the U.S. short-term interest rates have moved higher in recent
weeks, the move so far has been marginal...interest rates can move sharply higher as expectations for a
rise in Fed funds rate gathers steam perhaps triggered by rising inflation, but we are not there yet."
(david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

1103 - Morgans hikes its price target for Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) as it lifts earnings estimates on
higher-than-anticipated near-term prices, rising volumes and lower costs. The broker, which reiterates its
"add" rating, bumps its target to A$92 a share from A$84 previously. It lifts its FY14 Ebitda forecast 8.0%
to US$20.54 billion and its underlying net profit forecast 2.6% to US$10.30 billion. Higher iron-ore
production will bolster earnings in 2014-15, it says. It also expects aluminum earnings to expand over the
longer run on lower costs and the ramp up of the Kitimat modernization project in Canada. RIO trades up
0.8% in Sydney at A$66.98. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

1115 - Macquarie Equities strategists are seeing some positive signs in the early stages of the Aussie
earnings period. "Importantly, guidance for most companies has been maintained with relatively few
companies providing profit warnings leading to this reporting season," the broker says. "Macquarie's
FY15 bottom up EPS growth forecast for All Companies ex-Resources also remains largely unchanged
at +11.9% after the first week of reporting season." Index last up 0.6% at 5468.7.
(david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

1121 - Macquarie says Amcor's (AMC.AU) diversified geographical footprint helps to insulate it against
bubbling issues in Russia and Ukraine. Last week, Russia banned imports of beef, pork, poultry, fish,
fruit, vegetables, and dairy products from the U.S., Canada, the E.U., Norway and Australia. Russia's
move was a radical response to penalties imposed on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. "We understand
the Russian import ban is on fresh food and not processed food from Europe," Macquarie says. That
provides comfort for investors in Amcor, which mainly packages processed food in Europe. Still, there
may be some negative impact on products like cheese. "Amcor also has a Russian tobacco packaging
and flexible business, which we estimate to be 3-4% of sales, but this serves Russian domestic demand
so we see no real change here," says Macquarie, which rates Amcor at outperform with a A$10.95 price
target. AMC last traded at A$10.12. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1128 - An almost 10% rise in Bendigo & Adelaide Bank's (BEN.AU) full-year cash earnings was roughly
3% ahead of consensus expectations, driven by strong revenue growth and despite

Page45of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.higher-than-anticipated costs, says Omkar Joshi, investment manager at Watermark Funds
Management. The regional bank's bad debt charge for the year through June was marginally higher than
the consensus expectation, although Bendigo topped up provisioning in the second half of the year, Joshi
says. At the same time, the final dividend is also ahead of expectations, he says. BEN is trading up 1.6%
at A$12.38. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
1131 - Macquarie reiterates its Neutral rating and A$42.00 target price on REA Group (REA.AU), based
on its view that a strong growth outlook is already factored into the share price. It says the market
appeared to be slightly disappointed with 2H margins, but underlying earnings were solid. REA is up
3.2% at A$44.19. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)
1133 - Macquarie says copper fundamentals are poised to weaken, as the adjusted refined market
balance swings to a surplus of 229,000 tons in the six months through December from a 1H deficit of
166,000 tons. Driving this turnaround are higher supply, softer demand in regions including China and
Europe, and continued outflows from bonded warehouses in the aftermath of the investigation into a
suspected loans fraud in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. At the close of open-outcry trading on Friday,
LME three-month copper fell 0.1% on the day at US$6,994/ton. (david.winning@wsj.com;
@dwinningWSJ)

1135 - Macquarie sticks with an outperform call on Bendigo & Adelaide Bank (BEN.AU) on the back of
strong full-year earnings that were driven by a reasonable margin improvement despite slightly elevated
costs. The brokerage says that pleasingly Bendigo's bad and doubtful debts for the year through June
were lower that it had forecast. An impairment charge of A$82 million for FY14 was below Macquarie's
expectation for A$85 million. Macquarie has a price target for the bank of A$12.52/share. BEN is up
1.8% at A$12.40, outpacing the wider market. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

1137 - Last week's unexpected spike in Australian unemployment to 6.4% in July from 6.0% in June and
the downgraded GDP forecasts in the latest central bank policy statement has seen rate cut expectations
ratchet back higher to 66% from 23%, says NAB in a note to clients. It adds that in an environment where
the Australian dollar is moving lower, albeit still too high for the central bank's comfort, the mostly likely
policy course remains a lengthy period of inaction, with any move in the next six months or more likely to
be further easing. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

1140 - The Australian dollar's break to fresh two-month lows last week will continue to provide a
convenient opportunity to buy for many of the real money/corporate names who have been patiently
waiting for such a move, says Will Richardson, strategist at Macquarie Bank. He adds expect support in
the US$0.9200 to US$0.9180 area. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)
1205 - Citi cuts Crown Resorts (CWN.AU) to Neutral from Buy after lowering its Macau earnings
forecasts following a slowdown in mass revenue growth in July. "We now forecast Macau gross gaming
revenue growth of 4% in 2014 from 11% previously," the broker says. "While the slowdown in mass
growth is unexplained, we have taken a conservative outlook for the remainder of the year with 13%
growth for 2H 2014 forecast, until new casino capacity is opened in 2015. Despite Melco Crown
Entertainment (the company's Macau joint venture) trading at more attractive levels, our conservative
Macau forecasts now imply further earnings downside to consensus." Target price falls to A$16.00 from
A$17.25. Crown is trading 0.6% lower at A$14.66. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)
1211 - UBS upgrades REA Group (REA.AU) to Buy from Neutral after incorporating 4%-8% upgrades to
FY15-FY18 EPS estimates to factor in market-based pricing initiatives, new product initiatives and the
acquisition of a 17.2% stake in IProperty Group. "Revised estimates see REA deliver a 27%, 26% and
19% NPAT, EBITDA and Revenue compound annual growth rate in FY14-FY17 with REA's share of
property advertising spend in Australia lifting from about 40% in FY14 towards 60% by end-FY17," the
broker says. REA is up 4% at A$44.51. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

1324 - Shares in PanAust Ltd. (PNA.AU) should head higher now that its secured Glencore PLC's Frieda
River project, says UBS. PanAust says the deal is expected to close on August 25 after conditions on the
transaction were met. "We subsequently update our PanAust valuation to include a 30% risk-adjusted
value of US$240 million or A$0.41/share for PanAust's 80% interest" in the project, UBS says. It ups its
target to A$2.75 from A$2.47 and keeps a buy rating on the stock. "We believe that either the PanAust
share price, or the GRAM proposal [to takeover the miner], will soon begin to factor in the improved
global sentiment towards copper and the recognition of the Frieda River asset ownership," says UBS.
Also expects copper production at miner's Phu Kham site to rise. PNA up 1.1% at A$2.295.

Page46of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.1334 - Weak job numbers from Australia last week sparked talk that the Reserve Bank of Australia may
cut rates. But Paul Bloxham, HSBC's economist in Sydney, says signs of a housing bubble are likely to
keep it on hold. While unemployment climbed in July to the highest in 12 years, housing prices have
risen 16% in the past two years, HSBC says. "The bar for another RBA rate cut remains very high while
the housing market is continuing to boom," says Bloxham. The RBA could cut rates to support growth,
but "the cost of this could be excessive risk-taking in the housing market which could eventually threaten
financial stability." (wayne.arnold@wsj.com)
1344 - REA Group's (REA.AU) full-year results were broadly in line with consensus market expectations
but contained no positive surprises, which Morgan Stanley says it had anticipated after the company's
earnings in past years topped expectations. Still, despite being disappointed, the brokerage says an
accelerating earnings trend at the online real estate website operator supports its positive view of the
company. It has an overweight stance. REA shares are up 5.7% at A$45.22, outperforming the broader
market. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
1351 - Australian interest rates will need to remain supportive as the economy transitions from mining to
non-mining, says Citibank, Australia chief economist Paul Brennan. The RBA's period of interest rate
stability is in large part governed by a wait for a stronger U.S. dollar and lower Australian dollar, which
would encourage non-mining businesses to re-engage and this in turn would benefit employment and
therefore consumer spending, he adds. "This suggests the cash rate is going nowhere at least until when
the Fed signals it is close to raising rates. And the return to more normal interest rate levels could be a
slow process," Brennan says. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

1352 - Investors in WorleyParson's (WOR.AU) have a mixed signal from recent earnings results from
offshore peers Amec (AMEC.LN) and Foster Wheeler (FWLT). Amec's first-half revenue and EPS were
both below consensus expectations, and signs of a slowdown across oil and gas markets is negative for
WorleyParson, says Deutsche Bank. Offsetting that to some extent, Foster Wheeler's strong
second-quarter performance and the outlook for its engineering and construction division is positive for
WorleyParson, the brokerage says. It has a buy recommendation on WOR and A$19.71/share target.
WOR shares are up 0.1% at A$16.97. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

1436 - The Aussie/yen cross reaches a two-day high of 94.86 this morning, extending its rebound from
Friday's two-and-a-half month low of 93.88 (near the 200-day moving average), as Tokyo stocks
advance strongly on reports of easing tensions in Ukraine and speculation that Japan's Government
Pension Investment Fund could raise its domestic stock holding to 20% from the current 12%. Japan's
Nikkei Stock Average was recently up 2.13% at 15,093.7. Further upside in the Aussie/yen cross may
encounter resistance at the psychological 95.00 line which roughly matches the 50% Fibonacci
correction of the 96.17-93.88 July 24-Aug. 8 decline; and then at 95.29 (61.8% Fibonacci correction
which is now near the 100-day moving average). Spot AUD/JPY was recently at 94.81.
