*CCL: CCL to now include major writedown of assets on Ardmona in result

Coca-Cola Amatil announced its disappointment in the Federal Government's decision not to invest $25
million as a one off grant for SPC Ardmona, the last remaining major fruit and vegetable processor in
Australia. The Federal Government decision also means a potential $25 million grant from the Victorian
that was conditional on a positive Fed decision will also no longer be forthcoming.
CCL had committed a further investment of more than $90 million to support the government contribution.
CCL Group MD Terry David said the government decision is disappointing in light of the fact that SPC
Ardmona had presented a solid business case to both the Fed and Victorian governments for a one off
co-investment of $25 million each with CCL committing to a significant and much greater investment of
more than $90 million. This was to be invested in best in class technology for both new product
development and efficiency gains, utilising clean, green Australian grown fruit and vegetables.

CCL will now need to write down its assets including brands and goodwill, to be included in CCL's 2013

*DJS/MYR: Received a proposal from Myer in Oct 2013 that was rejected

David Jones Ltd responding to various media commentary following a speculative article in "Street Talk" in
the Fin Review that Myer could approach David Jones in respect of a union by way of an all scrip deal at a
ratio of 1.4 Myer shares for every David Jones shares, David Jones is not currently in discussion with Myer
in relation to any such proposal.

David Jones was previously approached by Myer on October 28 2013 offering 1.06 shares in Myer for
each David Jones shares. The Board formed the view that the potential transaction did not have
sufficient merit for David Jones shareholders to warrant engaging in discussions.
Also the execution and implementation of any such transaction would have substantial commercial,
market, business and regulatory risks including the ACCC review process and would involve the diversion
of company resources over a lengthy period with great uncertainty as to the final outcome and the
potential to result in diminution of value of the David Jones business. (Jan 30, 8 pm)
