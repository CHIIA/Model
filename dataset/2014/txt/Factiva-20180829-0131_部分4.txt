Sydney - Tuesday - February 18: (RWE Australian Business News) - IProperty Group Ltd (ASX:IPP),
"the owner of Asia's No 1 network of property portal sites under the iProperty brand", today announced
a net profit of $1.71m in the year ended December 31 2013, compared with a loss of $2.94m for 2012.

Revenues rose 23pc to $19.05m from $15.46m.

EBITDA was $2.01m, against a loss of $2.89m.

Basic earnings per share were 0.94c, against a loss of 1.67c.
IProperty Group does not propose to pay a dividend for this reporting period (nil in 2012).

The combination of strong revenue growth, tight management of operating expenditure and the one-off
gain on the sale of the investment in iCar Asia resulted in the group reporting its first net profit.

Revenue in the second half of 2013 was up 49pc versus the first half of 2013 and 44pc on the
corresponding period in 2012 from continuing operations, showing a strong growth trend through the
second half of the year and into 2014.
This significant growth in revenue in the second half also meant the group had positive operating cash
flow for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2013.

*****

The Malaysia business, "iProperty.com.my", continues to dominate its market and recorded half-on-half
revenue growth of 67pc off the back of a continued uplift in agent depth revenue, strong developer
display revenue and an improvement in revenue from events.

Average revenue per agent (ARPA) doubled over the course of 2013, with continued improvement in
yield expected to continue.
The Hong Kong business achieved revenue growth of 81pc for 2013, including 51pc half-on-half
growth.

This strong result was achieved despite continued cooling measures from government and now clearly
positions "GoHome.com.hk" as the number 1 property portal in Hong Kong.

In Indonesia "Rumah123.com" extended its leadership position in the market and grew revenue 29pc
over 2013, even while continuing to primarily focus on the growth of its key operating metrics.
In 2013 the number of licensed real estate agents paying to list on the site grew by 42pc, the number of
developer customers grew 66pc and unique visitors to the website peaked at over 1.2m per month.

A focus on cost reduction in the Singapore business delivered operating margins in line with 2012
despite significant cooling measures introduced by the government and a highly competitive operating
environment.
