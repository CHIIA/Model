Relief rally across Asian markets following a bounce in the US, with our market now focussed on the profit
reports.

"Intra day support is at 5430, resistance is at 5470. I will call it up 35"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "There were a lot of interesting moves across equities,
industries and commodities last week.

"The DAX had broken its uptrend around June 23, with the 10,000 level the key level it had to break and
hold. Over the last week the 9600 key level and the 9200 level were broken. Long term support at 9000
held - it was tested but closed above it. The DAX is in a very aggressive downtrend. I expect a bounce this
week, expect it to head back up to 9400, probably its new resistance.

"The Shanghai Market is going against everyone else. 2070 was a critical level of resistance. On July 22 it
broke that and is aggressively higher, bridging numerous levels of resistance. It topped out at 2200 where
there has been a bit of profit taking and consolidating. It has dropped 30 points off its highs. It is a short
tem bearish chart for China. The medium term is probably neutral. We need to see 2200/2300 broken.
2190 remains good support.
"Gold has been bid up over the last week, it was in downtrend prior to last week's headlines. It is now
looking more short term neutral. It has broken back above the 20 day moving average at $1310. Key
support is at $1300. If it fails to hold gold may head back down to $2900 again. If the trend holds it could
head up to $1320 and $1330. It is short term neutral.

Page48of269©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.*The S&P chart broke down around July 30, but not as aggressively as the German chart. It has seen the
20 day and 30 day moving average broken probably for the first time since April this year.

"It has held above the 100 day moving average. 1920 looks to be good support. I would probably expect a
bit of a bounce here given the RSI has found support at this level. The next level of resistance is 1950
followed by 1958. The bulls for the week will want to see the S&P close above 1958.

"The XJO has had a big sell off that began on August 1. It is interesting to note we have broken the 20
day, 50 day and 100 day levels of support as of Friday. The long term uptrend looks as if it is still holding -
if we draw a line from the August 2012 low that uptrend just remains in tact at the moment.

"The market is sitting not far off the base of that trendline. We wouldn't want to see 5400 broken for the
week. If we do see it broken we could see the market could pull back to 5250.

"Personally, I expect it to bounce with the other indexes. The RSI and Stochastics are showing heavily
oversold levels.

"For our market, resistance begins at 5470, the key level is 5500.

"For us for the week we would want to see a close above 5500/5500 and for support at 5400 to hold.

"Global indexes are in short term downtrend but all are showing signs of potentially being oversold. We are
likely to get a bounce, whether short term or a more solid rally.

"For today, intra day support is at 5430, resistance is at 5470. I will call it up 35 on the day".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 73.7 points to 5435.3 on Friday.

companies increased by 5.5% during the year to $23.2 million with dividend payments to their

He said the bank has taken further steps to strengthen its capital base and funding capacity.

Analysts expectations: $378.7 mln, div 32c/$384.5 mln/$382.1 mln/$349 mln/$440 mln.
*On August 1 a leading broker retained a "buy" on BEN with a price target of $13.27.

(particularly deposit) spreads.

To this end it expects BEN's 2nd half 2014 NIM to be 3bp up half on half vs 2 bp up half on half for BOQ
and 2 bp down hoh on average for major banks. Current pricing suggests there could be some further
carry through of the strong margin performance into first half 2015.

*On July 24 a leading broker had an "equal weight" on BEN with a price target of $11.30.

The broker said it doubted investors expected material Great Southern losses, but the settlement removes
a source of downside risk.

upside to our margin forecasts and a potential capital and ROE benefit from lower mortgage risk
weightings over the next 2/3 years.
*On July 24 Nomura had a "buy" on Bendigo & Adelaide with a new price target $13.50, up from $13.

Nomura added across the sector it continues to prefer exposure to the regional banks. "We are still seeing
supportive trends with the ongoing improvement in wholesale funding markets as well as favorable pricing
conditions in the retail deposit market. Moreover, we believe the Financial System inquiry is likely to have
less of an impact on the regionals vs the major banks.
