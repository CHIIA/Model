The Asia-Pacific metallurgical coal spot market saw good activity to end the week, with a series of spot
deals done in the last two days, sources said Friday.
Platts observed at least nine deals for premium, non-prime hard coking, and pulverized coal injection
(PCI) material in India and China.

Premium low-vol hard coking coal was assessed 25 cents higher day on day to $122.75/mt CFR
China, equating to $110.25/mt FOB Australia netting back with Panamax freight and $113.80/mt FOB
using a Capesize calculation.
Prices for non-prime material were steady at $105/mt CFR China.
There also appeared to be greater interest from buyers in northern China — the Hebei and Tangshan
regions — particularly for second-tier hard coking coals.
Jitters about further domestic coal price cuts in China have seen buyers ask for bigger discounts from
foreign miners, a Beijing trader said.

"It is a bad time to enter the market now when you do not know when prices will fall, and by how
much," the trader said.

"Most end-users say they expect prices to continue to slide, and are in no rush to bid for anything," a
mining source said.
Commenting on resilient steel prices, a met coal trader said that while producers might have been
seeing better profit margins, it had not changed their buying habits.

Spot HRC prices in Shanghai were assessed at Yuan 3,410/mt ex-stock Friday, up Yuan 25/mt since
the start of the month, Platts data showed.

Robust liquidity to end the week
In the premium coal category, there was a slight firming of price expectations for the best regarded
Australian premium low-vol.
Bid indications from Chinese steelmakers, traders and miners pointed to a tradeable value of
$123-123.50/mt CFR China.

An index-linked transaction was reported done Thursday for an Australian 69-71% CSR blended
premium mid-to-low vol, 100,000 mt, August-mid laycan cargo. The purchase price would be fixed at a
3% discount to the August monthly average price of Platts and Argus combined premium low-vol CFR
China indices.

CSR, 22-25% VM and 9-11% ash HCC at $117-118/mt FOB Australia. This was an August-mid laycan,
45,000 mt shipment.

In the second-tier HCC segment, Canadian 67-72% CSR, 22-24% VM, 9-10% ash and 7-8 CSN was
traded Thursday at $113/mt CFR China. This was an 80,000 mt shipment discharging in two Chinese
ports, with a mid- to end-July laycan.

An Australian HCC with 57% CSR, 21.5% VM, 7.5% ash, 0.4% sulfur, 0.05% phosphorous, 11% total
moisture and 7 CSN was also transacted at parity with the average August price of Platts HCC 64 Mid
Vol index. The deal involved 50,000 mt of material in a Capesize vessel, with mid-August laycan.
On PCI, a low-vol, 12% ash coal was reported done Friday at $82.50/mt FOB Australia for a 75,000
mt, September 1-10 laycan cargo.

A deal was also done Thursday for Australian PCI with 18-20% VM, 11-12% ash and around 80 HGI at
around $91-93/mt CFR China. This was for an end-August, Panamax-size cargo. A 20,000 mt,
July-end laycan, Russian 3-4% VM and 13% ash anthracite fines vessel was also reported traded at
$88/mt CFR China.
Elsewhere, despite Chinese authorities' call to streamline the domestic coke market, output only
edged marginally lower in the first six months of this year.
Coke production in China in June fell 0.5% year on year to 4.1 million mt, customs data showed. That
meant first-half volumes slipped 1.1% to 23.4 million mt.
In the paper market, the September coking coal contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, the
most liquid, fell Yuan 10/mt ($1.62/mt) to the last-traded price of Yuan 754/mt, while the September
coke contract slipped Yuan 4/mt to Yuan 1,081/mt.
