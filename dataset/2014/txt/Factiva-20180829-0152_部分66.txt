$A called lower by analysts in a Bloomberg poll

*Bloomberg in a roundup of top forecasters has numbers varying from 80US c up to 83US c for the $A -
the most accurate forecaster at predicting the $A over the past four quarters, Tim Fox, Dubai based chief
economist at Emirates expects the $A to fall to 80US c by December 31. Second ranked forecaster HSBC
is projecting a slide to 86US c, one cent below the median of 39 year end forecasters polled by
Bloomberg.
*China's CPI continues to fall but so does the PPI
China's CPI has come in at 2.5% for December vs a year earlier, and vs 3% in November from a year
earlier, compared with 3.2% in October.
Meanwhile, China's PPI for December fell PPI fell 1.4% year on year in December the China National
Bureau of Statistics reported, marking a decline for 22 consecutive months, unchanged from November
while annualised PPI for 2013 fell 1.9% year on year - a dampener for the markets.
Our market closed in the positive after being down around 4 points since China's CPI and PPI numbers -
down about 10 points before that - rising in the last 70 minutes by 26 points.
While a "buy" portfolio would be the obvious culprit some stocks in the Top 20 were barely changed
including FMG (down 3c at the close from down 3.5c) and BHP closed down 7c at the close vs being off
16c earlier, and QBE closed up 29c after being up 13c at midday, Woodside rose from up 5c at midday to
up 12c. CBA, up 1c at midday closed up 10c.

A relief rally is a likely explanation - with our market falling for four out of the first five trading days this
year - today the only riser.

There was very little corporate news to drive our market either way.

Page182of276©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Down 10 today - break of next support level at 5300 would be quite bearish"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "Our market closed right on support yesterday, with the
next support level at 5300. A break of 5300 would be quite bearish in the short term. Resources are
continuing to under perform.

"I'll call it down 10 points today - we have already factored in some of the sell off on the Dow last night".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 1 point to 5316 last evening.

*"New Zealand the rock star economy of 2014" - HSBC

On January 8 (US time) HSBC in an analyst report said New Zealand's economy could be one of fastest
growing markets of 2014, with growth predictions set to outperform similar developed markets, according
to HSBC, and creating an even larger gap between it and Australia, which is lacking a push towards
economic growth.

"We think New Zealand will be the rock star economy of 2014. Growth is going to pick up pretty solidly
this year," Paul Bloxham, chief economist for Australia and New Zealand at HSBC, told CNBC.

HSBC predicts 3.4 % economic growth in 2014, well above 2.5 % trend growth and the fastest clip since
2007. The bank expects the economy to grow 3 % for 2013.

Bloxham noted there are three signs that point to a stronger economy.
* The Reserve Bank of India has raised the cap on the proportion of loan to the value of gold.. Finance
companies can lend as much as 75% of the value of the gold deposited with them, up from 60% earlier,
the central bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
