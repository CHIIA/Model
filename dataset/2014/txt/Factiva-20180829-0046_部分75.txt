AURIZON yesterday warned of an up to $382 million profit hit and the loss of almost 600 jobs as
the coal freight giant desperately struggles to adapt to lower demand.

It revealed that on top of the up to 480 jobs it last month said would be lost from its planned
closure of the Redbank and Townsville rolling stock maintenance operations, it has also shed 103
jobs, mainly at its Brisbane head office.

As a result it expects second-half impairments and provisions to erode earnings by between $130
million and $160 million.
For the year to June 30, the earnings hit will be between $352 million and $382 million.
Queensland’s second largest company by market capitalisation releases full-year financial results
on August 18.
It comes after rival Asciano last week blamed an earnings hit from deferred greenfield coal
projects, and other factors, for shedding 500 jobs.

Aurizon said the cutbacks reflected its “best assessment” of the current and short-term outlook for
domestic and global coal markets, marked by deferrals or cancellations of major projects.

Aurizon chief executive Lance Hockridge said the actions were a “comprehensive” response by
Aurizon to the sector’s weaker outlook.

He said the outlook for Australia’s resources sector “is still very attractive, (but) it is clearly more
subdued”.

Aurizon received some good news yesterday on its potential takeover of Aquila Resources with
China’s Baosteel.
They are keen to take control of Aquila so they can kickstart the stalled $10 billion West Pilbara
Iron Ore Project.
Aquila co-founder Charles Bass, who holds a 10.7 per cent stake, yesterday said he would accept
the $1.4 billion bid.

Aquila’s CEO, Tony Poli earlier said he would accept it, and Aquila’s independent board committee
has recommended shareholders accept.Aurizon shares fell 4¢ to $4.96 yesterday.
