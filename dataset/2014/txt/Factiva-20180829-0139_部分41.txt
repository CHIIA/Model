Vector Resources says mining operations at its Gwendolyn gold project, 190km north of Southern
Cross, should begin this month.
Vector, in which China’s Eagle Bright Holdings holds a stake worth about 16 per cent, has all the
mining approvals for a small-scale open pit. The operation is only short-term so Vector can assess
the project’s economics.

In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday, Vector said temporary camp
facilities were scheduled to mobilise in mid-February. “By processing the bulk sample, Vector will be
able to accurately forecast the economics of the remaining phase one and larger-scale phase two
operations at Gwendolyn based on an established set of data parameters obtained from the bulk
sample,” the statement said.
Vector has secured a $3 million debt facility to fund the campaign.
