Property investment - Sandstone properties attract covetous eyes

Eureka Funds Management has emerged as the latest serious contender to run an eye over the
Sandstone properties in Bridge Street, Sydney, as the market for hotels and investment assets
heats up before the end of the year.

This comes amid speculation that the owners of the Westin Hotel at the GPO, Sydney, and the
Hilton, Sydney, could also consider selling.
The trigger was said to be China's Sunshine Insurance Group purchase of the Sheraton on the
Park in Sydney for $463 million, which is the highest price yet for a hotel in Australia.

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide will continue to operate the Sheraton under a long-term
management agreement.
The NSW government is also hoping for a competitive price from the sale of the Lands and
Education buildings, called the Sandstone properties.
They are to be converted for tourism use, including a hotel. One price estimate has valued the
Lands building at $80 million, with a 99-year lease.
Eureka recently sold its half share of 101 Miller Street and Greenwood Plaza to TIAA Henderson
real estate for $310 million. Eureka has shown an interest in the hotel sector, and last year sold
the Four Seasons in Sydney for a record $340 million.

The Sandstone assets would allow Eureka to flex its skills of buying assets and redeveloping for
sales at a significant profit.

Industry body Tourism & Transport Forum chief executive Margy Osmond said there was significant
interest from the tourism industry in the heritage buildings and the sector was keen to explore the
opportunities they represented.
One of the latest deals is by the private W Property, which has bought 132 McEvoy Street,
Alexandria, with plans to refurbish the buildings and return them to their original glory as
commercial and industrial sites and then sell down to owner-occupiers in 2015.
Knight Frank South Sydney agency director Danny O'Brien, who advised on the sale, declined to
comment on the price.
Other agents said similar properties in the area recently sold for about $30 million.

"We expect demand to be strong for owner-occupiers as most of the South Sydney occupiers are
cashing in on their land values now and moving to more efficient buildings," Mr O'Brien said.

completed on Monday when Charter Hall paid $171.4 million for a portfolio of six industrial assets.

CBRE's Danny Thomas and Mark Granter, who advised on the deal, said it was the largest food
and agribusiness real estate transaction in 2014, by a good margin.
