23:36 GMT [Dow Jones] Downer EDI (DOW.AU) has around A$450 million that it can spend on buying
back its own shares or M&A, and Macquarie thinks the engineering contractor is likely to make a
decision soon. In August, Downer said it would buy up to 10% of its stock but has yet to acquire a single
share. For Macquarie, this means that Downer has either secured a material contract win or is looking at
a potential acquisition. "We view the latter as more likely," the broker says. If Downer was to spend
A$300 million on acquisitions at a multiple of 6-7 times earnings, Macquarie estimates this would
generate A$46 million of additional earnings before interest and tax or A$18 million of net profit after
accounting for debt funding. DOW last traded at A$4.23. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

23:35 GMT {Dow Jones} The breadth of Aristocrat Leisure's (ALL.AU) gambling products and its recent
performance suggest the company is well positioned to continue grabbing market share in North
America, Deutsche Bank says. "Customer feedback continues to improve and we believe recent industry
consolidation provides additional opportunities for Aristocrat to increase share," it says, adding the
company's Video Gaming Technologies business is much better positioned than the brokerage had first
envisaged. It retains a buy recommendation with the shares trading at a discount to a price target lifted
to A$7.75/share from A$7.20. ALL shares are currently down 0.1% at A$5.885. (robb.stewart@wsj.com;

11:26 GMT [Dow Jones] Year-to-date Uridashi issuance is on pace to pick up modestly from 2013, says
Brown Brothers Harriman. Foreign currency-denominated issuance peaked at $24.4 billion in 2010
before falling three straight years to $15.3 billion in 2013, which was the lowest annual total since 2007.
BBH says that so far in 2014, issuance is on a $16 billion annualized pace. A fourth quarter pickup
could see the full year total potentially eclipse the $16.5 billion seen in 2012, it adds.

2326 GMT [Dow Jones] Bank of Queensland Ltd. (BOQ.AU) is likely to turn in a strong fiscal 2014 result,
albeit a somewhat "messy" one due to the acquisition of assets from Investec Ltd. (INL.JO), Deutsche
Bank says. It forecasts full-year cash earnings of 302.4 million Australian dollars ($263.5 million),
slightly ahead of the bank's own guidance for earnings of about A$298 million. Still, the brokerage
retains a hold recommendation and A$12.45/share ($10.85) target and says BOQ needs to demonstrate
that it can return to reasonable levels of asset growth or show further upside from deposit repricing. BOQ
is trading down 1.9% at A$11.64. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)
1923 ET [Dow Jones] -- Iron-ore prices have crept higher, bouncing from five-year lows to regain their
footing at the "psychological US$80/ton barrier," says ANZ. While any lift in prices will help the many
producers struggling to break even at current levels, the steelmaking commodity remains down 40%
year-to-date after a surge in mine supply. Still, the immediate outlook for prices remains unclear,
analysts say. Market liquidity remains weak, with many Chinese buyers having been absent for the
so-called Golden Week holiday. China is the world's largest buyer of the raw material. Spot iron-ore
lifted 1.4% on Tuesday to US$80.00/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

11:24 GMT [Dow Jones] A tough start to the TV advertising market in FY15 is probably more cyclical
than structural, meaning a recent sell-off in Seven West Media (SWM.AU) is overdone, says Deutsche
Bank, which upgrades its recommendation on the Australian media group to buy from hold. Advertising
volumes in 1Q15 are likely to be down around 10% on-year, but mostly because of a spike in
government advertising last year for national elections. "Our discussions with media buyers suggest a

Page4of335©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.number of advertisers are increasing marketing spend, and, given that audiences for key events are
continuing to hold up, we view the current issues around the TV ad market as cyclical rather than
structural. The broker raises its price target to A$2.00 from A$1.90. SWM is down 1.5% at A$1.60.

23:25 GMT [Dow Jones] Citi initiates coverage of AGL Energy (AGK.AU) with a buy recommendation
and A$15.56 price target, noting the energy retailer has underperformed its peers and the ASX100 over
the last six months. It also likes its recent acquisition of Macquarie Generation in New South Wales
state, which it says the market is undervaluing. "MacGen's location in the Upper Hunter valley and
burning low quality, non-exportable coal means that it has a structural coal cost advantage," it says,
valuing the asset at A$1.9 billion-to-A$2.0 billion, or A$2.90/share. AGK is down 0.4% at
A$13.53.(Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
2321 GMT [Dow Jones] Gold's slide to around $1,210/oz. can be explained not just by a stronger U.S.
dollar--the pair tend to share an inverse correlation--but by easing concerns about inflation, according to
HSBC precious metals analyst James Steel. "The decline in inflation expectations has played a
secondary role in pressuring gold," he says, noting the U.S. 10-year break-even yield--a proxy for the
market's inflation expectations--has fallen to a 15-month low. "A lack of inflationary expectations is
traditionally bearish for gold," which is often bought as an alternative store of value, says Mr. Steel.

23:21 GMT [Dow Jones] Part of the decline in mall traffic among U.S. teenagers can be attributed to the
establishment of mall curfews and added security in the 2000s, according to analysts at Piper Jaffray in
their semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens report on teenage consumer behavior. The average number
of annual mall trips by teens aged 13-19 has fallen 26% to 29 visits per year from its peak in 2007, the
firm notes, due in part to the beefed up security against "disruptive" teens, as well as other factors
including the rise of e-commerce and decline of logo-based fashion trends. To illustrate the imposing
nature of mall security, the firm includes within the note a standalone screen grab of the DVD cover of
"Mall Cop," a 2009 film starring Kevin James. (sara.germano@wsj.com @germanotes)

19:20 ET [Dow Jones] Travel insurer Cover-More Group (CVO.AU) is a good way to bet on changing
travel preferences among Australians, according to Bell Potter. The broker expects the longer-term
structural shift toward outbound versus domestic holiday travel to continue, despite slowing growth in
outbound departures in August. "The best way to play this recovery is through CVO given its travel
insurance business is leveraged to short-term international departure volumes for holiday purposes," the
broker says. It notes that Cover-More isn't adversely impacted by any offsetting decline in international
airfares, in contrast to Flight Centre (FLT.AU), given premiums change only marginally based on the
price of travel. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones] The Australian dollar is among the G-10 currency basket's current top 10
performers having rallied overnight on the back of short-covering to a high around $0.8834. It has
covered a lot of ground quickly. After U.S. payrolls on Friday, it had been trading around $0.8650. In the
absence of key domestic data, the Aussie dollar is expected to trade quietly until the release of
September employment data on Thursday. Greg Moore, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets said China PMI data will be the most significant data in Asia followed by the release of
September FOMC minutes. AUD/USD now $0.8809. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

[Dow Jones] 22:47 Empired (EPD.AU), an Australian company that provides information technology
services to business, offers a more technical and customized package than rivals, justifying a buy
recommendation and A$0.95 price target, says Bell Potter. The bullish call comes despite the company
last month issuing new shares at a discount to potentially fund acquisitions, prompting Bell Potter to
downgraded its per share earnings forecast by 8-10% over the next three financial years. Part of its price
target is dependent on the company making an acquisition in the next few months. "So we are giving
the company the benefit of the doubt at this stage but the clock is ticking," the broker says. Empired was
last at A$0.745. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
