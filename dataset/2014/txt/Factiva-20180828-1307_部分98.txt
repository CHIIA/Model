Shares dip despite retail figures

Stocks Sally Rose

A negative mood in global equity markets resulted in Australian shares posting a modest fall, despite the
release of some better-than- expected retail sales data. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the
broader All Ordinaries Index each fell 0.3 per cent on Monday to 5540.9 points and 5533.3 points
respectively. While the market overall was weak, merger and acquisition activity gave some stocks,
notably Treasury Wine Estates, a boost. Local shares fell as much as 0.5per cent in early trade after the
US S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined, despite the release of a solid jobs report
on Friday night. "Australian shares trended lower as investors reacted to further falls in US and European
bourses on Friday. Volumes were on the light side,

affected by Monday's NSW bank holiday," Patersons Securities chief investment strategist Tony Farnham
said. Asian markets provided mixed cues in the afternoon session. When the ASX closed, Hong Kong's
Hang Seng and China's Shanghai Composite Index were both stronger, while Japan's Nikkei had
slipped. China's non-manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a six-month low of 54.2 points in
July, dragged down by a weaker property market. New retail sales data helped the big food and liquor
sellers outperform. Woolworths and Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, each edged up.

Declines in the big four banks pulled the index lower. Commonwealth Bank of Australia shed 0.3per cent
to $82.58, while Westpac Banking Corporation dropped 0.6 per cent to $33.85. ANZ Banking Group lost
0.7 per cent to $33.34, and National Australia Bank fell 0.5 per cent to $34.77. BHP Billiton was down 0.3
per cent to $38.30. Main rival Rio Tinto edged up 0.1per cent to $65.43 despite the spot price for iron ore,
landed in China, slipping 0.4 per cent to $US95.20 a tonne. When the market closed, Dalian iron ore
futures trading in China was tipping a rise overnight. Junior iron ore miner Atlas Iron was the
best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 9.2 per cent to 71ï¿½ after delivering an upbeat
presentation to the annual Diggers and Dealers conference. Explorer Nido Petroleum soared 24.4 per
cent to 5ï¿½ as Thailand's Bangchak Group made a $113 million cash takeover offer.
