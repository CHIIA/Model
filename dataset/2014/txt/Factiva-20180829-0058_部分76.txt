At home Meridian sells solar plant
Meridian Energy, the country's largest listed power company, has sold its Californian solar plant for an
undisclosed sum, wrapping up its exit from the US energy market. The Wellington-based company
sold its CalRENEW-1 plant to California-based SunEdison, it said. The plant was the biggest asset of
Meridian's US subsidiary, which owed the parent $27 million in related party loans as at June 30 last
year. Meridian wore a $2 million impairment charge on the loan in the 2013 financial year, having
written down the loan by $27.4 million a year earlier.

TrustPower expects lift
TrustPower is expecting an after-tax uplift in earnings of A$19.9 million within two years from stage two
of its South Australian Snowtown wind project. In an investor briefing in Sydney posted to the NZX, 51.1
per cent Infratil-owned TrustPower said it was projecting a contribution of A$14.7 million to net profit
after tax in the 2015 financial year and A$19.9 million in the 2016 year. A further A$50 million in
capital expenditure will be required in the 2015 year, but the A$439 million project will be complete in
the 2016 year.

Ryman shares edge down

Shares in Ryman Healthcare weakened for a second day on Friday on the expectation New Zealand's
largest listed retirement village operator will post slower earnings growth in coming years as its costs
increase. Christchurch-based Ryman on Thursday posted an 18 per cent rise in underlying earnings to
$118.2 million for the year ended March 31. Increased costs from staff and wages meant annual
earnings growth slowed to a 14 per cent pace in the second half, from a 22 per cent rate in the first half,
said brokerage Craigs Investment Partners. Ryman s shares closed down 5c at $8.65.

World Goodman backs takeover
Australian food giant Goodman Fielder, which makes and sells bread, biscuits, sauces, spreads and
oils, has accepted a sweetened A$1.37 billion takeover offer from two Asian firms. The company's
board met on Friday to consider the new bid from Singapore-listed Wilmar, the world's biggest palm oil
processor, and Hong Kong investment firm First Pacific. Goodman Fielder released an after-market
statement saying that in the absence of a superior proposal, the board will unanimously recommend
that Goodman shareholders vote in favour of the revised offer.

GM pays $35m penalty
General Motors' agreement to pay a US$35 million federal fine for concealing defects in small-car
ignition switches and to give the government greater oversight of its safety procedures closes one
chapter of the carmaker's recall saga. But it's far from over. Besides agreeing to pay the penalty, the
largest assessed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, GM admitted that it broke the
law by failing to quickly tell the government about the problems. The carmaker agreed to report safety
problems a lot faster. It only started recalling 2.6 million small cars this February, more than a decade
after engineers first found a flaw in the switches. The company says at least 13 people have died in
crashes linked to the problem, but trial lawyers suing the company say the death toll is at least 53.

US home construction surged in April to its highest pace in five months. Almost all that increase came
from the volatile apartment sector, a sign that Americans are still struggling to buy single-family homes.
The Commerce Department said on Saturday that builders started work on 1.07 million homes at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate in April up 13.2 per cent from March. The gains were driven by a 42.9
per cent jump in apartments and condominiums. The rate of building single-family homes rose just 0.8
per cent. - Agencies
