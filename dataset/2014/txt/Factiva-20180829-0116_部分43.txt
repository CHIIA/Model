The Adani Group of Ahmedabad plans to divest half of its stake in projects they took over in 2011 to part
finance the required investment of $8-9 billion. The projects included development of Carmichael coal
mine and laying of a rail line in Australia. The Adanis initiated talks with China Rail Corporation and
another Chinese firm in this regard. The Carmichael mine requires an investment of $5 billion while $2.5
billion will be needed for a 400-km rail line to cart the coal to a port which again will need further $1
billion to build.
