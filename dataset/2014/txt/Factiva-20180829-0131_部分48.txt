ENERGY URANIUM producer Paladin Energy’s loss-making woes have worsened following a third
straight year of subdued prices for the energy source.
Paladin yesterday tabled a first-half loss of $284 million, 32 per cent worse than its $218 million
half-year loss in 2012-13.

The producer with projects in Australian and Africa also said it did not expect any short-term
improvement after shutting one of its two producing mines last week and reducing production
guidance for the year.

However, it predicts the nuclear power industry will recover and the long-term future will be positive
for uranium producers, with mine closures and lack of investment in new supply to spark sharp price
rises.
Chinese giant China National Nuclear Corp agreed last year to pay Paladin $212 million for a 25
per cent stake in Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia, with regulatory approval expected this year.
The company’s shares closed unchanged yesterday at 47.5c.
Paladin’s loss was inflated by a $252.5 million impairment on its Queensland exploration assets.
Stripping those out, its gross result was a $33 million loss, compared to an $12.6 million profit last
year.It blamed the loss on a 21 per cent fall in the uranium price and higher impairment of inventory
at its loss-making Kayelekera mine in Malawi.
