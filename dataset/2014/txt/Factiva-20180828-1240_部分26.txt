POSITIVE pre-sale buyer comments about the ideal presentation of the draft and the Boshammer
family's ability to put forward their best and heaviest line-up were key drivers behind their successful
annual Sandon Glenoch Angus bull sale, Glenoch, Chinchilla, last Wednesday.
The Boshammer family's 23rd on-property fixture posted a solid result after 116 bulls averaged $4010
despite the challenges faced by many beef producers.

Typical of the long-term clients was Kevin Graham, who operated through Landmark Rockhampton on
behalf of Alistair and Jo McClymont, AJM Pastoral, Burleigh Station, Richmond, because he recognised
the exceptional doing ability of the Sandon and Glenoch bulls.

"These bulls do handle the tough going and have a strong constitution and will work," he said.

In addition, Mr Graham was selecting low gestation length (GL) and high-fertility bulls and paid up to
$7000 for Glenoch Hamilton H238, a quality son of Ardrossan Equator A241, which recorded -4.2 for
GL and +3.4 for scrotal size and averaged $4666 for his three bulls.
The Boshammers tagged their sale as 'Bulls That Work', and according to the buyers in attendance
they deliver on that front.

Glenoch Hampton H256, a moderate-framed son of A241 showing plenty of capacity and muscle
attracted the $12,000 top money from Patrick and Melody Rynne, Jilliby, Tara. G Hampton offered great
flexibility being breed average or better for every EBV trait and was the complete package. The Rynnes
also bought another A241 son, Glenoch Havilah H370, with a well-balanced set of figures for $6500.

Leading carcase competition exponents Bill, Sue and Ed Willis, Bullamon Plains Pastoral, Thallon,
outlaid $10,000 for the first bull into the ring, Glenoch Harlin H304, another A241 son with impressive
growth figures and a powerful hind quarter.
Leading commercial operators John and Guy Campbell, Barramornie, Condamine, were again active
on the top end paying up to $8500 for Glenoch Hinman H221, a standout son of Tuwharetoa Regent
D145 with high ranking carcase EBVs. The Campbells bought five Regent sons for a $4300 average.

Other high-priced bulls were Glenoch Harrow H335, another impressive Regent son that was knocked
down to Garth Christianson, Campo Station, Taroom, for $10,000 and Scott and Dana Leeson, Leeson
Cattle Company, Maloneys, Moura paid $9000 for another Regent-sired bull, Glenoch Hank H269 and
$6500 for the A241 son in Glenoch Handgun H257.
Regular buyers Peter and Vicki Howard, Nogoa Pastoral Company, Duckponds, Emerald, were on the
lookout for carcase attributes, fertility and softness when they bought Glenoch Helmet H412 for $8000
and another three similar types for a $5125 average.

Volume buyers included Tonkin Farming, Mungindi with six bulls for a $4083 average and Karinya
Cattle Company, Taroom with eight bulls to average $4125.
