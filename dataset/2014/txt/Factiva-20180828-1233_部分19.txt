IN BRIEF
China market chased

FONTERRA outlined a plan yesterday to take a 20% stake in Chinese infant food manufacturer
Beingmate and said it would spend $555 million on expanding its milk powder-making capacity in New
Zealand.

The co-operative said it intended to form a global partnership with Beingmate that would help meet
China’s growing demand for infant formula.
The partnership would create a fully integrated global supply chain from the farm gate direct to China’s
consumers, using Fonterra’s milk pools and manufacturing sites in NZ, Australia and Europe.
Fonterra will shortly start the process to issue a partial tender offer to gain up to a 20% stake in
Beingmate.

After regulatory approvals are gained and Fonterra satisfactorily completes the partial tender offer,
Fonterra and Beingmate will set up a joint venture to purchase Fonterra’s Darnum plant in Australia and
establish a distribution agreement to sell Fonterra’s Anmum brand in China, the company says.
Fonterra chief executive Theo Spierings described the Chinese infant formula market as the world’s
biggest growth story in pediatric nutrition.

Labour offers carrot

LABOUR in New Zealand will offer first-home buyers two-bedroom properties in Auckland for as little as
$360,000, party leader David Cunliffe has announced.

Labour’s KiwiBuild policy would build 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years and sell them at cost, he
said, adding a similar home now cost $485,000.

The policy would result in a couple earning $75,000 being $200 a week better off than under National’s
housing policy, Mr Cunliffe said.
