Deal lapses on failure to reach LNG project investment decision

Woodside Petroleum said Thursday that a 2012 deal to sell LNG from the Browse project in Western
Australia to Mitsubishi and Mitsui's Japan Australia LNG joint venture MIMI has lapsed because of a
failure to reach a final investment decision.

MIMI had agreed to buy 1.5 million mt/year of LNG from the Browse project in April last year under a
sales and purchase agreement in conjunction with its acquisition of a 14.7% equity stake for $2
billion.

The deal also included an agreement for Woodside and MIMI to jointly market co-mingled LNG
volumes to Asia, primarily to Japanese customers.

In a filing to the Australian Securities Exchange, Woodside said: "The SPA was conditional upon a final
investment decision on Browse being taken by 31 December 2013."

"As a result of the Browse joint venture participants deciding not to proceed with an onshore
development and to enter basis of design for a floating LNG development concept, both parties
recognize that this condition [of achieving FID] will not be satisfied. Consequently, MIMI has today
given Woodside notice terminating the SPA," the Australian company said.

The joint marketing agreement still remains, Woodside said, adding that it is also in ongoing
discussions with other regional customers regarding potential LNG sales.

FID by mid-2015

Woodside in April ruled out building an onshore liquefaction facility to process its Browse gas at a site
backed by the Western Australian state government on James Price Point. Woodside is currently
undertaking basis of design studies for a floating LNG development for its offshore Browse fields.

Woodside leads the Browse joint venture with partners Shell, BP, PetroChina, Mitsui and Mitsubishi.
The Australian company is targeting a final investment decision on the FLNG project by mid-2015.

Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said last month that he expected early cost estimates for the Browse
FLNG project to be available in the first or second quarter of 2014. The development would utilize
technology developed by Shell, which is currently building its first FLNG facility for the Prelude field in
the Browse Basin.

The Browse project is expected to comprise two or three FLNG facilities, each with capacity of 3.6
million mt/year. The Browse resource totals 15.5 Tcf of gas and 417 million barrels of condensate,
held in the offshore Torosa, Calliance and Brecknock fields.

Coleman has previously said the FLNG option would be 30% to 50% cheaper than an onshore James
Price Point project over the life of the Browse fields.

Woodside is set to get marketing negotiations for Browse gas underway ahead of FID.

"The advantage on Browse is that it's pretty much just a Woodside decision, because ... two of [the
partners] are portfolio players, being BP and Shell, so they'll need to make their own decision, Mitsui
and Mitsubishi are trading houses and PetroChina will likely run [the LNG] into their own operations in
China," the Woodside boss said.

"The actual marketing risk we see is fairly low because it's pretty much us ... The good part about it is
each player will be able to actively market its own gas."
