KUALA LUMPUR--1Malaysia Development Bhd, a Malaysian state-owned investment company also
known as 1MDB, said Wednesday it will partner with Australia's Lend Lease Group to develop a retail
and residential project worth over 8 billion ringgit ($2.48 billion).

The project, dubbed TRX Lifestyle Quarter, comprises a hotel, three residential towers and shopping
mall across more than 17 acres within the proposed Tun Razak Exchange financial hub in downtown
Kuala Lumpur. Lend Lease will be the majority shareholder in the joint venture while 1MDB will hold a
"significant" stake.

Development of the Lifestyle Quarter is expected to attract up to $1 billion in foreign direct investments
to Malaysia, the two companies said in a joint statement.

The new financial district is part of Malaysia's ambition to become the next major Asian financial hub,
rivaling Singapore and Hong Kong. Tun Razak Exchange is expected to generate a gross
development value of 26 billion ringgit. Gross development value refers to the potential retail or sale
value of the properties after construction.

In March, 1MDB signed Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments PJS as one of the first major anchor investors
in the Tun Razak Exchange project.
