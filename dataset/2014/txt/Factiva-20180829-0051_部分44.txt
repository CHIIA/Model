The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close higher today.

Markets rose in Europe, were down a touch in the UK and rose in the US.

On the NYSE where 3226 issues traded there were 2,450 issues higher, 698 down and 78 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2,098 issues traded there were 2,098 issues higher, 579 down and 58 unchanged.
Metals were mixed in a narrow range, crude was mixed, gold rose. The $A is at 93.38 US c, up 55 points
from last evening.

"Resistance is at 5450, then at 5470 .. up 25 points for the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "There was a positive reaction on equities last night on
the ECB move.

"The S&P500 again broke previous highs intra day, closing not far off its high for the night Volume last
night was the highest so far this week, but not at the highest levels we have seen.
"Copper is still sitting on support, there was not much price action last night.
"Gold had a bit of a bounce. It is likely to have a bit of a dead cat bounce in coming days but I still think it
will remain under pressure for the rest of this year.

"The Euro briefly spiked down to 1.35US c which was one of the DCB plans, to devalue their currency,
but it defied the odds to sharply push back to 1.38/30US c at one stage.

"Shanghai saw a good move yesterday, closing above the 20 day moving average and above 2040 so
that it looks like it was a false break on Thursday. We still need to see it close above 2060 for any signs of
a bullish breakout.

"US 10 year bond yields took a bit of a breather last night, but probably are going to consolidate between
2.55% and 2.65%.

"The XJO had another weak day. We have seen a lot of selling pressure against the rising US market.
Yesterday's close was again bearish. It did not close on its lows, but closed well below 5450.

"Given moves on markets overnight, it may close back above 5450 for the week, but still remain below the
20 day moving average.

"Our market is still in a short term correction. But I would not be surprised to see DAX and Euro stocks fall
in coming weeks.

"Resistance for our market is at 5450, next at 5470. Support will now be 5430.

Page132of272©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The short term outlook is still bearish in my view. For the day I will call us up 25 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 7.9 points to 5436.9 last evening.

June 6. Good morning.

* BBC News reports leaders of the G7 industrial nations have urged Russia to begin talks with the new
leadership in Kiev to end the crisis in eastern Ukraine. US President Barack Obama and UK PM David
Cameron said Moscow must recognise Petro Poroshenko, who takes office as president on Saturday.

The G7 leaders meeting in Brussels said they were fully behind Mr Poroshenko.
Later in Paris Mr Cameron met Russian President Vladimir Putin, giving him a "very clear and firm set of
messages'.

"The status quo, the situation today, is not acceptable and it needs to change," Mr Cameron said. "We
need the Russians to properly recognise and work with this new president. We need de-escalation, we
need to stop arms and people crossing the border. We need action on these fronts."

Mr Putin is meeting French President Francois Hollande for dinner. Mr Hollande will see Mr Obama at a
separate meal.

Trading points:

*BAB/NGF: T/o panel to take no action after BAB, NGF undertakings
The Takeovers Panel (TOV) said in response to an application dated May 13 from Norton Gold Fields Ltd
in relation to the affairs of Bullabulling Gold Ltd, the TOV

said it was minded to make an unacceptable circumstances ruling, however it has accepted the
undertakings given by Bullabulling.

(BAB said 41.8% of shareholders would not accept the takeover offer - without informing the rejecting
shareholders how the statements were to be used, nor obtaining their consent, also the statements were
no more than their intentions at a certain point of time).
Also Norton gold when saying 6.6% of BAB shareholders supported its bid, comprising shares held by
Gold Mountains (HK) International Mining company and Phoenix Gold Fund Ltd, it did not say that
Phoenix had soldsome of its shaes on market, and that it was associated with Gold Mountains and had
voting power of 2.5% in its stake. (Jun 5)

*VRL: 15c ff sp div/full yr 2014 now to be slightly below previous final

Village Roadshow Ltd announced directors have approved a 15c per share fully franked special dividend,
payable on July 17 with a record date of June 26 2014. The 15c per share special dividend represents a
total payment to VRL shareholders of approximately $24 million.

Profit guidance
The company revised profit guidance issued with the interim report in February that VRL expected it
would slightly exceed 2013 NPAT before material items.

However as the result of the generally disappointing box office performance of "Transcendence" and the
write off of the $2 million minimum guarantee write off, the forecast 2014 NPAT is now likely to be in line
with or slightly below 2013 NPAT. (Jun 5)

"Don't write off gold"

Pierpont (Trevor Sykes) in a delightful and erudite column in the Fin Review today summarised the history
of gold. Abridged extracts:
He said metal, usually gold, silver and copper that was the medium of exchange for some 4000 years,
and the history of paper money introduction (first issued in AD1328 by the MingDynasty in China) which
was popular since it was easier to carry, through the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 that set up the
IMF and the World Bank, when each member country had to declare the par value of its currency in gold.
The US set its dollar at $35 to the ounce.

However, the US began living beyond its means and in 1971 President Richard Nixon unilaterally ended
the convertiblity of the dollar into gold or silver in 1971, killing the gold standard internationally.

"The world's de facto reserve currency is still the US dollar, but it is not clear whether or how they can
ever repay their current $US17 trillion debt" he added.
Meanwhile gold soared to a peak of $US1895 in September 2011 - an implicit devaluaton of the US
dollar. Since then the US Federal Reserve has been pumping money into the banking system and the
bankers have been shorting gold.
"During that period Germany asked the US to repatriate the 674 tonnes of its gold they were holding in
Fort Knox. The US refused and wouldn't even let a German auditor into Fort Knox to verify the gold was
still there. So Pierpont is forced to conclude it obviously wasn't.
"So a country that doesn't hold gold is driving the price down to the detriment of countries that do hold
gold, notably China".

Pierpont offered 9 Lessons. The first, Gresham's law (bad currency drives out good) still holds he said.
The second - the main reason why the natural consequence of hyperinflation has not yet happened in the
US is that the other major convertible currencies - sterling, the Euro and the Yen - are in much the same
mess.

Lesson 3 is governments can become addicted to paper money. Lesson 4 says printing money or
quantitative easing needs bigger and bigger amounts printed for consumption to continue, just like a
heroin junkie needs bigger and bigger fixes. Lesson 5 looks at history, where invading countries and
native powers punished or beheaded anyone not using their currency. Lesson 6 is when currency has
been devastated, a new currency has to be invented - as in Germany when the Reichsmark was replaced
by the Rentenmark on a ratio of 1 trillion to 1, backed by a first mortgage on all the land and other
physical assets of the Reich.

Lesson 7 is that nations don't grow rich from consumption but through production. Lesson 9, "Pierpont
sincerely hopes Europe and the US can mend their ways and we will not see a global money panic. But if
we do, physical goods are the best hedge. In particular, gold has outlasted every currency on the planet".
Pierpont's conclusion: Western bankers who have very little gold are using bits of paper to damage the
value of gold held by China and other Asian nations. If the Chinese ever lose patience with those
bankers, all they have to do is start buying short dated Comex contracts and then insist on physical
delivery. If that day ever comes, Pierpont hopes all his readers will be holding a few gold bars as
insurance".
