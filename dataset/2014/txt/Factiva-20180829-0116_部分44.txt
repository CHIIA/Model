THIS WEEK MALAYSIAN BRUNCH

LUXBITE

RATING: very good

38 TOORAK ROAD, SOUTH YARRA,

9867 5888

UNLICENSED AE MC V EFTPOS

DAILY 10.30AM-7PM BRUNCH: $5-$15; MACARONS: $2.75;

EAT-IN CAKES: $7.50-$9

LuxBite is a dessert cafe in South Yarra, a suburb where sweet-tooth emporia and teeth-whitening clinics
seem to operate in roughly equal numbers. Owners Bernard Chu and Yen Yee worked the pastry stations
at restaurants including Rockpool, Quay and Comme before opening their own sleek, petite pleasure
dome in 2010. LuxBite is deservedly beloved for its East-meets-West macarons (pandan, say, or kaffir
lime) and superbly outlandish cakes, but should also be celebrated for its Malaysian-style savoury snacks
and brunches. The brunch menu is small but the dishes are sublime, mixing Malaysian and European
elements to inspired and purposeful effect. Satay-marinated chicken leg is turmeric-tinged, crisp-skinned
and as juicy as an overripe tomato. It pulls easily from the bone into soft, creamy polenta rimmed by burnt
butter sauce. Salty crunch comes courtesy of anchovies and peanuts, rumbled together in a jammy
version of ikan bilis, a dried anchovy condiment. Chicken also features alongside lap cheong (Chinese
pork sausage) in a sticky rice dish that's so hearty I was afraid it would overwhelm my dessert stomach.
Luckily, it's tempered by a crunchy iceberg lettuce and cucumber salad. Braised beef is textbook comfort
food, resting on soft bacon and potato mash, and topped with a fried egg with a wok-style crisp fringe.

The small dining room and elaborate cake display mean this isn't your average brunch hangout; if you
want the bathroom, you need to trot to a local park.

I am not the world's biggest macaron fan, but LuxBite's sour strawberry flavour could be the one to turn
me. I'm also fully on board with the Lolly Bag Cake and gluten-free Meringue Monster. Or you could buy
a cake-scented candle for sugar-free swooning.
