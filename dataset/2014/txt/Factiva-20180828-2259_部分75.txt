Australian shares fell for the third day in a row after fears of oversupply in China's property market
prompted the biggest fall in iron ore prices in almost six months.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each lost 0.6 per cent on
Wednesday to 5368.8 points and 5352.5points respectively. Positive leads from the United States,
where the S&P 500 hit a new five-year high, and from Europe, were overshadowed by worries about
weakness in commodity markets.

"We are staying out of the iron ore miners. The commodity price is likely to cycle lower still over the
coming years as it returns to the marginal cost of production for the biggest suppliers," Auscap Asset
Management portfolio manager Tim Carleton said.
Iron miners tumbled after the spot price for iron ore, delivered in China, on Tuesday evening lost
4.4 per cent to $US71.80 a tonne, a fresh five-year low. When the ASX closed, futures trading was
tipping another big fall overnight.
Small, high-cost producers were the hardest hit. BC Iron was the worst-performing stock in the ASX
200, sinking 12.2 per cent to 57.5¢ – its lowest point this year. Australia's biggest iron ore miners,
which are typically less exposed to daily fluctuations in the commodity price, were also lower.

Resources giant BHP Billiton lost 1.5 per cent to $32.67, while Rio Tinto shed 2.5 per cent to $57.98.
Fortescue Metals dropped 7.7 per cent to $2.74.
Australia's biggest oil producer Woodside Petroleum fell 1.1 per cent to $38.41 as it confirmed plans
to developed its Browse gas fields off the Kimberley coast. Brent crude oil was 0.7 per cent weaker
at $US78.48 a barrel.

The big four banks were mixed after a number of crossbench senators threatened to unravel the
government's plans to wind back elements of the Future of Financial Advice reforms.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 0.5 per cent to $80.54, while Westpac edged up 0.1 per cent
to $32.79. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group fell 0.2 per cent to $31.77, and National
Australia Bank dropped 0.7 per cent to $32.13.

Telstra shed 0.2 per cent at $5.75.

Woolworths fell for the eighth session in a row, down 2.2 per cent to $32.26, a day after UBS analyst
Ben Gilbert cut his recommendation from "buy" to "sell". "Aldi and Costco are gaining acceptance
and winning share at an accelerating rate," Mr Gilbert said.

Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, slipped 1.8 per cent to $42.89.

$602.5 million annual profit and announced the sale of its non-mining chemicals division to private
equity giant Blackstone for $750 million.

Building materials supplier James Hardie added 4.3 per cent to $12.52 as it showed a stronger than
forecast 66 per cent jump in interim net operating profit, despite a slower than expected recovery in
the US housing sector.

Nine Entertainment Co added 0.5 per cent to $2.06 as shareholders at the annual general meeting
were told to expect a more than doubling in first-half net profit.

Virgin Australia fell 1.3 per cent to 39.5¢ as the airline said it will strengthen ties with Singapore
Airlines frequent flyer program.
IPH Ltd, the holding company for patent attorneys Spruson & Ferguson defied the market gloom,
jumping 47.6 per cent on its ASX debut to $3.10.
