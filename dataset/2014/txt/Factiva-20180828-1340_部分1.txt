ASX-listed Cape Lambert Resources Ltd. has settled with Metallurgical Corp. of China Ltd. over the final
A$80 million payment from the sale of the Cape Lambert magnetite iron ore project in Western
Australia.

According to the July 14 statement, both the arbitrator and escrow agent have been advised to release
A$30 million to Metallurgical Corp. and the balance of about A$51.6 million to Cape Lambert.

Cape Lambert first launched legal action against Metallurgical Corp. in September 2010 to recover the
final payment for the 2008 sale of the project.
Metallurgical Corp. was ordered by the arbitrator in August 2013 to pay the A$80 million into an interest
bearing escrow account, and the money was deposited in late November 2013.

Cape Lambert expects to receive the funds within the week. It will then have cash, receivables and listed
securities to the value of A$100 million which includes unrestricted cash of A$70 million.

The Singapore International Arbitration Centre has been informed of the settlement and will immediately
issue a procedural order suspending the arbitrations, the company said.

Cape Lambert's board will now meet within the next two weeks to finalize a dividend or return of capital to
shareholders, it added.
