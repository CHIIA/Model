GWA Group, Australia’s leading supplier of building fixtures and fittings, has agreed to sell its Dux
Hot Water business to Japanese water heater manufacturer Noritz Corp for $46 million, finally
offloading the division after a previously proposed deal was called off.

GWA flagged in July that it was selling Dux Hot Water, as well as its Brivis Heating & Cooling
businesses, which had been identified as “non-core” after a strategic review.

The price of $46m, on a debt and cash-free basis, was in line with the book value of Dux Hot Water,
GWA said. Completion is expected next month.
Noritz is a leading manufacturer of water heaters for residential and commercial use. Greenstone
Partners, Deloitte and Clayton Utz advised GWA on the sale.
GWA was approached by Rheem Australia to buy Dux Hot Water, but that transaction was
questioned by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in October. The competition
regulator said an acquisition by Rheem would substantially lessen competition in the market.

GWA is switching its focus to bathroom and kitchen and door and access businesses, while
divesting some non-core units.
The company is also looking to sell its Wetherill Park vitreous china manufacturing site.BUSINESS
