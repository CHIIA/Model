The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close slightly higher.

Markets rose in Europe, the UK and US last night.

On the NYSE where 3203 issues traded there were 2,387 issues higher, 741 down and 75 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2735 issues traded there were 1,998 issues higher, 638 down and 99 unchanged.
Metals were mildly higher, crude rose, gold fell. The $A is at 91.26US c, up about 45 points from last
evening.

"For the day I will call us up 10 points'

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The interesting move that has caught everyone by
surprise is the $A which with all the talk of China's economy slowing was expected to weaken. Instead it
is in a short term uptrend, coming into resistance at 91.40US c which was tested last night. If we see
91.40US c broken it will be a bullish break out for the $A with 92.60US c potentially the next target.
"Gold, which was being bought up as a safe haven has topped out now at $1390 intra day on clear
evidence of profit taking. It is still within the short term uptrend, and still sitting above the 20 day moving
average of around $1343 which should be support for now. So long as $1343 holds for the week, the
uptrend remains in tact.

If it falls below that next week that could potentially bring a break of the uptrend.
"Copper is still stuck in its holding pattern and is consolidating. The $2.90/2.95 per pound level seems to
be holding.

"The S&P500 daily chart is again looking quite bullish short term and looks a lot more bullish than our
market. The S&P500 now looks set to run back and test previous highs. The next level of resistance looks
like 1883.

It has broken back above the 20 day moving average. 1860 needs to hold, with a close above there
needed to confirm positive momentum after the sell off.

"For the XJO, the intra day chart yesterday showed a downtrend. There was a good spike early on then a
shallow sell off for the rest of the day. There is some doubt whether our market will push forward from
here. It is good to see it close yesterday back above 5335, but we need to test 5350 - which failed to
break yesterday - and close above there.

"Resistance is still at 5350. For the bulls to get up steam it would need to close above 5375.

"5350 and 5375 are the big tests - a close above 5375 on Friday would be reasonably bullish for us short
term.

"Cracking down on fundamentally unfair potentially illegal HFT arrangements'

New York's attorney general Eric Schneiderman has called for curbs on services provided to
high-frequency traders.

In particular Eric Schneiderman highlighted services that allow traders to get faster access to information.

He said traders can make "rapid and often risk-free trades before the rest of the market can react".

"Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets are becoming too
focused on catering to them," said Mr Schneiderman.

"I am committed to cracking down on fundamentally unfair - and potentially illegal - arrangements”
