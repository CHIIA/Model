T he Queensland sex shop employee is understandably nervous talking about her industry's profitable,
but illegal, sideline. "I could get into real trouble for this. I'm pretty sure there's a corrupt policeman
involved who is tipping people off," she says, asking that her name not be used. "They're making tens of
thousands of dollars a week travelling down to NSW getting the stuff from postboxes just over the border.
Then they drive it north to where it is distributed among the adult shops. "The suppliers won't send it to
Queensland because they know it's illegal. That's why it comes to a postbox just over the border." They
call it a sort of aphrodisiac tea and it's sold under the counter, she says. This so-called "aphrodisiac tea"
is a synthetic cannabis, or cannabinoid, and the shop assistant's admissions provide a glimpse into the
rapidly evolving trade in "new psychoactive substances", or synthetic drugs, in Australia. During the past
five years, authorities have watched the lucrative trade explode and have been left struggling to deal with
the horrific fallout that has caused five fatalities in just over a year. In November, health authorities warned
Victorians to avoid synthetic drugs, particularly one called "Marley" after three users became seriously ill.
The three men who smoked it, after buying it from a Pakenham sex store, wound up in intensive care.
About the same time, Newcastle truck driver Glenn Punch injected a substance known as bath salts. He
stripped naked and jumped a fence before he started foaming at the mouth, had a fit and stopped
breathing. Less than a month later, NSW schoolboy Nick Mitchell, 15, died in his bedroom after taking
NBOMe - a synthetic substance supposedly designed to mimic the effects of LSD, but far more
dangerous. Other deaths have been linked to the same drug. This loss of life prompted outrage and
changes to laws. The Victorian government has slapped a ban on 10 synthetic drugs since 2011. But the
jury is out on whether the legal moves are working - experts say the drugs can be easily doctored to
circumvent the laws - or whether they have had an impact on the Mr Bigs of the trade. What is obvious is
that the business of "new psychoactive substances" (as the police call them) has rewritten the old rules of
the "highs" industry and turned on its head the paradigm of drug dealers, suppliers and users, while
generating millions in profits. Producers of the raw materials are not machinegun-toting Afghan farmers
or tattooed bikie speed cooks, they are white-coated lab technicians based in legally operated industrial
complexes in southern China, India and Pakistan, where they brew deadly substances designed to mimic
illegal drugs. The

chemical structures of the potions are engineered to fall outside existing laws in the buyers' countries, but
often the potions are illegal anyway. The buyers - the top-level dealers - are not gangsters, but often hip
young university graduates, whose operations turn over six-figure sums in days and who know more
about the structure of their personally ordered chemicals than the government chemists who regulate
them. Using the internet, these entrepreneurs advertise and co- ordinate their business online and use
slick marketing, packaging and incentive deals to attract customers using the "legal highs" tag. The local

the owner of the local sex or tobacco shop to naive teenage school students or mine workers and military
personnel trying to dodge drug-testing regimes. In the sex-shop case, the drugs are supposedly being
imported into Victoria, posted to northern NSW, then driven into Queensland to take advantage of the
variations in state laws. Governments, law-enforcement and medical authorities have been left scrambling
to implement major changes to procedures and laws in a bid to catch up. "It has been a wild, unrestrained
evolution that kind of came out of left field. You have a hierarchy of well- informed, chemically educated
people, who are speculating and commissioning the manufacture of novel products," says British

emergency medicine specialist David Caldicott, who has been studying the synthetic drugs in Australia
and Britain for years. "I get concerned because the rate of change is so fast that something big and ugly is
just around the corner." Caldicott is monitoring the new drugs via the emergency department of
Canberra's Calvary Hospital. His concerns are shared by the acting chief executive of the Australian
Crime Commission, Paul Jevtovic. "The reality is, we can't keep up," Jevtovic says. "The European
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has found that since 2011 we are seeing a new drug in
this category every week." An indication of the increasing amounts coming into Australia is to be found in
Customs seizure records. Last financial year, the agency recorded an increase of more than 1000per cent
in the size of seizures of synthetics. Until now, the source of the drugs and their distribution have been
difficult to track. However, information has started to trickle out of the first prosecutions under new laws,
which are yet to be tested in higher courts. In Queensland, one man was committed to face trial in
Brisbane District Court charged in connection with the alleged supply of a product that allegedly contained
alpha-PVP (alpha-Pyrrolidinovalerophenone), an analogue of the substance Methcathinone, which is
supposed to act like an amphetamine. District Court documents relating to a restraining order sought by
the
Australian Federal Police over the man and his company's assets reveal the company turned over
hundreds of thousands of dollars and allegedly supplied a network of adult shops and tobacconists. Much
of the money appeared to go to a NSW company that had been set up by a man from a wealthy Sydney
family. The NSW man cannot be named because he is facing charges. The same court documents reveal
a connection with New Zealand through credit card records associated with the Queensland company,
showing a transaction with a company from Christchurch. This NZ company has previously been known
to supply herbal products and other so-called relaxant substances. Efforts to contact the Christchurch
company were unsuccessful. It's not the only connection with New Zealand, which has recently
introduced laws that could see the legalisation of the drugs in a manner similar to the way medicines are
regulated. Before the laws come into force, sellers of the drugs can apply for an interim licence. One seller
that has applied for a licence is a company called Lightyears Ahead Limited, an Auckland operation that
was allegedly owned by the country's "King of Kronic", Matthew Wielenga. Kronic is a synthetic form of
cannabis and Wielenga earned his nickname through his promotion and selling of the synthetic drug prior
to its ban. His business has previously been linked to the so-called "father of legal highs", Kiwi rock star
Matt "Starboy" Bowden.

Bowden has boasted how he pioneered the trade in a legal and supposedly harmless party pill that
mimicked the effects of ecstasy - something he was able to sell for years before it was also banned by the
government. The profits appear to have made him a wealthy man, to the point where he and his former
Penthouse pet wife, Kristy, made headlines when they celebrated his 40th birthday with a $130,000 party.
Fairfax believes that at one point, Bowden supplied some products to Wielenga's operation but was not
directly involved in the Kronic business, and he denies any involvement or interest in selling the drugs to
Australians. In 2011, Wielenga allegedly branched into Australia and began selling other synthetic drugs
in Queensland through a company called Subliminal Marketing Pty Ltd, according to documents filed in
Queensland's Supreme Court. The same year, Queensland Police raided Subliminal Marketing's Gold
Coast operation and have since alleged the company was selling cannabinoid products intended to be
similar to already banned compounds and therefore in breach of the state's laws aimed at the new
synthetic drugs. Wielenga denies any impropriety. Authorities have sought a restraining order over the
company's assets, which include a $4million shopping centre. Several Australian entrepreneurs are trying
to mimic these profits while avoiding any illegalities. Fairfax has obtained an order form for various
substances that lists a company

allegedly owned and run by one of the pornography industry's major figures. Efforts to contact the man
were unsuccessful. One positive for police is that they believe organised crime has not been heavily
involved. But, Jevtovic says, "there are strong indicators that this is exactly the type of market they will
want to control". Suppliers of the engineered chemicals are thought to be openly operating legal labs in
Asian countries that don't regulate production of these chemicals, police say. "Most of the stuff is coming
out of China - if not all from China - and it can come two ways: already pre- packaged, or in a powder
form," says Detective Superintendent Nick Bingham of the NSW drug squad. "We have seen this a few
times, where a person buys the powder out of China and they mislabel it as white milk or something, and
they bring it here, mix it with acetone, and then spray it on an inert leaf, not in sterile conditions, and bag

Page108of276Â©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.it." Jevtovic says the ACC has seen evidence that the China-based suppliers have a significant influence
on the market, even to the point where the suppliers have told people how to evade detection at
Australian borders. David Caldicott says the key area is in Guangdong, in south-west China. "There's a
very big pharmaceutical concern based in that region that is making legitimate pharmaceuticals. But for
the same process, they can manufacture 100kilograms or so of something more speculative and turn a
nice profit," he says. Despite the producers being out of reach, Australian authorities believe the laws they
have introduced have been effective in starting to control the trade, with several arrests.

Detective Clay Butler, of Queensland Police, says that state's legislation refers to 35synthetic cannabinoid
compounds, but also has an extended definition of the dangerous drugs legislation that includes any
substance that is intended to have a substantially similar pharmacological effect to already banned
substances. "That's the one the industry doesn't like," he says. Butler says there are several cases before
the courts in relation to the new laws, but they are all yet to be decided. While Australian politicians are
establishing a new legal framework, others who work closely with the industry, such as Caldicott, believe
banning the drugs is not going to work. "There is this mythology about consumers who are pursuing the
recreational high that they must be dumb. You can't infer that assessment of their IQ from their behaviour.
Some of these people are incredibly clever and they have very detailed and sophisticated knowledge of
chemicals. They are chemists," Caldicott says. "What about euphoria. If someone gets happy eating
chocolate, are they going to ban it? People always find a way around it. That's why a knee-jerk approach
of banning products will not work in years to come. We need to be more clever and nimble."
