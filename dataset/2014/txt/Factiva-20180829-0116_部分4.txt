25 March 2014: K&L Gates Named Among Client Service "Power Elite"

Page10of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.[Company Release] Boston - Global law firmK&L Gates LLP has again been recognized for its superior
client service, earning a ninth-place ranking for the strength of its client service from a field of 650 law
firms in BTI's 2014 Client Relationship Scorecard released today. Based on surveys of more than 500
corporate counsel at Global 500, Fortune 1000, and billion-plus dollar companies, the report shows K&L
Gates outperforming more than 95 percent of the market serving large corporate clients in building and
maintaining client relationships, earning the firm a designation among the industry's "Power Elite"
category of most service-oriented firms. Through the survey, BTI asked corporate counsel across more
than 15 industries to identify - in an unprompted and unaided manner - their current law firms, also
evaluating the strength of their relationships with those firms and how well the firms consistently satisfy the
client's expectations. In addition to achieving one of the highest rates of Clientopia - defined by BTI as "the
ideal state of a client relationship where a law firm is both the leading primary provider and first firm
recommended to peers' - among all firms, K&L Gates also was identified by clients as a leading law firm in
nearly a dozen industries, including banking, chemicals, energy, financial services, high tech, industrial
manufacturing, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, professional services, retail trade, and transportation.
K&L Gates' ranking among the "Power Elite" follows other recent recognitions from BTI that have included
the firm being named for a second consecutive year among the top 30 law firms for client service in the
2014 BTI Client Service 30 report and noted as a "Powerhouse" firm in both the areas of Class Actions &
Torts and Securities & Finance Litigation in the organization's annual Litigation Outlook survey.
