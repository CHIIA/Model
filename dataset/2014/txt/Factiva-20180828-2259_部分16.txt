Mr. Ho, who has taken some of the most iconic photographs of Hong Kong in 1950s and 1960s, returns
to Hong Kong to celebrate also the upcoming worldwide release of his new book 'A Hong Kong Memoir',
and the accompanying exhibition in Hong Kong.
The Pottinger Hong Kong ('the Hotel'), under Sino Group of Hotels and winner of Asia's Best City
Boutique Hotel Award at World Boutique Hotel Awards 2014, collaborates with Mr. Ho to have 10 of his
masterpieces that depicts the heritage of Hong Kong, to be showcased in about 70 locations at
guestrooms and Gradini Ristorante E Bar Italiano in the Hotel.

The collaboration becomes fruitful after a 6-month discussion with Mr. Ho, who now resides in California,
USA, and it is the biggest scale commercial project that Mr. Ho has ever agreed to participate in.
Photography was chosen as the art form used at the Hotel as its location at Pottinger Street, a Grade I
historic site, is where early Chinese photography started in Hong Kong in late 19th Century.

Mr. Ho, now aged 83, has received over 280 photography awards in his long career. Between 1958 and
1965, he was eight times named one of the Top Ten Photographers of the World by the Photographic
Society of America. His style of photography has also earned him the nickname of 'The Great Master' and
'Henri Cartier-Bresson of Asia'.
The Hotel team also travelled to California in December 2013 to film a video documentary on The Great
Master's life, his philosophy on photography, and his journeys around Central Hong Kong when he took
those iconic photos in 1950s and 60s. The documentary is now being displayed at all guestrooms at the
Hotel to allow guests to have a better understanding of Mr. Ho's legacy.
"It is our great honour that Mr. Ho chose to work with us at The Pottinger Hong Kong, a hotel that
celebrates the heritage of Hong Kong, where East Meets West, and where heritage meets modernity,"
says Mr. Daryl Ng, Executive Director, Sino Group.
"Mr. Ho's photos depict the can-do spirit of Hong Kong, one that has characterised this city for many
generations," Mr. Ng continues. "We're delighted that Mr. Ho returns to Hong Kong first time in years, and
that he graced his presence at our Hotel."
Mr. Ho will attend several public events to meet his fans while in Hong Kong, including a book signing
session at The Pottinger Hong Kong on 30 November.
The Pottinger Hong Kong offers 68 luxury guestrooms and suites, ranging from 23 square metres to 68
square metres. The Pottinger Suite and six cosy suites, named after the streets around the Central
neighbourhood, feature a bespoke decor with a touch of oriental flavour and celebrates Hong Kong's
romantic rich heritage and reflects the wealth of its diverse culture. Room rate starts from HK$2,220.
