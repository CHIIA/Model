SYDNEY, Nov 27 (Reuters) - London copper edged up on Thursday from three-week lows hit in the
previous session on prospects that the European Central Bank could ease monetary policy and
cushion demand.

FUNDAMENTALS

* Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose by 0.3 percent to $6,590 a tonne by 0258
GMT. It fell to $6,556 a tonne on Wednesday, its weakest since Nov. 5.
* The most traded February copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange slipped by 0.2
percent to 46,790 yuan a tonne.

* U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in October but a measure of business spending plans fell for
a second straight month, suggesting some slowing in the pace of economic growth.
* China's central bank refrained from draining funds from the money market on Thursday, the first time
it held off from open market operations in four months, signalling its intention to keep borrowing costs
low, traders said.
* The European Commission presented a 300 billion euro ($375 billion) plan on Wednesday to boost
Europe's stagnant economy, but some doubted private investors would stump up the funds, 15 times
the EU contribution, needed to make it work.

* BHP Billiton's struggling Nickel West smelter in Australia lost out on a potential key source of nickel
when rival Jinchuan Group of China signed a purchase agreement with an Australian miner.

* Asian stocks inched higher on Thursday as the prospect of further stimulus from central banks in the
region and Europe eclipsed disappointing U.S. data, which tripped up the dollar.
