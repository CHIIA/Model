UGL deal agreed as rival trumps bid

By Angus Grigg and Lisa Murray

TD

A secret $7million payment to Hong Kong chief executive C.Y. Leung by Australian engineering
company UGL was agreed on the same day that a rival bidder trumped UGL's offer for his property firm
by about $184million. The higher bid was rejected and Sydney-based UGL bought DTZ for $177million
and is now selling it, with other assets, to United States private equity groupTPG Capital for about
$1billion. One condition of the $7.3million payment to Mr Leung, pictured, was that he ï¿½support the
acquisition of the DTZ group by UGLï¿½, according to a letter outlining the agreement. The letter does
not mention the rival bid. But an administrators' report into DTZ after the sale mentioned a rival
ï¿½confidentialï¿½ offer that valued DTZ at roughly $184million more than UGL. The other bidder was
later revealed as China's state-owned Tianjin Innovation Financial Investment Company. The higher bid
from Tianjin was rejected by the DTZ board, which included Mr Leung, who ran DTZ's fast-growing Hong
Kong and China business. DTZ's creditors agreed with the decision and deemed the bid too risky
because it would have taken eight weeks to complete and required shareholder approval. Two bankers
who worked on the deal confirmed that they believed the offer from Tianjin was superior. ï¿½We felt we
had a better offer,ï¿½ said one banker who declined to be named. ï¿½It was very frustrating at the
time.ï¿½ Another banker said: ï¿½The seller [DTZ] had the ultimate right to decide who the winning
bidder was.ï¿½ Concerns about the bidding process were raised by London's Daily
Telegraph in 2012. The paper quoted a source close to the Chinese company saying that ï¿½DTZ
sacrificed value to get the deal with UGL doneï¿½. "The Chinese offer was significantly better for
everyone, for employees, the shareholders and the creditors,ï¿½ the paper said. At this time, the secret
payment from UGL to Mr Leung was not known.
A spokesman for UGL said the company had no firsthand knowledge of any higher offer. ï¿½UGL
negotiated and entered into the agreement with Mr Leung to protect UGL's commercial interests in North
Asia by preventing him from competing with DTZ or employing DTZ staff for two years following UGL's
acquisition of the subsidiaries of DTZ Holdings plc,ï¿½ UGL said.

It said the general offer to Mr Leung was made almost three weeks before the December 2 letter that
sealed the payment, which has been referred to Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against
Corruption. The city's Department of Justice has also asked its director of public prosecutions to decide
ï¿½whether any prosecution against any persons is warrantedï¿½. The Australian Federal Police has
been asked to investigate. The disclosure has put further pressure on the embattled Mr Leung, who is
grappling with the largest pro-democracy rallies seen in Hong Kong. The demonstrators are demanding
China give them a greater say in elections scheduled for 2017and are calling on Mr Leung to resign - a
demand he has repeatedly rejected.
