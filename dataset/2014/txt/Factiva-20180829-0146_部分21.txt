Jones Lang LaSalle's Australian boss Stephen Conry says he is "very optimistic" about commercial
property markets in 2014 after posting record 2013 full-year profits for the fourth year in a row.

Australian investment sales revenue lifted 72 per cent over the year to December driving a 12 per
cent rise in overall revenues and a 25 per cent lift in full-year profits.

This was off the back of Australian commercial property transaction volumes reaching a record
$22.9 billion in 2013.
Deals negotiated by JLL in 2013 include the sale of half shares in six Federation Centre malls to
Challenger for $602 million and the sale of 567 Collins Street in Melbourne to Investa for
$462 million.

Revenues rose strongly across research and consulting, industrial sales, valuations, facilities
management and more than doubled across the health and aged care and student accommodation
division.

"It's our fourth year of record results, which were even better than we expected and very encouraging
for us and the wider market," Mr Conry said.

"We expect investment sales activity to be very strong in 2014 and for the office leasing market to
improve from its low base.

"We are in a situation where multiple buyer groups are engaged: offshore investors, A-REITs,
wholesale funds and superannuation funds."Low confidence dragging leases

Mr Conry tipped the student accommodation sector as a growth-spot with JLL estimating there is
currently over $1 billion of potential investment looking to enter the Australian market.

The weak spot in 2013, both in Australian and in the region, was office leasing.

Regional revenue fell 6 per cent over the year to $US178.9 million ($203 million) with corporate
clients "hesitant to make new commitments".

Mr Conry said rising business confidence would translate into better demand for office space this
year.

"2014 will see an improvement over 2013 for office leasing markets but there will be below trend net
absorption."
The Australian division reported its results alongside the Chicago-based group reporting its global
results. Fee revenue rose 12 per cent to $US4 billion for the year to December 31, with earnings per

$US848 million led by China, with broad-based revenue growth recorded across the region.

Operating income increased 18 per cent to $US77 million with fee margins rising from 8.4 per cent to
9.1 per cent.

Mr Conry said prospects for the global economy were stronger in 2014.

"Corporate America is hiring and this has translated into positive net absorption and lower vacancy
rates across a number of gateway cities in the US," he said.
