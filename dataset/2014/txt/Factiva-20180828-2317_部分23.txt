2320 GMT [Dow Jones] Macquarie Group (MQG.AU) has had a good start to the year but upside looks
harder from here, says Deutsche Bank. "Whilst MQG delivered a strong 1H15 result which exceeded
guidance, we find it difficult to see material upside to earnings and ROE in the near term with the strong
1H15 results aided by some positive one offs and capital intensity increasing from regulatory pressures
and growth," says Deutsche Bank. "This lack of upside surprise together with a fair valuation is likely to
limit near term share price performance." The broker has a A$61.00/share price target on Macquarie,
below the stock's recent trade of A$61.78. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com; @beckthurlow)

2315 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate near-term as long as it stays above Friday's
low of $79.55, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the MACD
indicator is bullish, but the slow stochastic measure is turning bearish, while the five-day moving average
is meandering sideways. Resistance is at $81.27 (Friday's high); a breach would be near-term positive,
exposing upside to $82.09 (Thursday's high), then to $82.88 (Wednesday's high, near middle 20-day
Bollinger Band), $83.15-$83.26 band (Oct. 22 high-Oct. 21 high), $83.48 (Oct. 20 high) and $84.45 (Oct.
17 high). But a drop below $79.55 would tilt the near-term view negative, targeting $79.44
(more-than-two-year low hit Oct. 27), then the lower 20-day two-standard deviation Bollinger Band (now
at $78.14), $77.28 (June 28, 2012 swing low) and $74.95 (Oct. 4, 2011 swing low). December crude is
down 13 cents at $80.41/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@wsj.com)
2302 GMT [Dow Jones] After Macquarie Group's (MQG.AU) 35% 1H profit rise exceeded the company's
own guidance, Bell Potter says Macquarie's guidance for full-year earnings remains conservative.
Announcing the interim result Friday, Macquarie stuck to its previous guidance that FY15 net profit would
be slightly up on the A$1.27 billion profit recorded in FY14. After analyzing Macquarie's outlook
statement for each operating group, Bell Potter says the company's guidance for the annuity-style
businesses are "ultra-conservative given their respective strong underlying fundamentals" including
assets under management growth, improving global equity markets and operating scale. The broker lifts
its price target slightly to A$67.00, from A$66.40, citing stronger return-on-equity momentum in the
annuity-style business, and maintains its buy rating on the stock. (rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com;

2244 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian stocks are poised for a moderately positive open, with SFE Futures
up 0.1%, after U.S. stocks rallied Friday on the Bank of Japan's decision to further stimulate its economy.
The news was priced in to the Australian market in the final hour of trading Friday, meaning the bourse
probably won't come close to the 1.1% jump recorded on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Westpac
also reported a strong full-year result on Monday morning, which should lend broader market support,
says Chris Weston, a strategist at broker IG. Local investors will be taking cues from Chinese
manufacturing data due later Monday. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
2237 GMT [Dow Jones] Weakness in the Chinese official PMI report at the weekend has seen the
Australian dollar open lower in Asia Monday, continuing the weakness from U.S. data strength on Friday,
said ANZ in strategy note. It adds the U.S. ISM report should maintain strength keeping pressure on the
Australian dollar and supporting the U.S. dollar. Locally, retail sales data Tuesday will provide the best
directives for the Aussie dollar for direction. The expected range is US$0.8630 to US$0.8830. Now
US$0.8759. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

response to a sharp fall in the Australian dollar to its lowest levels seen in 2014 so far. The Australian
Industry Group Australian Performance of Manufacturing Index increased by 2.9 points to 49.4 in
October from September, indicating conditions were very close to stable across the sector. A reading
below 50 indicates the sector contracted. The survey showed new orders, production and stock levels
rose in October, with the food and beverages industry leading the increase. Still, the data suggests
further recovery is needed before manufacturing becomes a strong source of job creation within the
economy. AIG Chief Executive Innes Willox said "conditions remain patchy." (james.glynn@wsj.com;

2216 GMT [Dow Jones] While the quality of Australia & New Zealand Banking Group's (ANZ.AU)
earnings and lending book continues to improve, its stocks are still too expensive, says J.P. Morgan,
which keeps an underweight recommendation, while lifting its price target to A$36.39/share from
A$36.08. "We continue to expect overall revenue growth to remain subdued in the mid-single-digit
range," the broker says. ANZ was last at A$33.50. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)
2114 GMT [Dow Jones] Bell Potter cuts its price target for BC Iron (BCI.AU) by 38% to A$1.80/share,
saying investors need a healthy appetite for risk following a dreadful quarter featuring disruptions at its
Western Australian mines. "With a market capitalization and enterprise value of A$196 million and
A$118 million, respectively, BC Iron is trading at a similar value to other iron ore explorers/developers
listed on the Australian Securities Exchange," the broker says. "At these levels, BC Iron represents
cheap iron ore leverage, with a 10% change in our price estimates, leading to a 40-50% change to our
valuation." As BC Iron ramps up annual production back to 6 million tons, the miner should generate
positive operating cash flow, Bell Potter says. Still, the broker says risks to its buy call include persistently
weak iron-ore prices and widening of pricing discounts. BCI last traded at A$1.075.

2204 GMT [Dow Jones] Regis Resources's (RRL.AU) strong start to FY15 is a big step toward rebuilding
confidence shaken by problems including flooding at its Western Australian mines and a hefty writedown
against projects including its McPhillamys gold deposit in New South Wales state. Still, J.P. Morgan says
it prefers the risk-reward balance offered by rivals Alacer Gold (AQG.AU) and OceanaGold (OGC.AU).
The broker retains a neutral call with A$1.80/share price target. Regis produced 89,000 ounces of gold
in the three months through September, up 35% on the previous quarter, to beat J.P. Morgan's forecast
for 81,000 oz. "Nonetheless, we remain concerned about the history of operational issues at Garden Well
and Rosemont that have challenged our confidence in the company's assets," J.P. Morgan says. RRL
last traded at A$1.38. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
2139 GMT [Dow Jones] Forsyth Barr lauds Ebos Group's (EBO.NZ) strategic acquisition of BlackHawk
Premium Pet Care -- which provides a direct investment into the growing premium pet food category in
Australia. It also grows Ebos' exposure to the animal care sector, characterized by above GDP growth
and attractive margins, it says. Forsyth Barr expects the acquisition to be EPS accretive from FY15.
However, with Ebos trading at a small PE discount to the market, it retains a neutral rating and a
12-month target price of NZ$10.40. The share is +0.3% at NZ$9.60 early in New Zealand.

2136 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/JPY remains well supported after the BOJ stunned markets by
announcing an increase in the pace of its assets purchases, says BNZ FX Strategist Raiko Shareef. The
pair is at 87.6475 and Shareef says BNZ is currently forecasting it will be at 0.85 by the end of the year,
however, given that BNZ will have to adjust its USD/JPY forecast as a result of Friday's news, NZD/JPY
will also be marked higher. (rebecca.howard@wsj.com; Twitter: @FarroHoward)

2134 GMT [Dow Jones] OceanaGold (OGC.AU) is in a solid position to beat its FY14 production target,
says J.P. Morgan, which also finds a lot to like in the company's revised mining plan for its Didipio
copper-gold deposit in the Philippines. OceanaGold's strong 3Q output means it only needs to produce
24,000 troy ounces of gold in the final quarter of its fiscal year to meet the top end of its full-year
guidance of 85,000-95,000 oz. The broker also says the revised plan for Didipio means underground
mining will now start in 2017, meaning it can access ore with better grades of gold earlier. "With the
stock price well below our discounted cashflow-based valuation, and given the potential for the
development of Blackwater (which is not in our valuation), strong balance sheet and leverage to copper
prices, we remain overweight," J.P. Morgan says. OGC last traded at A$2.00, offering 53% upside to the
broker's revised A$3.05/share price target. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
