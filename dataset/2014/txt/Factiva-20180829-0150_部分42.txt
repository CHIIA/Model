OZ Minerals and Newcrest Mining received very different reactions from the market yesterday,
despite both offering up some hope to beleaguered investors in quarterly results.

OZ shares rallied almost 15 per cent from a low base, closing the day up 43¢ at $3.50 on the back of
its quarterly results. Managing director Terry Burgess said copper and gold output at its Prominent
Hill mine was towards the upper end of a revised annual production guidance, and flagged a reduction
in costs at the flagship mine, in South Australia. In the 12 months to December 31, OZ produced
73,362 tonnes of copper and 128,045 ounces of gold.

Despite its once-mighty cash balance falling further in the quarter, down to $363 million, Mr Burgess
dismissed some market commentary of growing pressure on OZ’s balance sheet and said there was
no need for the com- pany to sell its 18 per cent stake in Sandfire Resources.

Mr Burgess said analyst models showing OZ burning through its remaining cash this year were
factoring in a low copper price. “We’re still very happy with the copper price,” he said.

“There are a lot of people out there saying $US3.50 (per pound) for 2014, which is a very bullish view
of copper. We will be smiling if that occurs over the year.”

Newcrest received a different reaction to a similar announcement, however. Its shares fell 27¢, or 3.1
per cent, to $8.53 after saying production at its suite of mines, including Telfer in the Pilbara, was on
track to meet the upper end of a 2.3 million-ounce target for the financial year.
Chinese-controlled Norton Gold Fields won the tick of approval from investors for its December
quarterly result, with shares up 1¢ to 14¢, albeit on light volumes.

Norton said a push to improve output and lower costs was on track, though it reported a 2000oz dip in
quarterly production from its Paddington mine near Kalgoorlie-Boulder, to 42,616oz.

Norton said average C1 cash costs fell $17 to $883/oz in the period, though its disclosed total
production costs rose slightly compared to the September period. The company attributed the
increase to an “amortisation expense due to more tonnes milled than mined”. At $1188/oz Norton’s
total production costs were well below the $1784/oz recorded in the December 2012 quarter.
‘We’re still very happy with the copper price.’” OZ Minerals managing director Terry Burgess
