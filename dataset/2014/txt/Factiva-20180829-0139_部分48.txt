QGC has continued its investment in the Chinchilla region with the purchase of a huge site for
its new logistics hub in Surat Basin Industrial Park.
SBPG CEO Jason van Hooft said the decision by QGC to invest heavily in Chinchilla and set
about developing a hub was a major vote of confidence in the area.

“The site they have purchased is at the entry to the industrial estate and involves three lots with a
total area of approximately two hectares,” he said.

“The site is suitable for a large industrial building, and storage facilities.”
Mr van Hooft said the site, which industry insiders tipped to have sold for about $2 million, would
provide a base from which QGC would service all its Surat Basin gas operations.

Surat Basin Real Estate selling agent Bruce Holmes, who clinched the deal, said he expected to
see more large companies following QGC’s lead.

“Inquiry for industrial land and tenant ready industrial facilities has increased considerably over
the past six months and we expect that momentum to continue in 2014,” he said.
