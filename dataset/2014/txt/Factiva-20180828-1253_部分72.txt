DARREN Rathbone runs three of Australia’s most successful wine brands — Yering Station, Mount
Langi Ghiran and Xanadu — but even he has been taken aback at the colossal challenge of cracking
the mythical Chinese export market.
Mr Rathbone, the managing director of Rathbone Wine Group, has a message for mining magnate
Andrew Forrest and others seeking to massively boost Australian agricultural exports: it takes years
of on-the-ground effort even to begin to understand the whims of China’s consumers.

The wine boss’s bid to engage with Chinese consumers extends to establishing his own distribution
company in China several years ago, employing a Mandarin speaker at the cellar door at Yering
Station in the Yarra Valley and hosting dinners in Beijing and Shanghai.

Mr Rathbone welcomed Mr Forrest’s initiative to establish a partnership to market Australian
agricultural produce to China under a single brand, with the aim of establishing Australia as China’s
preferred long-term supplier. “If we can focus on quality production and supply to the top end of
Chinese demand, we can do that really well,” he said.

“But the idea that we are the food bowl of Asia and we’re going to be able to produce enough food to
feed 2 or 3 billion people, that’s not the direction we should take.” Mr Rathbone cautioned against
predictions that China would prove a saviour for Australia’s wine industry, which is still suffering from
depressed prices caused by an unprecedented grape glut and a high exchange rate.
The downturn has hit the Rathbone Wine Group particularly hard, causing Mr Rathbone’s father
Doug to sell almost his entire stake in crop protection group Nufarm earlier this year to slash the debt
load of the family company. The dramatic share sale signalled that the family’s future is focused for
now on stabilising its wine businesses.
The most recent data on Australia’s wine exports to China showed a steep 12 per cent decline in
annual sales, which industry observers attributed to locals staying away from up-market hotels and
restaurants amid a government-led austerity drive.
Despite this, China remains Australia’s fastest-growing export market and is viewed by many as the
holy grail for local wine producers.
“There’s been a lot of talk across the industry that China is going to be the magic bullet for Australian
wine — I think that’s a bit naive,” Mr Rathbone said.
“There isn’t a fast track. People say ‘if we can only get 1 per cent of China drinking wine every day it
will solve the world’s wine glut’.
“That is not understanding the Chinese culture and it’s not understanding what they are likely to do.”
He said Rathbone Wine Group was the first Australian company to establish its own distribution
network in China but its brands remained little-known outside Beijing and Shanghai and French wines
remained far more popular among well-heeled consumers.

Part of it is that a lot of Chinese have come into wealth and the French brands were the most
expensive and they’ve equated price with quality in the same way they’ve gone for Louis Vuitton or
Gucci.” He said his company was now focused on examining consumer behaviour and educating
Chinese drinkers about wine.

Mr Rathbone was speaking after Xanadu’s 2011 Stevens Road cabernet sauvignon was named
Australia’s wine of the year — beating 9000 others — at the James Halliday Wine Companion
Awards last week.The respected wine critic gave the Margaret River wine a rating of 99 out of 100.
