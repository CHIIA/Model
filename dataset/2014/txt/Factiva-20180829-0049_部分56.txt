CLOSES A TOUCH LOWER/FLIGHT INTO BONDS ON RBA MINUTES

Our market closed down 11.6 points to 5400.7, after trading in a narrow band all day, exactly as
expected. Volume was high at $3.9 billion and trade in individual stocks, including at the smaller end,
was lively - and not biased to the sell side or profit taking before year end.

Meanwhile Aussie bond yields fell 9 points to 3.69% and the $A dropped 60 points on last evening to
93.52US c following the RBA minutes of its last meeting which was very different in tone, and seemed far
more worried than in recent times - signalling possible rate cuts ahead.

*Banks and miners each contributed a little over 6 negative points to the index.
*Woodside was the story of the day after Shell sold all but 4.5% of its remaining 23% stake, part of it in a

Echo Entertainment gained another 8c to $3.06 on 18.9m shares and Atlas Iron rose 1.5c to 58c on
21.2m shares ,despite the fall in the iron ore price to below $90 for the first time since 2012.

At the smaller end, among major movers, PanContinental rose .5c to 3.6c on 88.2m shares, no
immediate news sighted.

In the wider market, there was bad news everywhere!

*The Baltic Dry Index fell to a one year low, with Japanese shipping stocks weaker - but also signifying
lower demand for bulks.
*Meanwhile China's markets fell after numbers out today that revealed foreign direct investment had
dropped 6.75 in May from a year earlier, the most since January 2013 and vs a 3.2% gain expected by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
*Bloomberg also reports Standard & Poor's in a report dated June 15 said borrowers from China had
$14.2 trillion in debt at the end of last year, exceeding every other country including the US which had
$13.1 trillion in company obligations, according to a report dated June 15 by Standard & Poor's. Needs
of Chinese issuers will increase to $20 trillion through the end of 2018, a third of the $60 trillion in global
