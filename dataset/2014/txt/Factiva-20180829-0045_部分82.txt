China's Baosteel Resources and Australia's Aurizon have further increased their shareholding in Aquila
Resources, raising their joint holding in the company to 25.49% at the end of last week, from 24.23%.
In early May the Chinese behemoth and Australian freighter tabled an unsolicited A$1.4 billion ($1.3
billion) takeover offer for Aquila, which the Australian miner initially resisted on the grounds the
A$3.40/share offer undervalued the company.

On June 18, however, Aquila advised its shareholders to accept the offer after the termination of
discussions with Australia's Mineral Resources about a rival takeover bid and Baosteel's previous
announcement that it would not increase its offer price or extend the acceptance period beyond July
11.

Aquila Chairman Tony Poli, who holds 28.92% of, had previously said he intended to accept the
Baosteel-Aurizon offer in the absence of a superior proposal. "He is likely holding off selling until the
latter stages of the expiry period, in the hope a superior proposal emerges," a market source said
Monday.

Baosteel and Aurizon need a 50% minimum acceptance from Aquila's shareholders, and if successful
Baosteel would then hold 85% of Aquila with Aurizon holding the remaining 15%. Both companies
would also take control of Aquila's stake in the 30 million mt/year West Pilbara iron ore project, which
is a 50:50 joint venture with American Metals & Coal International.
