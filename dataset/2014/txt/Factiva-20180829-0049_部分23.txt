UD Trading’s Singapore unit is looking to hire seven ferrous and non-ferrous traders and the company
also plans to open offices in Europe and Australia, Dhaval Shah, UIL Singapore director, told Metal
Bulletin.

UIL Singapore wants to hire four non-ferrous traders and three ferrous traders, with UD Trading looking
to hire five more traders across London, Dubai and Australia.
Shah expects to set up a trading team in Sydney within the next 6-12 months. In Europe, the company
is yet to zero in on a location. The trader has a representative office in London.

“We started with two employees [in Singapore] and now we are a team of 14 employees. We have plans
to grow bigger in the near future,” he said.

“Metal trading companies are shifting their base to Singapore, which is a financial hub and one of the
busiest ports,” he said, adding, “The big guys – miners, traders, manufacturers and end users – have
their marketing and sales teams in Singapore.”

“We will continue utilising our funds to capture growth opportunities in emerging markets and increase
market share in the metals industry,” Shah said.
“UIL [Singapore] has emerged from 2013 a stronger, better and higher earnings company, maturing
new businesses and commodities like nickel, aluminium, copper, tin and zinc,” Shah said.
UIL Singapore’s profit after tax rose 75.25% year-on-year to $7.08 million in the year ended March 31,
2014. Revenue rose 59.3% to $490.73 million in the period.
The company’s non-ferrous trading includes copper cathodes, copper, scrap, copper wires and rods,
and nickel cathodes, nickel briquettes, ferro-nickel, aluminium scrap, aluminium ingot, zinc ingots, brass
ingots, chrome and tin.
Its ferrous trading includes raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal; flat steel products, including
hot rolled coil (HRC) and cold rolled coil (CRC); and long steel including bars and wire rod; as well as
billet and scrap.
UD Trading (UDTH) is held by the UD Group, which has businesses in trading, mining and industrials
activities and power generation.
As of the last financial year, UDTH had a revenue of $2.4 billion and profit after tax of $46.5 million
UDTH has complete stake in UIL Singapore, UIL Hong Kong, UIL Dubai and a 5% stake in Ushdev
International Ltd.

Eventually UDTH intends to integrate as much of the trading group under its portfolio as possible, Shah
said.
