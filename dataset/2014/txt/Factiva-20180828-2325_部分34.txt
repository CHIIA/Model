EXCLUSIVE CASHED-up Chinese buyers have tripled their spending on Queensland real estate,
farmland and commercial property since the global downturn, outlaying a record $462 million last
financial year.
The Chinese almost doubled their real estate spending in the Brisbane City Council area during
2013-14, to a record $185m — up from $96m the previous year.

China is now the biggest source of foreign investment in real estate in Queensland, the only state
or territory to track purchases by offshore buyers.
On the Gold Coast, where property prices plummeted during the global financial crisis, Chinese
buyers topped the list of foreign buyers by snapping up $196m worth of property during 2013-14 —
5.9 per cent more than 2012-13.

Americans were the most active foreign investors in Brisbane, spending $244m last financial year —
up 60 per cent in 12 months.
But Chinese buyers almost doubled their expenditure in Brisbane, to $185m. Singaporean investors
bought property worth $97m and Malaysians spent $32m.
In the tourist city of Cairns, Chinese investment nearly halved to $4.5m but Singaporean investment
rocketed from just $890,000 in 2012-13 to $11.5m during 2013-14.

The Asian investment surge is detailed in the latest annual report of Queensland’s Foreign
Ownership of Land Register Act, which reveals Chinese investment was too low to show up in the
ranking of the six top investors at the start of the financial crisis in 2008-09.
Within a year, however, Chinese buyers had spent $150m on Queensland property, ranking third
behind Korea and Singapore.
China’s expenditure of $463m in 2013-14 was 43 per cent higher than the 2012-13 result, which
had been inflated by the sale of the nation’s biggest irrigator, Cubbie Station, to a Chinese
consortium for $240m in January last year.

The federal parliamentary standing committee on economics is investigating whether foreign
investment is fuelling Australia’s property prices.

The head of the committee, Liberal MP Kelly O’Dwyer, has flagged imposing an application fee for
offshore buyers to finance a Treasury crackdown on illegal purchases.
She has criticised the Foreign Investment Review Board for failing to enforce its restrictions on
foreign buyers, who are banned from buying established residential property.

visas and foreign students, can buy an established home as long as they sell it when they leave.
Immigration Department data provided to the parliamentary inquiry reveals that Chinese investors
have put tens of millions of dollars into real estate through the “significant investor’’ visa scheme.
It shows that 90 per cent of the scheme’s applicants are Chinese, and 8 per cent have put their
money into managed property funds worth $27.5m. The department is considering applications
from 610 migrant investors, offering to invest $3 billion.

The significant investor visa waives the points test and English-language requirements for migrants
who will invest at least $5m in Australia for four years.
They cannot spend the money directly on buying property, but can invest in managed funds or
property development companies.

The parliamentary committee was due to report last week, but the inquiry has been extended for
another six weeks.

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Steven Ciobo, has declared that planning controls
and a shortage of housing — rather than foreign buyers — are to blame for property price rises.

Housing prices in Sydney have soared by nearly 15 per cent in the past year, according to data
compiled by RP Data.Prices jumped 8.5 per cent in Melbourne, 5.1 per cent in Brisbane, 5.5 per
cent in Adelaide and 3.6 per cent in Perth.
