Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" says, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract up 12 points.

"The blueprint that I have been working since late February is that of a multi-week pullback back to 5180
to 5220 points before a final advance to a marginal new rally high.

"At present, I have pencilled in circa 5500 points by mid-April or mid-May for the top.

"While it is possible the final act could be postponed again, this does not change the fact that the internal
top for our market was April-2013.

"With each new rally high, both price and internal momentum continue to wane.

Page84of311©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."Unless the bulls can initiate a new wave of buying, the rally should run out of fuel shortly with a multi-year
bear market back to circa 4300 to follow.

"But none of this matters for today. The ceiling will be 5390. The floor will be 5345. When the dust has
settled, the market will have closed at 5364, down 2.9 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 16.8 points to 5366.9 last evening.

*The Housing Industry Association reported sales of new homes in Australia jumped 4.6% in February
from January on strong demand for detached houses, an industry survey showed on Monday, the latest
sign that low interest rates are fuelling a revival in the market. It is the highest in almost 3 years.

Sales of new detached houses surged 6.9 percent in February, while the volatile multi-unit sector dropped
6.8 percent.

"Both sales and building approvals for detached housing are signalling faster momentum ahead for this
component of new dwelling construction, compared to what was evident in the first phase of the
recovery," said HIA chief economist Harley Dale.

"This signal suggests more balanced growth ahead in the composition of new home building and adds a
further positive dimension to the recovery for many of Australia's manufacturers and suppliers."

*The Reserve Bank reported Australia private sector credit rose 0.4% in February.
