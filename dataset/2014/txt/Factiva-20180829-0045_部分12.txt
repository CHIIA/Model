Japan's Itochu Corporation has formed a joint venture with China's Tewoo Group to handle iron ore
imports and sales. The jv, named Tewoo-ITC Global Trading, is 51% owned by Tewoo Group and 49%
owned by Itochu, according to a release by the Japanese trading corporation on Tuesday July 1. Total
investment in the project is about $30 million, according to Itochu. This is the first time that a Japanese
trading company has tried to sell iron ore in partnership with a Chinese state-owned trading company,
Itochu said. The new venture will procure iron ore and other minerals through Itochu's overseas network,
and take advantage of Tewoo Group's domestic processing facilities and sales network in China. Itochu
and Mitsui collectively hold a 15% interest in BHP Billiton's Western Australia Iron Ore mine, rail and port
infrastructure, which has a capacity of 220 million tpy.
