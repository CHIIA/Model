A Derwent Valley farming property, the historic Norton Mandeville, has sold for $6.5 million to a
Tasmanian farmer.

The 2154ha Gretna property, on the Lyell Highway, has 8km of frontage to the River Derwent and
includes a 410sq m five-bedroom sandstone home built around 1820.

It previously sold in 2007 for $8.1 million to a US investor, a record for a rural property in the south of
the state.
Sold through Adelaide-based agency Colliers International, the property consists mainly of substantial
irrigation, cropping and livestock.

The first owner was Governor William Sorell, Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen’s Land from 1817 to
1824.

The property overlooks the Wellington Range, River Derwent and valley, Mt Field and Central
Highlands peaks.

“This transaction is a standout in a tough Tasmanian market,” Colliers International agent Tim
Altschwager said.

“It is a highly diversified agricultural holding with a major livestock production focus, substantial
irrigation entitlements and infrastructure with potential for further development, quality accommodation
and structural improvements.” Mr Altschwager said the productive property had garnered attention from
a variety of prospective buyers.
“We had parties looking at the property for dairy conversion to take advantage of the extensive water
entitlements, as well as Chinese investors looking to break into the market because they like the
Tasmanian brand,” he said.“It’s a positive sign to see the local buyers getting back into the market,
demonstrating growing confidence from domestic investors.”
