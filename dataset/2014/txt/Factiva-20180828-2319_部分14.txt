Equities

A mostly optimistic tone to the annual general meeting season, including well-received updates from
AMP, ResMed and Qantas, spurred shares higher on Friday to ensure a second straight week of
gains.

Over the past week, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index and the broader All Ordinaries index each
lifted 2.7 per cent, to 5412.2 points and 5399.3 points respectively, in a broad-based recovery led by
the big four banks. On Friday, the market added 0.5 per cent, again led by financial services.
"Long term, the outlook for the Australian equity market remains solid, so it is important investors
look through the recent increase in volatility," HOSTPLUS Super chief investment officer Sam Sicilia
said.

However, the fund has been reducing its allocation to local shares over the past month to free up
capital to deploy towards better opportunities in unlisted assets and global equities, he said.

In local economic news, official September quarter inflation data released on Wednesday saw
headline inflation fall to 2.3 per cent year-on-year. Economists said the soft result supported the
Reserve Bank of Australia's stance to keep record low interest rates on hold for some time to come.

It was the big four banks that did the most to lift the index over the week, as all rose before the bank
reporting season. National Australia Bank rose 3.4 per cent to $34.27, ANZ Banking Group lifted 3.4
per cent to $33.02, and Westpac Banking Corp also gained 3.4 per cent to $34.21. Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, which reports on a different calendar to its main rivals, was up 2.9 per cent to
$78.77.

Telstra Corporation rose 2.2 per cent to $5.50 over the week. At its AGM on Thursday, Australia's
dominant telco conceded it expects profit margins to shrink while outlining its plans to push into Asia.
The miners were also stronger, despite a dip in iron ore prices, as data released in China on
Tuesday showed marginally stronger than expected economic growth.
Resources companyBHP Billiton finished the week 1 per cent higher at $33.74. On Wednesday its
US oil and gas division smashed forecasts to show a 49 per cent surge in quarterly production. Rio
Tinto gained 1.2 per cent to $60.05.

New products used in the treatment of sleep disordered breathing, which is associated with snoring,
boosted ResMed's sales in the first quarter.

The result suggest some long-awaited new releases are proving popular, which halts a period of
sluggish growth and sets the sleep therapy giant up for a strong year, analysts said.

share price up 6.5 per cent on Friday. The stock closed up 35¢ to $5.72, down from a 12-month high
of $5.90 hit last September.
AGL Energy was a laggard, down 1.2 per cent to $13.51 as its AGM on Thursday was marred by
protests against its coal seam gas projects. Transfield Services was the best performer of the week,
surging 27.3 per cent to $1.91 amid a $1 billion takeover approach from Spain's Ferrovial.
