Australia's small resources companies index is trading at levels below those during the depths of the
global financial crisis, despite a stronger than expected iron ore price and positive returns from the
larger resources companies.
Lower commodity prices, project financing issues and uncertain demand from China for raw materials
helped drag the Australian Securities Exchange Small Resources Index down 41 per cent in the past
year to 2209, marginally lower than where the index fell in November 2008 when the market dived
during the United States subprime debt crisis.

The index, which includes Whitehaven Coal, Beadell Resources, Western Areas and Oceanagold
Corporation, is trading 68 per cent lower than its five-year high of approximately 7000 at the start of
2011.

However, shares in the world's largest resources companies, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, are trading
slightly higher than at the same time a year ago.
Morningstar senior equity analyst Gareth James said the index performance is justified given the poor
track record of many of the companies within the index, and the medium-term outlook for major
commodities.

Morningstar found that more than 91 per cent of resources companies with a market capitalisation of
under $100 million were loss-making in the 2013 financial year. More than three-fifths of resources
companies valued at between $100 million and $500 million failed to register a profit over the same
period.

"You saw huge gains in share prices leading up to the GFC and then post GFC as well, but you didn't
see the earnings per share growth at the same time," Mr James said.

"If you can't increase your earnings per share then your share price may go up in the short term, but in
the long term it will be difficult to sustain those gains. You could say the index has been smashed, but
the real question is have these mining companies cleaned up their act? Are they profitable? Are they
operating viable business models?"Gold price a contributor
The spot gold price has been a major contributor to its performance given the large number of
companies that comprise the index. Gold has fallen 26 per cent from $US1692 an ounce in January
last year to about $US1242 an ounce on Monday, raising the risk of more write-downs by Australia's
goldminers. Alacer Gold, Evolution Mining and OceanaGold Corporation were all trading more than 35
per cent down over the past 12 months. However, the spot iron ore price has traded much stronger
than expected over the past few months at $US135 a tonne.
Chinese steel mills traditionally reduce the amount of iron ore purchased in the second half of the
calendar year, leading to a weakness in the spot price, but the steel-making material's price has traded

12-month low of $US110 a tonne at the end of May last year.

Most experts previously predicted the spot price to fall to $US100 a tonne and further as additional
supply hit the global market and demand waned.
CIMB research found China's Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute is forecasting
higher imports in 2014 and 4 per cent growth in steel production, which should underpin the iron ore
price this year.
