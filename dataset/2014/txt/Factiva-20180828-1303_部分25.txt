Cyprus office LJ Hooker has taken up an interest in Cyprus to open up the Mediterranean island’s
property listings to Australian buyers.
The company this week announced its new agreement with Cyprus real estate group Fox Smart
Realty.

Russian, Chinese and English investors have already been drawn to the island, LJ Hooker says, and
Australian investors are being enticed by its similar banking system and proximity to Europe, Africa and
Asia.

LJ Hooker’s Bill Russell said the referral agreement was a “strategic alliance” for the brand. It adds to
other international agreements with Siam Real Estate in Thailand and Hamptons in England.

“Cyprus’ banking and legal system is modelled on the British system, which has increased the appeal of
property for investors,” Mr Russell said.
“Property prices are still down in the wake of 2012-13, offering exceptional opportunities for Australian
investors.” Agent ranking THE top 100 agents list has been released by industry portal Real Estate
Business, produced by Sterling Publishing.
According to Sterling director Phillip Tarrant, Australia’s Top 100 Agents sold more than $9.3 billion in
residential property in 2013-2014, an increase of $3.6 billion on the previous financial year. Nine WA
agents made it onto the list, with Acton Dalkeith’s Vivien Yap leading the charge at number 5
($145,868,800). She was followed by Bev Heymans, Acton Cottesloe (rank 33, $101,632,050), Michael
Keil, michaelkeil.com, Belmont (43, $90,158,359), Scott Swingler, Space Real Estate City Beach (68,
$98,602,333), Tonia McNeilly, TM Residential Dalkeith (69, $84,929,000), Justin Davies, Space Real
Estate Cottesloe (74, $91,892,500), Brendon Habak, Realestate88 East Perth (76, $60,635,228),
Michael Forzatti, One Residential Palmyra (92, $56,651,000) and Susan James, Space Real Estate
Claremont (95, $66,599,000).
