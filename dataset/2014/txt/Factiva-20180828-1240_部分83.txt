Sydney (Platts)--20Aug2014/441 am EDT/841 GMT (Updating with detail and analyst comment)
Woodside Petroleum, Australia's largest listed oil and gas producer, Wednesday said record production
of 46.5 million barrels of oil equivalent had helped it post its highest-ever interim net profit of $1.105
billion.

The company, which is the operator of the North West Shelf and Pluto LNG projects in Western
Australia, also reported record operating revenue for the first six months of 2014, at $3.551 billion, up
24% on the corresponding period of 2013. The increase reflected higher realized prices due to the
transition to a new pricing regime for Pluto LNG, and higher sales volumes, mainly on the back of an
entire half of production from Western Australia's Vincent oil field, which came back online in the fourth
quarter of 2013, and increased reliability at Pluto and the North West Shelf.

"Pluto pricing re-negotiation has delivered improved LNG realizations [in the first half] although most of
the upside has now been captured in results," Hong Kong-based analysts at Bernstein Research said in
a note. "Pluto LNG average realized prices improved 18% year on year to $11.6/Mcf."
Woodside's net profit for the half was 27% higher year on year. The company said the rise was
supported by higher prices and sales volumes, the lack of impairment losses and lower exploration and
evaluation expenses.
Underlying net profit for the half was up 33% on 2013 at a record $1.136 billion.

The record first-half production, which was 11% higher year on year, was "a testament to our assets'
ongoing reliability," according to Woodside CEO Peter Coleman. Subsequent to the end of the first half,
Woodside has raised its 2014 production target to between 89 million boe and 94 million boe, from the
previous 86 million boe to 93 million boe.
Bernstein expects Woodside to produce 92 million boe in 2014. "In our view, production will flatten off in
2015 at 92 million boe and beyond," the analysts added.

"Our international exploration strategy is taking shape, with new acreage in Myanmar and our entries into
Morocco, Tanzania and Gabon just subsequent to the end of the half-year," Coleman said. "We continue
to only pursue those opportunities where we see value for our shareholders."

Woodside has resumed exploration drilling in Australia, making a gas discovery with its Toro-1 well in the
offshore Exmouth Sub-basin. Drilling has also begun in the frontier outer Canning Basin off Western
Australia, targeting multi-Tcf gas prospects.

Meanwhile, Woodside said it was on track to make a decision to move into the front-end engineering and
design phase for its Browse floating LNG project off Western Australia in the second half of this year. The
Browse project involves the development of 14.9 Tcf of gas in the Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa fields
using up to three floating production facilities, each with capacity of about 3.9 million mt/year of LNG and
22,000 b/d of condensate.

Woodside has said previously it was targeting a final investment decision on Browse in the second half of
2015, although Bernstein noted signs "that this is slipping." First gas would be expected five to six years
after FID, which the analysts are now tipping will come in mid-2016 at the earliest.

its Browse equity LNG before FID, although that was not a pre-requisite. He added that "marketing
activities are actually progressing pretty well" in the company's target market of Japan.
Elsewhere, the company has signed a sole proponent agreement with the government of British
Columbia to access land at Grassy Point to undertake feasibility studies for a potential LNG project.
"With limited organic growth near term, we believe Woodside will be tempted by M&A to boost growth
options," the Bernstein analysts said. "Woodside have stated in the investor briefing earlier this year that
any investment should be a strategic fit with ideal investment size in the range of $1 billion to $5 billion,"
they added.
