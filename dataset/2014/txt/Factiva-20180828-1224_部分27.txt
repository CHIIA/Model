A dividend extravaganza failed to spark a fresh rally on the Australian sharemarket, with investors
unconvinced by the growth picture painted by companies during reporting season.

For the month, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.1 per cent to 5625.9. Over the final week it slipped
0.4 per cent and on Friday it was flat.

The broader All Ordinaries was flat in August, down 0.3 per cent for the week and up 0.1 per cent on
Friday.

During the final week of the month, the S&P 500 crept above 2000 for the first time on the back of
increased confidence in the recovery of the world's largest economy. Coming into August, Australian
investors were hoping for strong revenue growth to help justify valuations after a relatively strong run.

Headline profits have been reasonably good, but much of the extra money has largely come from
cost-saving, rather than improved sales. "Generally, there wasn't spectacular growth, obviously there
were a few stars, in top-line sales, unless there was benefit from acquisitions," Patersons Securities
strategist Tony Farnham said.

"The top-down angle is showing growth at below trend, the consumer is still a little bit cautious on
spending, although that seems to be picking up – that might be to the benefit of the results of the
current half-year and full-year, but that's water a little further upstream that we haven't seen yet."
Iron ore reached a fresh two-year low in the final week of August. The metal has fallen 8.7 per cent to
$US87.30 a tonne over the month. Concerns about the lack of demand for steel from China's property
sector bubbled to the surface. However, unlike in June, when iron ore was at similar levels, the
Chinese government is not expected to inject stimulus into the economy.
BHP reported a $US13.4 billion ($14.3 billion) full-year underlying profit while also announcing the
$15 billion demerger. Rio Tinto impressed the market with a $US5.1 billion underlying half-year profit.
Australian iron ore miner Fortescue reported a massive 56 per cent jump in profit to $US2.7 billion.
But BHP shares fell 5.2 per cent in August to $36.67 and Rio dropped 5.7 per cent to $62.63.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia was the only bank of the big four to report full-year earnings, hitting a
record profit of $8.6 billion. ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank issued quarterly updates. ANZ hit
profit of $5.2 billion in the nine months to June and NAB lifted third-quarter profit to
$1.7 billion.Winners and losers

The results, while solid, disappointed investors. There are concerns about weak credit growth and the
impacts of David Murray's financial systems inquiry moving forward. CBA shares finished 2.9 per cent
lower for the month, but the stock did trade ex-dividend. ANZ fell 1.6 per cent to $33.43 in August,
while NAB dipped 0.3 per cent to $35.20.

traditional dividend players continued to please the market. People say the buy-in on stocks for income
is getting a bit tired, and it is. But it's still there at this stage," Mr Farnham said. Telstra rewarded its 1.4
million shareholders by announcing not only an increased dividend, but also a $1 billion share
buyback. The announcement came as the telco reported a 14.3 per cent increase in full-year profit to
$4.3 billion. Telstra shares hit a 12-year high during August, finishing the month up 1.3 per cent at
$5.56.
Wesfarmers was another major company to open the cookie jar for investors, announcing the return of
$1.1 billion to shareholders. The funds will come from the sale of its insurance business earlier in the
year. Shares ended August down 1.4 per cent at $43.31. "All the strategists out there haven't changed
their numbers that much for this year because of reporting season. They might have nudged them a
little bit lower, but there were some optimistic calls out there for where the market was going," Mr
Farnham said.
Among notable losses were the two big airlines. Qantas reported a full-year net loss of $2.8 billion,
and an underlying loss of $646 million. The net loss included the non-cash $2.6 billion write-down of
the value of its international fleet. Rival Virgin Australia also reported a net loss of $355 million and an
underlying loss of $211 million. Virgin shares finished the month 2.5 per cent higher at 41.5¢.
