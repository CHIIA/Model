The S&P/ASX200 is down 25 points to 5511.1 at midday on good volume worth $2.1 billion. There are
369 issues higher and 466 down. The SPI Futures is down 19 points to 5514 on light volume of 9172
contracts. Aussie 10 year bond yields are down 1 point to 3.92%. The $A is at 92.38 US c, down about 20
points on early levels.

*The banks have contributed 5.5 negative points to the index, insurers have contributed 0.6 negative
points, resources have contributed 9 negative points, property trusts have contributed 0.5 positive points,
retailers have contributed 3.6 negative points and Telstra has contributed 0.2 positive points.

*The Nikkei Dow is closed on holiday. Shanghai CSI physical is up 1.17 points to 2004.66, Hang Seng
futures is down 19 points to 22,138 points. S&P futures is up 1.2 points to 1867.2, Nasdaq futures is up
4.25 points to 3545 points, Dow futures are up 11 points to 16,408 points. Spot gold is steady at $1296.
Crude is up 4c to $100.88.
Our market has again teetered on either side of flat all morning, as uncertainty on Ukraine, China (the
official manufacturer PMI is due out shortly - iron ore prices were sharply lower last night), our Budget and
the usual tax loss selling ahead of the June close off weighs on investors.

"For today, I expect the market will rise about 20 points'

"Maree" said, "It looks today as if we will have a gain on the market.

"There has been a lot of focus on Australia's (lower) growth. We have not made new highs like the rest of
the world, we have factored in a lot of this slowdown. We have factored in China's slowing. A lot of the
negatives from the forthcoming Budget have also been factored in - we expect it will be in deficit, may be
another 5/10 years.

"While the $A is too high for manufacturing exporters and others, the Aussie dollar at current levels keeps
inflation restrained. If the $A was weak the RBA would probably be forced to lift interest rates - and we
know the level of debt for households is alarmingly high. I don't think a weaker $A would get us out of
trouble.

"Meanwhile, we have the 4th largest level of funds under management in the world.

"For today, I expect the market will rise about 20 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed at 5536.1, up 5.1 points last evening.

*MSB: Japan progress/Prochymal Phase 3 trial for Crohn's disease to resume

Mesoblast Ltd advised in an update on its clinical programs using the product Prochymal acquired as part
of the entire culture expanded mesenchymal stem cell business of Osiris Therapeutics that the key aspect
for the acquisiton was the potential for early and significant revenue streams using Pro chymal, the world's
firstapproved allogeneic stem cell therapeutic and the only allogeneic stem cell therapeutic designated by
the US FDA as both an Orphan and Fast Track product.

Page136of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Mesoblast will meet with teh US FDA shortly to discuss potentia lpathways for accelerated Prochymal
product approvals for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD. In Japan, Mesoblast collaborator
JCR Pharmaceuticals is expanding its manufacturing facility to prepare for the commercial launch of its
MSC product JR-031. The product was granted orphan drug status in December 2013 and as a result will
be subject to an expedited review.

Mesoblast expects to have a read out of the end of the year on whether the primary endpoint of day 28
remission in Crohn's diseaase biologic-refractory patients has been achieved and whether there is
evidence of efficacy in high risk groups.

(Osiris had announced positive results from a pilot Phase1/2 in 2006 for Prochymal in treatment of patients
with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

A Phase 3 trial had followed, with a pre-determined futility analysis resulting in temporary cessation of
recruitment. MSB now intends to complete this Phase III trial).

Coles managing director Ian McLeod said the comparable sales growth was pleasing, particularly given
the restrictions on fuel discounts from January 1 2014 and against the strong comparative sales achieved
in the same period last year.

Wesfarmers managing director Richard Goyder said the retail sales performance was similar to last year,
particularly considering the impacts of an Easter that fell in March last year.

target of $41.23. the broker said Coles like for like growth is expected to moderate to up 2.7% like for like
with Bunnings to remain strong, up 5.3% like for like, Kmart to remain subdued with Target weakness
remaining.
Resources prices continue to fall (the broker forecasts $US120/tonne for the hard coking coal price) and
said it retained an "underweight" due to valuation.
*WES: Coal production up on pcp, MDL 162 to be progressed

Wesfarmers Ltd in its quarterly statement of production, development and exploration said at Curragh
overburden removal was 9.8% lower than the previous quarter due to a planned 11 week major dragline
shutdown commencing in February.
Coal production was 3,205,000 tonnes (comprising 2,375,000 tonnes of metallurgical coal and 830,000
tonnes of steaming coal), 9% higher than the previous quarter due to improved plant performance during
the quarter.
For the 12 months to March 31 metallurgical coal production rose 8.2% to 8,382,000 tonnes with the prior
comparable period impacted by a scheduled shut down and wet weather associated with Cyclone Oswald
in early 2013. On the development front, in January 2014 the resources division acquired Mineral

Page137of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Development Licence 162. MDL 162 is located between and adjacent to the Curragh and Curragh North
mining leases with the acquisition to augment the total base of coal reserves potentially available for
mining and processing at Curragh's coal handling and preparation plants. The additional coal reserves
are expected to extend Curragh's mine life and provide future options to further optimise mine operations.
A feasibility study has commenced with respect to potential future development of MDL162.
Wesfarmers share of coal production at Bengalla (WES 40%) was 948,000 tonnes for the quarter, up
18.9% on the previous corresponding quarter due to operations in a more productive section of the
mining sequence.

various actions over the years, the Fin Review today reported administrators from McGrath Nicol said they
were faced with an inefficient and ageing manufacturing plant dating back to 1935 describing it as a "highly
distressed business' starved of cash.

number of weeks before the administrators could confidently say that it had been fully stabilised. NAB is
owed $56 million and Westpac $55 million. There are unsecured creditors owed $14 million while the
180 employees are collectively owed $4.5 million in employee entitlements.

*VXL: Graphite sales commence - first Australian graphite sales in over 20 yrs
Valence Industries announced it has sold its first graphite, the first sales in Australia for over 20 years.
Shipments to Japan are to commence in the coming weeks.

Uley Graphite from reprocessed material will be used for applications ranging from industrial lubricants and
refractories to battery applications.

Valence Industries' Phase 1 Re-commisisoning program continues.

(Our note: The Uley graphite resource is 1.9Mt indicated and 4.5Mt inferred in high grade flake graphite at
a 3.5% graphitic carbon lower cut off grade with metallurgy confirming high process grades. It produced
graphite for export from the 1800's up until 1993.

The mine is located on the southern Eyre Peninsula within 22 km of Port Lincoln with established regional
support infrastructure and multi modal transport facilities.

Eagle Bay Resources had earlier struggled to commence production from Uley Graphite for many years,
later changed hands several times.

July 26 1999: flake graphite upto 95% pure carbon has been produced.

CRA had previously estimated the mineralisation at Uley to be 387m tonnes at

7.4% graphite. While on care and maintenance, additional exploration
indicated a new in situ indicated resource of 1.5 million tonnes at 15.3%

graphite providing a 50% lift in head grade, giving at least a 10 year mine

life.
The company is confident that acceptable marketing arrangements with

Japanese trading houses can be re-established.

In July 1999 research carried out by Eagle Bay together with the South Australian Mines

Department and the CSIRO have produced during laboratory a HiC Graphite

(99.9% carbon) from the low value fines discarded during coarse flake

processing.
