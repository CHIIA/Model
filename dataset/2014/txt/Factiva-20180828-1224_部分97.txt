Iron ore explorer Gindalbie Metals has taken out a $428 million three-year loan from China
Development Bank and Bank of China to provide Karara Mining with working capital support.
The loan follows the news earlier in the month, when Gindalbie flagged a $640 million hit to its
Karara investment, of which it holds a 47.8 per cent stake.

AnSteel holds the majority 52.2 per cent interest in Karara.
In a review of its assets, Gindalbie said Karara had been hit by capacity restrictions, a low iron ore
price and a higher than anticipated Australian dollar, which led to the impairment.
Ansteel provided a $60 million loan to Karara last year and retains an option to extend its stake in
the project to 62 per cent if it provides $230 million in working capital.
Gindalbie said it drew down an initial $107.1 million on the new loan.

Gindalbie's share price fell 2 per cent to 4.9 cents per share at 11:35am.
