Chinese-controlled gold miner Focus Minerals has paid $600,000 to settle a native title claim for
its mothballed Laverton operations.
The Wongatha people had been seeking as much as $1.3 million in royalty payments dating back
to 2007 when the Laverton operations fell under the control of Crescent Gold.

Crescent, which Focus acquired for $60 million in 2011, signed a land access agreement with the
Wongatha people in March 2005.

Focus said it received a letter in March this year from the NEIB Aboriginal Corporation, acting for
the Wongatha people, and the parties settled the matter last month.

NEIB, which stands for North East Independent Body, has also been in discussions with rare
earths miner Lynas over tenements at its Mt Weld mine near Laverton.
The Focus claim was revealed in the company’s half-year report, which shows it booked
impairments of $6.12 million for its Coolgardie operations in the six months to June 30.
Coolgardie and Laverton were closed last year amid sky-high operating costs and the gold price
crash as Focus haemorrhaged money.
China’s Shandong Gold, which completed a $225 million share placement in 2012 to secure a
stake worth 49.5 per cent, watched the value of its investment collapse, with Focus’ cash position
at the end of the June quarter standing at $92.2 million.

The half-year report also reveals Focus sold The Mount underground mine to contractor Lukah
Mining for $750,000.

The deal was brokered last month and announced to the market on September 9 for an
undisclosed sum.
Chairman Jisheng Lu, who is based in Jinan in China’s Shandong province, reveals in Focus’
half-year report there were “a number of offers” for The Mount and “several rounds of negotiations”
with potential buyers.

The Mount, near Widgiemooltha, was deemed a “non-core” asset by Focus because it was 70km
from the company’s mothballed Three Mile Hill processing plant at Coolgardie.

Focus has also sold its 200-person camp on the edge of the Laverton town site to Rakkan for
$900,000.
The camp has been on care and maintenance since the Laverton operations were shuttered last
year.

in the June quarter.
The main push was at the Brilliant deposit at Coolgardie, where the company sees strong potential
for an underground mine, although a restart still appears a long way off.
