Partners in Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill project continue to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the
iron ore project, despite a debt financing on the project taking longer than expected to complete.
The latest downpayment on the project totalled $330.8 million, with the majority of that coming
from Ms Rinehart's international partners POSCO, China Steel Corporation and Marubeni.

POSCO purchased a further $70 million in its own right, while a holding company set up to
manage equity from all three of the international partners – known as KJTC – put in a further
$247 million, according to documents obtained by ASIC.
The latest instalments mean the partners have chimed in more than $US1  billion ($1.1 billion) for
the project in the past four months, after making more than $600 million of investments in the
September quarter, and just less than $300 million in mid-January.
While close to $US3 billion worth of finance was offered by Korean and US export credit agencies
in December, a further $US4 billion has not yet been finalised. The project is scheduled to be
exporting its first iron ore in just 20 months from now.

Fairfax Media revealed on Wednesday that Roy Hill had made alterations to its prime construction
contract in recent weeks, including an agreement to push back the completion date on the contract
by 46 days to the brink of 2016.
