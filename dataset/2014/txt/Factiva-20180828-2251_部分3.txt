Billionaire developer Harry Triguboff has brushed off suggestions Meriton is pushing ahead with a
sale of its apartments business to Chinese interests following the launch of a brand new corporate
identity on Monday. A new logo will see Meriton's famous crown removed with a new "M" evoking the
peaks of residential towers and "new heights of success".

"The brand update was considered to better reflect the sophistication and quality of the Meriton
product," Meriton said in a statement.

Asked if the change was about repositioning the brand to better fit Chinese corporate culture,
following much speculation there could be a tie up with Country Giant, Mr Triguboff said: "We only
have one direction: up."
The company is celebrating the biggest year in its history, topping off a record $431 million in land
acquisition and becoming Australia's largest home builder.
An internal Meriton valuation has the company's assets at about $7.3 billion. But advice from Grant
Samuel has them at closer to the $12 billion mark, based on a multiple of 10-times earnings.
