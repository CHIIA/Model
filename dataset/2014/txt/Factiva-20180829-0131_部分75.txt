MINING giant Rio Tinto has delivered a larger than expected full-year profit and dividend despite the
price of most of its products falling.
Rio’s profit last year was up 10 per cent on the previous year to $11.52 billion, above analysts’
expectations of $10.85 billion.

Net profit, which included impairments, was $4.13 billion.
The world’s second largest iron ore producer also met a promise issued by chief executive Sam
Walsh a year ago to boost shareholder returns and slash debt.

Shareholders will receive a dividend of $2.15 dividend a share, up from $1.85 a year ago.
Net debt was at $20.2 billion, down $4.5 billion from last June.

Massive cost cutting drove the profit growth, with falls in the prices of most of its commodities —
with the exception of iron ore — hurting earnings by $1.45 billion, despite record production.
Rio cut operating cash costs by $2.55 billion, exceeding its target of $2.25 billion.
Mr Walsh said the company had made “very real progress” and delivered “stunning” results.
Mr Walsh rejected talk there would be large falls in the iron ore price and predicted strong global
economy — in China and developed countries.
Rio reduced its workforce by 4000 people and another 3300 workers left with the sale of
businesses.
The profit was an improvement from a $3.35 billion loss in 2012.
