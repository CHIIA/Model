"Bit soft early and finish up about five/next reasonable leg has to be a down leg"

"Bernborough" said, "We are being led more by Asia at present - I expect us to be a bit soft early and
finish up about five, but a lot will depend on Asia.

"People currently don't know what to do - they are not even doing rotations (from one sector to another)
because there's not enough movement.

"I am all cashed up and want to go short, because I believe the next reasonable leg has to be a down leg,
but I've not enough confidence to do anything right now".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 10.9 points to 5295 last evening.

"ZA News" in Johannesburg reported yesterday "The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa said
BHP Billiton Ltd may sell its Bayside aluminium smelter, which the world’s biggest miner has earmarked
for closure, to Hulamin Ltd.

secretary for the KwaZulu-Natal province, said today by phone, referring to Hulamin, a manufacturer of
finished aluminium products.

"BHP plans to cease smelting at the Bayside operation in the northeastern port of Richards Bay, it said in
a January 17 statement, citing “significant and ongoing financial pressure.” Lulu Letlape, a spokeswoman
for BHP Billiton, and Johannes van Niekerk, a spokesman for Hulamin at CapitalVoice, declined to
comment when contacted by phone today".

Shell sells its Wheatstone gas and 6.4% LNG to Kuwait Co for $US1.14 bln cash

Dalje.com (English version) and various Aussie newspapers report Royal Dutch Shell said it would sell its
interest in an Australian gas field to the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. for $1.14 billion in
cash.
"Shell will remain a major player in Australia's energy industry. However, we are refocusing our
investment to where we can add the most value with Shell's capital and technology, said Shell Chief
Executive Officer Ben van Beurden, Dalje reported.
This follows Shell's warning last week that earnings in the fourth quarter would be about $2.2 billion lower
compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, a drop of about 70 percent.
The company blamed slim refining margins and increased spending for the profit warning.

In Australia, margins are lower due to high labor costs, the Journal said.
In the $1.14 billion deal, Shell is selling its 8 percent share of the Wheatstone-Iago gas field and its 6.4
percent interest in the Wheatstone liquefied-natural-gas project in Western Australia.

Shell will publish its 4th quarter results on January 30.

*South Africa's platinum producers have been served with a strike notice by the Union.

*Codelco is said to be seeking funds from the new government, with its spending plans at risk, Reuters
reports.

*GUD: GUD reports for the half year.

Analysts expectations: $20.4 mln, no div.
Company guidance: On January 15 GUD Holdings Ltd announced plans to relocate the production
capacity of its Kings Park (Sydney) Dexion Industrial pallet racking factory to newer and lower cost Dexion
factories in Malaysia and China. The board has determined this to be necessary to improve Dexion's
competitiveness in Australia. Dexion will retain sales, design and installation and customer support teams
in Australia.

The decision to cease manufacturing in Australia will involve a staged closure of the Kings Park factory
during 2014 with redundancy of up to 75 positions. The total costs associated with the project to relocate
manufacturing are $15.9 million and includes the writedown of obsolete and surplus plant and equipment
for $3.2 million, $4.2 million in new capital expenditure and $8.5 million in closure costs of the Kings
Park factory. The writedown and costs will be brought to account in first half results, to be announced on
January 21 2014.

It is expected the project will be completed by December 2014 and is expected to realise an annualised
cost reduction of $67.5 million after that.
