VENDETTA MINING CORP. CLOSES THE PEGMONT PB-ZN-AG PROPERTY TRANSACTION AND
$2.25 MILLION PRIVATE PLACEMENT
Vendetta Mining Corp. has received final TSX Venture Exchange approval for both its previously
announced option deal on the Pegmont lead-zinc-silver deposit in Queensland, Australia, and its
concurrent private placement (see news release dated Aug. 11, 2014).
The company has initiated the payment of the initial option payment of $250,000 (Australian) to
Pegmont Mines Ltd. (the vendor) and the reimbursement of $300,000 (Australian) in exploration
expenditures by the vendor that were incurred to meet minimum Queensland Ministry of Mines required
work commitments for the current year during the negotiation period. The company will be completing
quality assurance/quality control checks, and the results will follow.

The Pegmont lead-zinc-silver deposit is located 25 kilometres east of BHP Billiton's world-class
Cannington silver-lead-zinc mine and 28 kilometres north of Chinova Resources' Osborne copper-gold
mine. It is proximate to existing infrastructure that includes roads, railhead and natural gas for power
generation.

The company has closed its oversubscribed non-brokered private placement for aggregate gross
proceeds of $2,249,980.46. The company issued units at 26 cents per unit. Each unit in the private
placement is composed of one common share and one-half of one share purchase warrant, with each
whole warrant exercisable into one additional common share at a price of 35 cents until Aug. 27, 2017.
In connection with the private placement, the company has paid cash finders' fees to certain finders for
an aggregate amount of $46,982.44, which is equal to 8 per cent of the total subscription amount of the
number of units introduced by the finders to the company.

All securities issued in connection with the financing will be subject to a four-month hold period expiring
on Dec. 28, 2014.
