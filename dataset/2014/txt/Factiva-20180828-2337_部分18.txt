A new $100 million deal between Bega Cheese and a Chinese retailer will result in more work for
Shepparton’s new Pactum UHT dairy factory.
While Bega has two factories in northern Victoria and is an exporter of milk powder, it does not pack
UHT milk, so it will engage the Pactum plant officially opened in May.

Bega has signed the agreement with Chongqing General Trading Group in southern China.
The Chongqing municipality in south-west China has a population of 32 million.

The signing of the Chongqing agreement represents an expansion of Bega’s products entering the
Chinese market.
The Bega brand has been sold in China since 2000 and Bega Cheese, through its wholly owned
subsidiary Tatura Milk Industries, has been a major Australian exporter of high value milk powder,
infant formula and cream cheese to the Chinese market.
