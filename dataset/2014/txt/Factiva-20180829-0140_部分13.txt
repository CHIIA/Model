Sydney - Monday - February 03 (RWE) - Condor Blanco Mines Limited (ASX: CDB) has today made a
share placement at $0,008 to a fund managed by Beaufort Securities Limited, a leading UK corporate
broker.
The fund is backed by a boutique UK mining investment consultancy.

** Heads of Agreement have been completed for integrated debt funding and development project
acquisition.
Condor has completed Heads of Agreement for 10 million in debt finance.
The finance is to be committed to fund two projects to development: The "Marianas" Iron Ore Project
and the newly right to acquire "The Duel" Hard Coking Coal Project.
** The Duel Hard Coking Coal Project in South Africa covers part of an already drilled seam of coal.

The license sits between two already drilled licenses adjacent to it on the east and west.
Under the agreement, Condor can acquire a majority stake of up to 50.3% of The Duel and a set of
nearby projects.

The position of The Duel project makes it a clear take- over target for adjacent mines, which are
already under development.

** A more detailed technical summary of The Duel is being prepared and will be distributed as an
appendix with Condor's upcoming annual newsletter.
