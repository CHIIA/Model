2341 GMT [Dow Jones] Strong organic growth helped
IOOF (IFL.AU) deliver a tidy fiscal 2014 result, with its
normalized profit of A$123 million beating Bell Potter's
forecast by 1.2%. "Coupled with market gains and an
accretive transaction, we can see IFL outperforming the
market over the medium-term." Bell Potter retains a buy
recommendation and lifts its target to A$10.30/share
from A$9.30 after increasing its EPS estimates by 5%
for FY15 and 5.2% for FY16. IFL last traded at A$8.95.

11:40 GMT [Dow Jones] Sims Metal Management Ltd.
(SGM.AU) may have missed expectations with its FY14
profit, but "management provided enough clarity on the
result briefing call to alleviate some of our concerns
around the 13% volume decline in the U.S., and
deterioration of Australasian earnings between
1H-2H14," J.P. Morgan analyst Keith Chau says. He tips
a substantial increase in earnings this year, estimating a
31% lift in EBITDA. This is reliant, though, on a
considerable improvement in underlying market
conditions in North America, Chau says. He also thinks
positive catalysts for the stock are largely priced in, so
downgrades to neutral from overweight with a A$12.35
target. SGM last traded at A$12.08.

2338 GMT [Dow Jones] Aluminum distributor Capral
(CAA.AU) finally looks to be in the right place at the right
time, says Bell Potter analyst Jonathan Snape. For the
past four years, Capral has been burdened by weak
residential construction markets, a high Australian dollar,
falling aluminum prices and rising aluminum premiums.
"There are now signs that the majority of the negative
drivers of reversing and this combined with the
integration benefits of the recent OSA acquisition are
what drive our buy rating and A$0.19/share target
price," Snape says. Last week, Capral said its 1H net
loss narrowed to A$2.1 million in FY14. Bell Potter also
noted that trading ebitda of A$2.6 million was ahead of
past guidance of up to A$2.3 million and its own
forecast of A$1.5 million. CAA last traded at A$0.14.

early trading after the S&P 500 backed away from an
all-time high Friday. IG predicts S&P/ASX 200 will open
down a couple points at 5636 and notes the fall in the
iron-ore price is likely to play on investors' minds. The
benchmark still couldn't break above 5650 Friday,
although it did manage a fresh six-year closing high of
5645.6. "It looks like bears are defending positions
above 5650 vigorously," IG market strategist Evan
Lucas says. Lucas adds many stocks will be trading
ex-dividend over the coming 10 trading days, which
could prove a drag on the overall market. Market
heavyweight BHP Billiton's (BHP.AU) U.S. ADR fell
0.9%, setting the tone for trading in Australia.

2316 GMT [Dow Jones] What's Bega Cheese (BGA.AU)
to do with its cash? Bell Potter notes the company's
balance sheet is in a healthy position and can
adequately fund investment in supply expansion and
new capacity, with surplus cash still remaining.
Consolidation remains a desire but there's also the
scope to release surplus franking credits that now total
A$23.6 million and could support special dividends, Bell
Potter says. It retains a hold recommendation and
A$5.43/share target after BGA's FY14 underlying profit
was broadly in line with expectations. BGA last traded at
A$5.25. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2313 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY may trade in a
103.50-104.50 range with bias on the upside after Fed
Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that should consumer
prices and wages rise, the Fed could increase rates
sooner than the mid-2015 timeline the market expects,
says Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in
Tokyo. "Her comments at Jackson Hole were balanced,
and took into consideration the positions of the more
hawkish members of the Fed," he said. Mr. Ishikawa
says the pair's next resistance is at 104.50, where thick
selling offers are seen. "Stop-loss orders will be
triggered once this level is breached," he says. He tips
the EUR/USD at 1.3150-1.3250. The USD/JPY is at
104.19 and the EUR/USD is at 1.3197.

2309 GMT [Dow Jones] J.P. Morgan holds a neutral
rating on Spark (SPK.NZ), formerly known as Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand, as the company is trading above
its 12-month target price of NZ$2.65. The company is
currently trading up 0.7% at NZ$2.88. It adds that
scepticism about the turn-around strategy seems to
have evaporated judging by the share price strength
removing a catalyst for re-rating. It adds that it still sees
risks in the fixed line business but "in a sector which is
trading at full valuations in our view, Spark yield support
and balance sheet flexibility limit the downside."

2258 GMT [Dow Jones] RBC Capital Markets says
Santos's (STO.AU) latest gas-condensate discovery in
the Browse Basin offshore Western Australia state is
good news, but development is likely to be slow. On
Friday, Santos said its Lasseter-1 exploration well had
struck a 405-meter net gas-condensate column and that
testing had indicated 78 meters of net pay. "With

Page182of416©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.uncertainties on the Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AU)
Browse project, the entry of Origin (ORG.AU) into the
Poseidon project, the collapse of Bonaparte FLNG and
the strong potential for that project to be used as
Darwin-LNG backfill gas, the Western Australia
development opportunity may be long-dated and highly
competitive," RBC says. The broker rates Santos at
sector perform, with a A$16.00 price target. STO last
traded at A$15.16. (david.winning@wsj.com;

10:49 GMT [Dow Jones] AMP's (AMP.AU) valuation is
again moving back toward the relative premium it used
to hold as a relatively safe, stable stock, says J.P.
Morgan which nevertheless retains a neutral
recommendation. The brokerage says there remains the
likelihood of continued volatility in financial protection
trends, and on top of the AMP isn't paying full-franked
dividends. Its price target rises to A$5.47/share from
A$5.19 after what it says was a good first-half result
from the company. AMP last traded at A$5.77.

2247 GMT [Dow Jones] The overall global recovery
remains on track, but its gradual and it is not an
environment where central banks will be in a hurry to
take away the punch bowl, says AMP chief economist
Shane Oliver. "It's important to note that the Fed is
gradually becoming less dovish," he added. Federal
Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's opening address to
the annual central bankers get together in Jackson Hole
effectively reiterated her assessment that considerable
labor market slack remains but acknowledged
uncertainty in assessing the degree of slack. "Yellen's
somewhat less dovish comments are consistent with the
Fed edging closer to starting to raise interest rates but
remain consistent with the first move on rates not
coming till around mid next year," Mr. Oliver said.

2240 GMT [Dow Jones] IOOF Holdings' (IFL.AU)
near-term prospects are likely to be helped by
acquisition-led EPS growth and a dividend payout ratio
at the top end of the company's guidance range, says
J.P. Morgan. It maintains an overweight
recommendation in anticipation of strong earnings
growth into fiscal 2016 and a healthy fully-franked
dividend yield. IOOF's FY14 underlying profit came in
slightly ahead of J.P. Morgan's forecast. Its price target
rises to A$9.83/share from A$9.44. IFL last traded at
A$8.95. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2236 GMT [Dow Jones] While the Indonesian export
ban on bauxite is likely to add pressure to prices of the
commodity over the medium term, J.P. Morgan notes
the impact on China has yet to be felt materially.
"Further, lower electricity prices in some regions are
helping to offset higher bauxite input costs," the broker
says. Input costs for alumina are typically more
weighted to energy than bauxite. "On this basis we
believe there is a risk the 'cost push' theory to support
higher alumina prices could be less dramatic and take
