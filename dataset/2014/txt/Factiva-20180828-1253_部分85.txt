By Byron Kaye and Stephen Aldred
SYDNEY/HONG KONG, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Two global private equity giants are set to face off in a
battle for Australia's TreasuryWine Estates Ltd after TPG Capital Management LP matched a $3.1
billion move from KKR & Co LP for one of the world's biggest wine makers.

A week after KKR teamed with Rhone Capital LLC to propose a A$5.20 a share offer for Treasury, the
owner of the Penfolds, Lindemans and Wolf Blass brands said on Monday it received a second identical
approach from a global private equity firm which requested anonymity.
The buyout firm behind the second proposal for a firm that expects massive writedowns from problems
in U.S. and China operations was TPG, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Treasury declined to comment further on the second bidder's identity but said it was opening its books
to both suitors for due diligence.

By lodging an offer that matches KKR 's, TPG ensures it gets a first-hand look at the confidential
financial details of the company that attracted its rival in the first place. While the pair could yet
withdraw interest after due diligence, the prospect of competing bids by two of the world's biggest
private equity investors sent Treasury's shares 4 percent higher to close at a year high of A$5.33 -
above the indicative offer from both parties and valuing the target at about $3.21 billion.

"It's highly probable that a deal gets done now that there's two of them," CLSA analyst David Thomas
said. A private equity purchase of Treasury up to A$5.80 a share, or A$3.77 billion, "stacks up",
Thomas said.
"There's been some pretty difficult periods for the business but if you look at where the earnings have
come from there is clear value locked away there, which either the current team or private equity,
through some level of a break-up, could crystallise," said Thomas.

An external spokeswoman for TPG declined to comment. KKR also declined to comment on the news of
a second bidder.

TAKEOVER TARGET

The skirmish for Treasury comes as mergers and acquisitions activity in Australia booms, driven by
takeovers by overseas players. Australian M&A deal volume jumped to $81.1 billion so far this year,
making it the biggest year for deal activity since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.

supplier by volume sales reported profit slumped 38 percent in the six months ended February, with
warnings of more pain to come.
But until last week the company held that its best course was to stick to a turnaround plan under new
chief executive, Mike Clarke . In May, the company said it had turned down a A$4.70 a share, A$2.9
billion approach from KKR .
The company is scheduled to release full-year results on Aug. 21 that are expected to highlight the
impact of oversupply in its U.S. operations and dwindling China sales because of a government
crackdown on luxury gifts, as well as early effects of Clarke's efforts to turn the firm around.
Treasury has also regularly dismissed suggestions it may consider a sale to large trade players like
China's Bright Food Group Co Ltd , France's Pernod Ricard and U.S.-based Constellation Brands Inc .
According to CLSA analyst Thomas, a sale involving a trade buyer could conceivably value Treasury up
to A$7 a share, or A$4.5 billion, because of shared production costs, revenue and other synergies.

However Treasury's willingness to engage with KKR and Rhone based on a A$5.20 a share offer
signalled the level at which the wine maker would consider discussing a takeover.

While KKR -Rhone and TPG have made identical proposals, they are likely to emerge from due
diligence with markedly different proposals from which Treasury's board will then choose the stronger
one, they added.
Treasury is allowing both private equity rivals to do due diligence simultaneously in the hope of
speeding up the process. CEO Clarke is keen to have the matter resolved quickly so it isn't a distraction,
a Treasury spokesman said.

Goldman Sachs , which is advising Treasury, declined to comment. Nomura Holdings is advising the
KKR -Rhone consortium, people familiar with the matter said. Nomura declined to comment.
