MEETINGS: Veteran investor and biotechnology pioneer Leon Serry injected some spice into
Alumina’s annual meeting when he suggested the $3.7 billion company should invite a takeover
bid from Alcoa.
Alumina’s only asset is a 40 per cent share in the Alcoa-managed and 60 per cent-owned global
alumina alliance known as AWAC.

Originally part of WMC Resources (acquired by BHP Billiton), Alumina was split off as a stand-alone
company to encourage competitive bidding after WMC rejected a takeover bid from Alcoa in 2001.
Alcoa has not been back since and would no longer have a free run following last year’s emergence
of China’s Citic with a 15 per cent Alumina stake.
At yesterday’s annual meeting in Melbourne, Alumina chairman John Pizzey said it was not
appropriate to comment on Mr Serry’s suggestion.“Let me tell you that in a general sense, we
discuss many things with Alcoa, and we discuss them at a very senior level. If there is an opportunity,
I am sure they would discuss it with us,’’ he said.
