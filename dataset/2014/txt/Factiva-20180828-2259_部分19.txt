MINUTES OF RBA NOVEMBER BOARD MEETING

The central bank repeated its view that the Australian dollar is overvalued.

It also forecast "a period of stability in interest rates" as its "most prudent course".

Despite significant falls in commodity prices since January - a key driver of the exchange rate over the
long term - the Australian dollar was higher at the end of October against the currencies of Australia's
trading partners, the RBA noted.

"Despite the recent appreciation of the exchange rate, the Australian dollar remained above most
estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the further declines in key commodity prices over
the course of the year to date," the RBA said.

SPEECH BY RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA GOVERNOR GLENN STEVENS TO THE
COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA ANNUAL DINNER
Mr Stevens said interest rates are likely to stay low until non-mining business had the courage to
invest again.

Inflation was likely to remain well under control over the next couple of years, he added.

"In such circumstances, monetary policy should be accommodative and, on present indications, is likely
to be that way for some time yet," Mr Stevens said.

survey's monthly average since 1990.

Deteriorating expectations about household finances for the year ahead was the biggest drag on the
index during the past week, following recent gains.

supply.
