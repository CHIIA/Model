The Ahmedabad-based Adanis are planning to sell half their stake in projects they took over in 2011 to
develop an Australian coal mine and lay a rail line to finance a part of the $8-9 billion investment needed.
The Adanis were in negotiations with China Rail Corporation and another Chinese company but no deal
had been finalised, a high-ranking executive in the Adani group said. The Carmichael mine, in which the
Adanis are planning to shed half their stake, needs an investment of around $5 billion.

Another $2.5 billion must be spent on a 400-km rail line to cart the coal to a port, which in turn will need
yet another $1 billion to build. The investments will be backed by Chinese banks, contracts to Chinese
construction companies, and coal sales to the new investors
