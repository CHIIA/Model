Processing has started in Shepparton of the first type of packaged milk to be exported to China.
The Pactum dairy group’s new milk processing factory is producing the 250 ml UHT ready-to-drink
packages under the Chinese brand.

The production follows the strategic supply agreement between Pactum and China’s Bright Dairy
which occurred in China in April during the visit by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Bright Dairy is launching the new product this month.
Pactum’s parent company Freedom Foods’ managing director Rory McLeod said Bright Dairy was
one of China’s largest dairy producers and sold fresh milk, yoghurt, cheese and milk powder.

They are distributed through more than 400 000 sales outlets. Sales in the the 2013 financial year
totalled $2.6 billion.

Mr MacLeod said Australia had a unique advantage in the supply and manufacture of high quality
agriculture-based foods.
‘‘With increasing demand from markets in China and South-East Asia for high quality value-added
product, Australia, through companies such as Pactum, is well placed to play an important role in this
supply chain,’’ Mr McLeod said.
