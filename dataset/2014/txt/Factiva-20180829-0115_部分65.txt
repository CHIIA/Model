Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" says, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract up 27 points.

"Yesterday index leadership was quite bearish with micro and small caps down 1% while the top 20 did all
the heavy lifting again, managing to finish just in front for the session.

"But the top 20 can only do so much. Unless the rest of the market joins in shortly, this last pillar will
eventually be removed too.

"The ceiling will be 5433. The floor will be 5384. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5406, up 16.8 points'.

NEWS OF THE DAY
BP to cease production at Bulwer Island refinery in Brisbane mid 2015
Reuters reports BP said on Wednesday it will cease production at its Bulwer Island refinery in Brisbane by
mid 2015, blaming competition from large, more cost-effective, refineries in Asia that has piled pressure
on smaller plants in Australia.

Australia's refineries, owned by BP, Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil and Caltex, have mostly booked
losses over several years as a higher Australian dollar, tighter fuel quality standards and mega-refineries
in Asia have made them uncompetitive.

Rather than spend money on upgrading plants, the majors have been looking to sell them or turn them
into fuel import terminals.
BP said it was considering converting the Bulwer Island refinery, which dates back to the 1960s and has a
capacity to produce 102,000 barrels of fuel per day, into a multi-product import terminal.

Philip Morris to cease cigarette production at Moorabbin, Vic by year end

Reuters reports Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) said it will cease cigarette production in Australia
this year as a result of plain-packaging laws and the growth of illicit trade in the country.

About 180 jobs will be cut from its Australian center in Moorabbin, Victoria by the year's end, with
production transferred to Korea, the company said in a statement.

Changes in substantials reported March 31 and April 1 inc posted separately.

LARGE CAP INDUSTRIALS
*CSR: Acquires AFS Products Group for $40 mln plus
CSR Ltd announced it has reached agreement to acquire the businesses of AFS Products Group Ltd, a
leader in load bearing permanent formwork walling solutions for the construction industry.
The acquisition provides a strong platform for CSR to enter the structural walling systems market. CSR
will pay an initial consideration of $40 million following completion of the transaction, to be funded via
existing cash and debt facilities and is expected to be earnings accretive in the first year. Additional
payments over the next three years depend on achieving growth targets.

AFS is the leading provider of fibre cement based permanent formwork systems through the Logicwall
products, manufactured at its facility in Goulburn, NSW. Over 30,000 multi residential units have been
completed to date. CSR has a long standing relationship with AFS as the supplier of its Cemintel fibre
cement products into the Ligicwall system. AFS also supplies Rediwall, a polymer based permanent
formwork system for concrete walls which is water resistant and is used predominantly in basement and
retaining walls in multi residential buildings.

*GFF: Full year EBIT to be down 10/15% on consensus expectations

Goodman Fielder Ltd announced in an update on market conditions across its businesses and its financial
performance for the year ended June 30 said while at the half year result announced on February 12 the

Page184of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.company had expected normalised earnings before interest and tax for full year 2014 to be broadly in line
with the prior year, subject to market conditions remaining substantially as they were at that time.

Since then trading conditions in Australia and New Zealand have deteriorated and manufacturing and
supply chain cost savings under Project Renaissance have been delayed.
This has required the company to revise earnings expectations for the fourth quarter.

Baking volumes increased in the third quarter but net average selling price was lower than expected.

Third quarter earnings in the grocery division were lower than expected due to increased competition.
In the New Zealand dairy business a further increase in the farmgate milk price from $NZ8.30 to
$NZ8.65kg/S is expected to impact earnings in the short term.
Earnings expectations in the Asia Pacific business remains largely unchanged.

Full year 2014 revised outlook

Given the deterioration in market conditions since February and a revision to 4th quarter forecasts GFF
now expects normalised EBIT for 2014 to be approximately 10/15% below the current analysts' consensus
ofapproximately $180 million.
The company is also expected to record non cash impairments, given the deterioration in the trading
outlook across its portfolio.
As a result of lower forecast earnings, the company's net debt position at June 30 is not expected to
reduce as previously anticipated. However GFF's financial position remains strong and the company
continues to operate comfortably within its debt covenants.
The company has also accelerated its cost saving initiatives, primarily through headcount reduction in the
4th quarter of 2014 and expects to achieve an additional $25 million in cost savings by full year 2015.
Cash restructuring costs related to redundancies are expected to be recorded as significant items in the
2014 accounts.
