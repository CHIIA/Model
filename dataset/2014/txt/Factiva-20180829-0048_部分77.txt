Forty-five large foreign-owned companies now own nearly 12 per cent, or 47.2 million hectares, of
Australia’s 400 million hectares of farmland, according to figures released by the Australian Bureau
of Statistics.
These big foreign investors, which include pension funds, private equity players, foreign
governments such as Qatar’s Hassad Foods and global listed agricultural companies such as AACo,
all own more than a minimum of 100,000ha of land each.

Overall, 806 companies or part-foreign businesses now control nearly 50 million ha of Australia’s
400 million hectare pastoral and farming country, equivalent to 12.5 per cent of the nation’s farm
area.
The ABS reported that since its last survey in 2010, an additional 5 million hectare had slipped into
foreign hands, an increase of 11 per cent.

The figures provide the most recent snapshot of the sensitive political issue of foreign owned farms,
since the Abbott government earlier this year altered the price threshold above which Foreign
Investment Review Board approval for farm purchases must be sought from $248 million to $15m.

The government has also promised to bring in a foreign land register recording all farmland sales to
foreign entities, but has stalled on its introduction because of fears it could hinder sensitive trade
talks with China.

The most recent figures up until yesterday were from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics in 2012 which recorded 11 per cent of farmland and 9 per cent of water
entitlements as having some level of foreign ownership.

The latest ABS figures showed most foreign owned rural businesses either operated cattle feedlots
— such as the Sumitomo feedlot at Rangers Valley near Glen Innes — vineyards, almond orchards
or large horticultural, cotton or cropping ventures.
Despite the boom in Asian demand for dairy and milk products, the dairy industry remained the
least foreign owned in 2013.

Irrigation water appears to be a growing attraction for foreign investors. While total agricultural water
entitlements issued in Australia decreased in 2013 to 13.2 million megalitres with Murray-Darling
Basin buybacks, the level of foreign ownership grew from 1.2 million megalitres in 2010 to 1.8
million megalitres last year.

This represented an increase of 55 per cent in three years, with 14 per cent of water licences now in
foreign hands compared with 9 per cent in 2010.

The Northern Territory has the highest proportion of foreign controlled country with 32 per cent of its
land, or 17.7 million hectares, in overseas hands.

overseas farmland ownership with just 2 per cent or 238,000 ha foreign owned.The area of
agricultural land in Australia owned by businesses with a level of foreign ownership increased from
44.9 million hectares to 49.6 million in 2½ years.
