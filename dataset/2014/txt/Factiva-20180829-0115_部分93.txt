Current Environment

Sector Overview

Controlling the cost of healthcare and pharmaceutical prices remained a priority for governments through
the Asia-Pacific over the last six months. The Asia-Pacific healthcare industry continued to face growing
budgetary pressure, with a total of US$1.34 trillion spent for healthcare in 2013, up from US$1.2 trillion in
2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported. The healthcare spending is expected to grow at a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% annually to reach US$2.7 trillion by 2020. The rising
healthcare costs in the Asia-Pacific were mostly spurred by the region's ageing population, technology
advances, and increasing consumer awareness of health-related issues.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD ) report, in the
Asia-Pacific 62% of the total healthcare spending in 2012 came from public sources, while the remaining
38% were from private payers. The public share of healthcare spending in 2012 has significantly
increased in the Asian countries from 46.6% in 2010. The combination of public and private spending to
broaden basic health coverage has led to a steady rise in per capita healthcare spending in the region.
Based on OECD data, during the ten-year period of 2000-2010, the average per capita healthcare
spending in China has grown at a higher rate than those in other Asian countries, with a growth rate of
about 11% per year per capita, compared to 6% and 2% in India and Australia respectively.

Given that pharmaceuticals accounted for 17% of overall healthcare spending globally, pharmaceutical
companies also sought solutions to rising costs. In Australia, pricing and reimbursement remained high on
companies' agendas as they collaborated with the Department of Health (DoH) to provide the industry with
some certainty over future pricing policy. In South Korea, the economic crisis of 2007-2009 forced the
Government to review its healthcare policy, while In January 2012, Taiwan adopted new health technology

Page265of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.assessment (HTA) measures to optimize healthcare resources while improving access to new
pharmaceutical and healthcare products.
Japan and China also proclaimed their intention to develop and implement pharmaco-economic
assessments. These moves provided opportunities for the industry to engage with payers and
governments to help in the formation of HTA measures and become a valued stakeholder in the
healthcare environment. The Indian Government introduced a new policy to control the prices of 358 drugs
categorized in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), including imported medicines. The
proposed policy is estimated to cut the price of drugs by 3% to 10%.

Asian pharmaceutical stocks meanwhile put in a reasonably solid performance in share price movements
over the six-month period from September 30, 2013 to February 10, 2014. The shares of Asia's leading
pharmaceutical companies tracked by Mergent recorded almost 12% average growth, with stock price of
Ranbaxy (BSE: 500359) rising the highest at 27.39%. Ten out of the 11 stocks closed higher, while one
ended the period lower.

Sector Performance

Since the 2008 global economic crisis, the share prices of leading Asian pharmaceutical companies have
been on a downtrend. However, in recent months there was a steady recovery and turnaround. According
to a Mergent analysis, the share price movements of 11 major companies in the region posted average
gains of 12% over the six months period from September 30, 2013 to February 10, 2014. Ten out of the 11
companies saw their share prices close positive over the period, with double-digit percentage up to more
than 27%.
In 2012, the global pharmaceutical sector generated total revenue of US$959.0 billion, up by 2.4% from
the previous year. The Americas had the largest share of the market at US$417.6 billion, followed by the
sub-region of Asia, Africa and Australia at US$168.1 billion, and Japan at US$110.5 billion. The
Asia-Pacific's pharmaceutical sector overshadowed the biotechnology and medical sub-sectors in the first
half of 2013, with a 56.5% share by value and 44.6% share by volume, according to a Mergermarket
report.
Pharmaceutical sales in India totaled US$22.6 billion in 2012, accounting for 22.6% of healthcare
expenditure, and are expected to rise to US$27 billion in 2016. India's largest pharmaceutical
companyRanbaxy Laboratories saw its stock price move the highest from Rs335.00 (US$5.56) on
September 30, 2013 and closed at Rs461.40 (US$7.66) on February 10, 2014, an increase by 27.39%.
The company reported consolidated sales of Rs27.5 billion (US$443.63 million) for the third quarter of
2013, up by 3.0% from the corresponding quarter in 2012. In the first nine-months of 2013, consolidated

Page266of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.sales declined to Rs77.5 billion (US$1.25 billion), from Rs95.8 billion (US$1.55 billion) a year earlier,
due to pricing policy, trade concerns and the absence of large post-exclusivity sales of Atorvastatin, an
oral drug that lowers level of cholesterol in blood.

The Japanese pharmaceutical market is the world's second largest, after the US, with sales of US$134.4
billion in 2013, or approximately 12% of the global market. Takeda Pharmaceutical (TSE: 4502) is the
nation's largest pharmaceutical company and among the top 15 pharmaceutical companies in Asia. For
the six-months ended September 30, 2013, its consolidated net sales totaled Y828.3 billion (US$8.13
billion), up by 5.3% from the same period of the previous year. The company forecasts consolidated net
sales of Y1,680 billion (US$16.48 billion) for the six months to March 31, 2014. Takeda's stock price rose
9.02% to Y5,100 (US$49.93) on February 10, 2014, from Y4,640 (US$45.43) on September 30, 2013.

The share price of Eisai Co Ltd (TSE: 4523), however, declined 0.5% during the reviewed period, from
Y4,050 (US$39.65) to Y4,030 (US$39.45). The company generated Y448,047 million (US$4.39 billion)
in net sales during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2013, up 3.8% from the corresponding
quarter in the previous year. Its net income, however, declined 13.3% to Y29,492 million (US$0.29 billion)
and basic earning per share (EPS) fell from Y119.34 (US$1.17) to Y103.43 (US$1.01).

Leading Companies

Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (TSE: 4502)

Over the six months to September 30, 2013, Takeda Pharmaceutical 's consolidated net sales totaled
Y828.3 billion (US$8.18 billion), up by 5.3% from a year earlier. Sales in the domestic market increased
mainly due to newly launched products Azilva, a drug that lowers blood pressure and Nesina, for the
treatment of type-2 diabetes in adults. However, consolidated operating income fell by 7.9% from a year
earlier to Y100 billion (US$987.2 million), mostly due to an 18.2% drop in sales revenue from Actos, the
type-2 diabetes treatment drug that reduces blood glucose levels, an increase in amortization expenses
for intangible assets and an increase in research and development (R&D) expenses. Consolidated
ordinary income dropped 14.5% to Y96.7 billion (US$954.6 million), while consolidated net income fell
46% to Y64.7 billion (US$638.7 million).
Domestic net sales for the ethical drugs segment totaled Y290.9 billion (US$2.87 billion), down by 1.8%
from the previous year, as higher sales of products such as Nesina and Azilva could not fully offset the
drop in sales of Actos and Blopress (to treat hypertension). Oversea sales increased by 10.5% from the
previous year to Y457.8 billion (US$4.52 billion), mostly contributed by sales of Colcrys, a convenient
drug for the treatment of gout. The increase in oversea sales coupled with the depreciation of the yen has
managed to offset the decline in sales of Actos and Blopress, which were affected by the introduction of
generic products in the US and Europe.

For five years from fiscal 2013, Takeda aims for a CAGR of at least 20% for operating income, and in the
mid-single-digit range for sales, and maintain a dividend per share of Y180 (US$1.78) a year from fiscal
2013 to 2015. Takeda has made steady progress in improving R&D productivity, as in early 2014, the
company announced that Vedolizumab, an investigational drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease, had begun phase three of clinical trials. In March 2013, Takeda submitted a marketing
authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and a biologics licensee
application (BLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2013 for Vedolizumab.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories (BSE: 500124)
In the third quarter of 2013, this Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company posted consolidated net
profit after tax of Rs6.9 billion (US$111.7 million), a 91.2% jump from the previous quarter, but a 7.2%
decline from a year earlier. Consolidated net sales totaled Rs33.6 billion (US$543.8 million), down by
38.1% from the equivalent quarter in 2012. Its revenue from pharmaceutical services and active
ingredients totaled Rs7.8 billion (US$126.2 million) and from global generics Rs26.5 billion (US$428.9
million). Its revenue from proprietary products totaled Rs425.4 million (US$6.88 million) and from other
segments Rs198.7 million (US$3.22 million). There was an increase by 16.1% to Rs35 billion (US$0.57
million) in consolidated revenue for all segments as compared to the corresponding quarter the previous
year.

Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TSE: 4508)

Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma posted relatively modest sales growth of 0.2% during the nine-months period
ended December 31, 2013, from Y322.6 billion (US$3.18 billion) a year earlier to Y32.2 billion
(US$317.9 million), mostly due to sales of other new drugs and Remicade, used for reducing the signs
and symptoms of inflammation in moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Its net income was up 24.4%,
year-on-year to Y43.8 billion (US$432.4 million), but its operating income declined 5.7% and ordinary
income fell by 3.9%.

Page267of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Merger, Acquisition and Alliance Activity

In the past six months, the Asia-Pacific saw strong deal volume, specifically in mergers and acquisitions
(M&A), licensing agreements and partnerships. The number of Asia-Pacific deals represented 32.6% of
global transactions in first half 2013, with M&A accounting for 56.38% of Asia-Pacific deals, according to
industry research company GlobalData's PharmaSphere. However, from 2008 to 2012 there was a
declining trend in the number of M&As, mostly due to the global economic recession and low capital
investment. Licensing agreements accounted for 31% of deal value, while the rest comprised strategic
collaboration and partnership activity.
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) M&A deal transactions in the fourth quarter of 2013 dropped
11.6% from 129 deals in deal volume during the relative quarter in 2012 while deal values were up 45.8%
overall to US$143.2 billion. In February 2013, Pfizer sold 20% of its animal health business to Zoetis
(NYSE: ZTS), which mainly engages in offering medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products, genetic tests,
and a range of services related to animal health. Worth at US$958 million, Allergan (NYSE: AGN)
acquired MAP Pharmaceuticals (NMS: MAPP), which develops and commercializes new therapies in
neurology, including Levadex, an orally inhaled drug for the potential treatment of acute migraine in adults.

In May 2013, Takeda Pharmaceutical targeted to acquire the Colorado-based private biopharmaceutical
company specialized in R&D of innovative vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, including dengue
and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), Inviragen Inc for a down payment of US$35 million, and
future payments of up to US$215 million allied to the progress of clinical development and achievement
of key commercial milestones.

Industry Profile

Industry Size and Value
With a population of more than four billion people, the Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical market is worth more
than US$140 billion. Japan and China are the two largest drug markets, accounting for about 70% of the
total value. The Asia-Pacific is the world's third largest pharmaceutical market, after North America and
Europe, and growing robustly as the fastest developing market in the world with 56.5% share by value and

provider of generic medicines, accounting for 20% of the global generic drugs exports. According to the
Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) in 2013, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was up
86.5% from the previous year to a total of US$1.08 billion.

Japan's pharmaceutical industry is the second largest in the world and has become one of the world's best
markets for foreign drug companies. With its emerging growth rates, Japan pharmaceutical market ranks
in the top eight multinational drug firms across the world. About one third of Japan's population is insured
by civic and national government bodies, and two thirds by private insurance societies. All operate under
the same reimbursement rules for drugs and medical procedures.

The South Korean pharmaceutical market is small but it is rapidly developing in the area of stem cell
therapy and possesses a robust pipeline with pharmaceutical companies closely involved. Pharmaceutical
expenditure projections totaled KRW16,106.7 billion (US$14.45 billion) in 2013. The market size reached
US$16 billion in 2012, with a CAGR of 7% over the past ten years. South Korea was experiencing rising
exports of its pharmaceutical products over the past five years with the average export rose by 20%
annually. Major exporting countries are mostly Asian countries such as Japan, Vietnam and China. In

projected to the pharmaceutical expenditure throughout the year, and the market is expected to reach
US$5.5 billion by 2018.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

As the Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing pharmaceutical market in the world, pharmaceutical regulations
in this region are fast gaining attention among pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Since the past six
months, new and improved regulations are implemented frequently in Asia. Among them include the
changes in good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, drug price controls and medical device
regulatory systems. In India, along with its Government's objective to improve the basic healthcare and
access of basic medicines at an affordable price across the country, the Department of Pharmaceuticals,
Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers issued the Drug (Prices Control) Order 2013 in May 2013, which
authorizes the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to regulate the prices of 348 essential
medicines.
Throughout 2012, government authorities in China including State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA),
Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), engaged in the
efforts of strengthening drug regulation by placing high emphasis on price control, drug safety, GMP
implementation, drug registration system reform and OTC drug management. In November 2013, the
China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) issued an amendment to the Drug Registration Regulation
(DRR) which imposed new requirements for companies with new drug registrations to seek for CFDA's
approval through a supplementary application with supporting documents and study data for any changes
of applicant during clinical studies for new drugs or changes in manufacturing process, formulation,
specification or manufacturing site for chemical drugs and biological products, which aims to ensure drug
safety in the nation's pharmaceutical industry.

The Asian financial crisis has threatened the sustainability of the South Korean healthcare insurance and
public healthcare expenditure has significantly increased over time. Cost-containment policies have been
implemented and directly affected the prices of pharmaceuticals in the country. The Government has
proposed price cuts through 2025, demonstrating its effort to secure further savings. The price cuts did not
necessarily target just generics, but certain innovative drugs were also affected. For example, the price of
the drug Lyrica, a prescription drug used to treat nerve and muscle pain, dropped by more than 20% in

Page269of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.2013. In December 2013, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) announced to implement its
market-based actual transaction price (M-ATP) system, effective from February 2014.

billion. Generic drugs are also becoming more popular in the Asia-Pacific, which make up over 60% of the
pharmaceutical sales of China and India.

Looking forward, there are many key growth opportunities in the short-medium term as the demand for
Asia-Pacific pharmaceuticals and healthcare continues to grow.

Market Trends & Outlook

Growing Demand for Pharmaceuticals in Asia

Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical sector has been expanding rapidly in recent years, in line with the region's
strong economic growth and demographic changes. Rising household incomes, increased government
expenditure on healthcare, higher life expectancies, consumer health awareness and lifestyles changes
have boosted the market demand for pharmaceuticals. Many Asian countries have been experiencing
rapid population growth.
The Indian population, for example, grew from 1.02 billion in 2001 to 1.27 billion in February 2014. This
rapid population growth has been the result of not only high birth rates, but also increases in life
expectancy, which contributed to higher pharmaceuticals demand. Countries with low birth rates, such as
China, Japan and Singapore, are now facing ageing populations, and presents growth opportunities for
pharmaceutical companies to produce more specialized drugs for various types of diseases, especially
among the elderly population.

A home to 60% of the world's population, the Asia-Pacific spans vast geography, which offers tremendous
market potential. The large population makes the Asia-Pacific the fastest-growing pharmaceutical market
globally. High population densities especially in metropolitan areas, coupled with large hospital
infrastructure allow clinical trial operations to be facilitated in Asia. Asia has risen to become one of the
top clinical trial destinations across the world. The region's clinical trials market has been steadily growing
with greater focus primarily on India, China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.

Rising household incomes also drives demand for better drugs and medications. Higher average incomes
and growing middle class are expected to make health insurance more affordable, leading to more citizens
seeking treatment, even for more expensive medication and boost prescription compliances. Increase in
incomes will then drive to lifestyle changes. As Asians has become richer, their lifestyles have evolved.

Page270of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.A healthy diet might no longer an issue especially for wealthier populations. For example, they now
consume more innutritious foods and beverages and do less exercise. This has been evidenced by an
increase in diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart ailments. China and India have the world's
largest diabetic populations, with over 90 million and 60 million people respectively, according to the
International Diabetes Federation .

The change in people's lifestyle has caused a shift from acute to chronic types of illness, which requires
continuous treatment. Hence, the shortage of medical institutions in Asia-Pacific to provide the changing
environment has become a serious concern. At the same time, the number of patients who travel to Asia
to receive treatment has grown, due to the development of medical technology and cost advantages in
medical care in the region.

Meanwhile, governments in the region have invested in healthcare infrastructure and services in order to
lighten the burden of households and to cope with changing disease profiles. For example, China has
implemented healthcare reform, which aims to provide universal coverage and improve patient access to
healthcare services. In addition, the combination of public and private spending has led to a steady rise in
per capita healthcare spending in the region, which subsequently has benefited the pharmaceutical sector.
Today, the pharmaceutical market has grown rapidly in the Asia-Pacific, with total sales close to US$300
billion.

The Rising Tide of OTC in Asia
In recent years, global sales of OTC drugs have surged, worth over US$100 billion. OTC drugs typically
bring fewer side effects than prescription medicines, tend to be more affordable and able to relieve acute
symptoms, such as pain and cough, which have become key drivers in pharmaceutical market growth. In
urban areas, greater disposable income has benefited sales of OTC drugs, with sales mostly driven by the
wealthy middle classes, meanwhile, expanded distribution by numerous marketers has helped sales
growth in rural locations.

OTC sales in emerging markets for the 12 months period ended March 31, 2013 showed that most
Asia-Pacific countries (excluding Japan) are growing faster than the global average. The positive sales
performance in emerging markets has led to a larger share of the global OTC market, which now
accounted for 50% of the total global OTC marketplace, according to IMS Health .

Looking at the global performance of OTC categories in the 12 months period ended March 31, 2013,
cough, cold and respiratory; vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) and tonics; pain relief; digestive;
and skin accounted for three-quarters of total OTC sales worldwide. The ?Others? category, which
accounted for 46.4% of total sales, was much bigger and largely driven by traditional Chinese medicines
and Indian Ayurvedic treatments.
China is the No.1 OTC market in the Asia-Pacific with a record of nearly 10% growth, despite competition
from low-priced of essential drugs and growing popularity of store brands. China dominates in terms of

Generics to Generate Greater Percentage of Asian Pharmaceutical Sales

much less than that of branded drugs. Generally, generic drugs make up over 60% of total pharmaceutical
sales of China and India. The Asia-Pacific is emerging as a new destination for the generic drugs industry.
It was a result from the issue of poorly defined regulatory pathways faced by the western countries, while a
few Asian countries are well positioned to benefit from these changes, hence attracting huge investments
by generic companies.
In China, generics represented close to 70% of market value, while about 90% of Indian prescription
drugs sales was represented by its generics. In fact, generic drugs are likely to remain as the stronghold
for China's pharmaceutical market. China continues to rely upon widespread prescription of generics in
public insurance plan to control healthcare expenditures, since the current R&D capability limits the
possibility of launching domestic patented drugs. The key driver for the uptake of generics drugs is the
preference for cheap generics over more expensive branded drugs among poorer patients and majority of
pharmaceutical products available in China and those covered by the Essential Drug List (EDL) and
National Drug Reimbursement List (NDRL) are domestically manufactured generics.

In India, according to the research enclosed in the Asia-Pacific R&D Pharmaceutical Factbook, Indian
generic drug companies are making significant investments in innovative R&D and have generated the
largest new drug pipelines among generics companies worldwide. Multi-national pharmaceutical
companies are likely to face increased competition from this scenario. Overall, India's exports of generics
have been growing at a rate of 24% per year over the last four years, with a total of US$14.7 billion in

Page271of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.2012-13. 55% of Indian generics exports were sold in highly regulated western markets, according to the
Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil ) and the Indian Brand Equity Foundation
(IBEF).

Indian generic firms like Glenmark (BSE: GPL), Sun Pharmaceuticals (BSE: 524715) and Ranbaxy (BSE:
500359) having year-to-year revenue growth ranging from nearly 33% to 72% in 2012, according to
GlobalData report. In 2012, India was recognized as the world's largest supplier of generics, and the
country is still improving access to life-saving medicines in many developing countries.

Market Outlook

Competition in the Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical sector is expected to intensify this year as major
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise their investment in the region across sales and marketing,
R&D and pharmaceutical products manufacturing. As drugmakers face an increasingly competitive
landscape and development costs continue to rise, big and small pharmaceutical firms are seeking every
advantage to maximize their R&D returns. Many companies have come to the Asia-Pacific for better
access to patients, lower costs and operational efficiencies.

Looking forward, there are many key growth opportunities in the short-medium term as the demand for
Asia-Pacific pharmaceuticals and healthcare continues to grow, leading to an increase in investments by
companies who eager to capture the growth.

Continued economic growth in Asia has led to rising household income and spending for pharmaceuticals
and healthcare. Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical industries are benefiting from the growing population, which
has better access to healthcare and are able to pay for medicines. Government actions in the region to
broaden access for pharmaceuticals, together with longer life expectancies and lifestyle changes will also
boost demand for pharmaceutical market.
The strong inward and outward flow of M&A among the large and medium-sized drugmakers are expected
to continue, driven by the need to fill in gaps in product pipelines and expand business footholds.

Continuous technological advancements and product innovation, government funding and insurance
coverage, as well as ageing population will continue to be the essential key drivers towards the
development of the Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical industry. In future, the pharmaceutical market will be
affected by various regulatory and numerous drug payer actions, including the imposition of price control,
drug safety, good manufacturing practice (GMP) implementation, drug registration system reform and OTC
drug management. As outsourcing, manufacturing and R&D continue to grow throughout the region, it is
high likely that regulatory changes will continue to evolve at a fast pace in the Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical
industry.

95.54 million) for litigation in the US.

Market Outlook

The sector's strong growth and continued interest from foreign investors are positive indicators of its
robustness, while the inherent strengths and the outstanding growth of Indian generics are the driving
forces behind rising foreign investment. It is likely to attract more investment as India provides a hospitable
environment for FDI, with its low labor and production costs. A growing and more affluent population is
expected to underpin demand for pharmaceuticals, and Indian companies will continue to benefit from an
expanding domestic market and strong growth potential in generics in developed markets.

The industry is likely to enjoy double-digit growth in 2014 and beyond because of the rise in
pharmaceutical outsourcing and intensifying investment by multinational companies. A large percentage of
India's pharmaceutical products are exported as leading players expand their reach into western markets.
Due to continuous investment in R&D, India's clinical trials market is likely to grow at a blistering pace in
coming years.

Japan

Sector Overview

Japan's pharmaceutical industry is the world's second largest after that of the US, with annual sales of
more than Y6 trillion (US$58.4 billion). However, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami affected the sector
that was already struggling with a stagnating economy, regular price cuts and increasing competition from
China and India.

Japan's pharmaceutical industry is becoming more global, not only by entering new markets, particularly
developing markets, but also by adopting more innovative strategies and making investments in
subsidiaries set up in other Asian countries. US approval in late 2010 of Halaven to treat progressive
breast cancer, followed by approval in Europe and Japan in early 2011, indicated the growing presence of

Page275of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Japanese pharmaceuticals in global markets. Japan's pharmaceutical market value totaled US$89.1
billion in 2012, and is expected to be worth US$104.5 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 2%.

Industry Size and Value
Japan's pharmaceutical market is the world's second largest after China's and ahead of that in the US.
However, drug price reductions implemented by the Government in an effort to cut healthcare expenditure,
the slow growth in market share and competition from generics has depressed market value. Although this
presents opportunities for generic manufacturers, generics' greater share has trimmed market value. The
easing of regulatory guidelines, an ageing population and a strong product pipeline will provide strong
momentum for industry growth.
According to Credit Suisse Securities, national health expenditure in 2013 was close to US$10 billion (Y1
trillion) and the Government plans to invest another US$501 billion (Y50 trillion) within the next ten years
to support healthcare costs. Effective April 2014, Japan will levy the first phase of an additional 3%
consumption tax on all medicines.

Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd (TYO: 4568)
million), because of a gain on investment securities and an increase in tax deductions for experimental
and research expenses.

Market Outlook

Although an ageing population presents many challenges to Japan's pharmaceutical market, continuous
initiatives to encourage R&D will lead to the approval of innovative drugs and to growth for companies that
market them. By 2020 Japan's pharmaceutical companies could establish solid positions in global new
drug markets and become a key driver of the economy. The Japanese market for pharmaceuticals is
forecast to increase by 1% to 4% over the next few years, although biennial price cuts will lower growth in
2014 and 2016. The implementation of strategic reforms will continue to encourage greater adoption of
new medicines and shift use from off-patent brands to generics. While Japan's population as a whole will
decline, its ageing is expected to drive up demand for medicines.

South Korea

Sector Overview

The South Korean pharmaceutical industry is a pioneer in stem cell therapy and among global leaders in
stem cell research. It has a robust pipeline because of active participation by its pharmaceutical
companies. South Korea continues to invest in pharmaceutical R&D and, in July 2013, the Health Ministry
announced that it would spend KRW10 trillion (US$8.9 billion) over the next five years on projects to
develop 20 new drugs in partnership with private domestic companies.

Industry Size and Value

Its pharmaceutical market is the world's 10th largest and the fourth largest healthcare market in the
Asia-Pacific, behind Japan, China, and Australia, according to the WHO. The market is highly fragmented,
with almost all domestic companies having a strong portfolio of generic products rather than expensive,
branded drugs. Japan and China are the largest buyers of South Korean pharmaceuticals. Market value
rose to KRW16,088 billion (US$13.99 billion) in 2013, from KRW15,717 billion (US$13.96 billion) in

Market Outlook

of the pharmaceutical industry. The roadmap aims to stimulate innovative drug development and overseas
expansion of South Korean pharmaceutical companies and to make the industry the seventh largest
globally by 2020.

Taiwan

Sector Overview

Taiwan has a very strong active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) industry that provides specialty chemicals
and high quality APIs globally and concentrates strongly on generic drugs as there are frequent drug price
reductions through the National Health Insurance Scheme. Its healthcare market is driven by a
single-payer global budget system under the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI). In 2013
healthcare expenditure totaled NT$161.33 billion (US$5.51 billion), and is projected to grow to
NT$168.94 billion (US$5.93 billion) in 2014, according to Business Market International.

Cancer is the leading cause of death in Taiwan, followed by cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,
and diabetes. Nearly 70% of 153,823 Taiwan deaths in 2012 were related to nine major diseases,
including malignancy, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes, Taiwan Ministry of Health
and Welfare (MOHW) figures show.

Industry Size and Value
The pharmaceutical market was valued at US$4.4 billion in fiscal 2012-13, which US$1.6 billion
revenues came from OTC market, while the traditional medicines segment was the most profitable market
accounting for 51.5% of overall pharmaceutical revenues. The pharmaceutical market had a CAGR of
2.9% from 2006 to 2013, and is expected to have a CAGR of 3.9% to US$5.5 billion by 2018.

According to Taiwan's MOHW, about 80% of Taiwan's pharmaceutical products are sold through hospitals,
15% through local pharmacies and 5% in clinics. A large percentage of Taiwan's drugs come from
domestic manufacturing facilities owned by international pharmaceutical companies, with less than half
imported, mainly from the US and Europe.

Leading Companies

Although operating income showed a loss of US$1.6 million, net income after tax totaled US$2.5 million,
compared with a loss of US$7.9 million the previous quarter.

Market Outlook

According to IMS the Taiwanese pharmaceutical market contracted for the first time in 20 years in 2012,
with negative growth of 0.9%, while the hospital segment experienced a 2.3% decline. This followed the
seventh biennial round of price cuts under the Price-Volume Survey (PVS) mechanism and reimbursement
system.

The market is extremely difficult, with prices constantly decreasing, more companies competing for market
share and product life cycles becoming shorter. Consequently, the Department of Health (DoH) and the
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) introduced second-generation National Health Insurance
(NHI), which is expected to improve pricing and regulatory policies.
Trade relations with China have improved with the recent signing of the Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement, and the Cross-Strait Cooperation Agreement on Medicine and Public Health
Affairs, both aimed at promoting cooperation in medicine development and disease prevention. The
agreements could be the channels for new drugs to gain access to the much larger Chinese market.

An ageing population, the rising prevalence of lifestyle diseases and the increasing demand for new
medical technologies are expected to drive market growth. The demand for new oncology and liver cancer
drugs is likely to increase, and circulatory and genitourinary diseases are other key therapeutic areas that
are potential growth contributors.
