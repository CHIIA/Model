SYDNEY--Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd. (F34.SG) and Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. (0142.HK)
laid all their cards on the table in their pursuit of Goodman Fielder Ltd. (GFF.AU), sweetening their
takeover bid for the Australian food producer while declaring their offer final.

Wilmar and First Pacific are now offering 70 Australian cents for each Goodman Fielder share, valuing
the company at about 1.37 billion Australian dollars ($1.28 billion). The bid won't rise again, unless a
competing bidder emerges, the pair said in separate statements.

A Goodman Fielder spokesman wasn't immediately available for comment, but the company is
expected to respond to the fresh advance in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange later on
Friday.

Goodman Fielder manufactures some of Australia's most recognizable food brands, including Meadow
Lea margarine, Praise mayonnaise and Wonder White bread. Wilmar has been touted as a potential
buyer ever since it took a 10% stake in Goodman Fielder two years ago.

The sweetened offer won't surprise many in the market: Goodman Fielder's shares last traded at around
67.25 Australian cents, above the original 65 Australian cents offer price, as some investors bet a higher
bid would materialize.

CIMB said in recent note that the original 65 Australian cents bid, at about 7.2 times Goodman's
Fielder's enterprise value-to-operating earnings, is lower than the average historical multiple of about
eight times for similar deals in the Australian food sector.

The broker added that the bid looked opportunistic because Goodman Fielder has suffered recent
operational difficulties such as high commodities prices.
