ZBB Energy Corporation Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Net Loss Improvement of $924,488
Backlog Increases to $8.8 Million

TD

MILWAUKEE, WI--(Marketwired - Feb 13, 2014) - ZBB Energy Corporation (NYSE MKT: ZBB), a leading
developer of intelligent, renewable energy power platforms and hybrid vehicle control systems, today
announced its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013.

Second Quarter Highlights
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Company's major accomplishments included:

-- Signed a joint development agreement with

Lotte Chemical to design and

develop a 500 kWh battery and granted a non-exclusive license for Lotte
to sell ZBB's zinc-bromide continuous flow battery outside of the United
States and China.

-- Completed the installation of a 300 kWh ZBB EnerStore(R) advanced flow

battery at a location in southern California to demonstrate the combined
value of solar power and energy storage.

-- The NYSE MKT accepted the Company's compliance plan and granted the

Company an extension until April 15, 2015 to regain compliance with the
minimum stockholders' equity continued listing standards.

-- Crosspoint Kinetics (http://crosspointkinetics.com), a subsidiary of
Cummins Crosspoint, announced the commercial launch of its S3000 hybrid
system for buses and trucks. ZBB Energy designs and manufactures the
S3000 controller, the heart of the S3000 hybrid system.

-- Received a follow-on order for several Multiple Input Power Supplies

(MIPS), a product augmentation to ZBB's EnerSection(R).

"The signing of our new collaboration agreement with Lotte Chemical represents a significant achievement
in the quarter. In addition to expanding our non-exclusive license to Lotte to sell our zinc-bromide flow
battery outside of the United States and China, we are designing a new 500 kWh battery for Lotte, which
will significantly increase energy density and system efficiency while achieving substantial cost reduction,
" said Eric C. Apfelbach, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Partnership with Lotte has enabled
us to stay on the leading edge of flow battery product capability and expand our global reach while
minimizing the financial burden. We will continue our effort to add synergistic partners this year that would
help accelerate growth."

Page333of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved."We believe our global supply chain, manufacturing and market channels will give ZBB a compelling
advantage as the grid storage markets ramp," continued Mr. Apfelbach. "Our strong position should also
make us competitive in the upcoming multi-billion dollar bids related to the energy storage proposals
being issued by utility regulators, including California, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), Province of
Ontario and South Korea."

"Markets are emerging for low-cost devices capable of integrating and managing AC and/or DC inputs and
outputs from multiple renewable and conventional energy sources. We see evidence that our ability to
rapidly engineer power electronics that solve key customer needs is giving us opportunities for our
intelligent voltage regulation and EnerSection type devices. As the need for products for smart grid and
smart buildings segments accelerate, we will continue to introduce leading edge solutions."

Financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2012 included:

-- Product sales decreased 72% to $761,456 from $2,748,007.
-- Engineering and development revenues increased from $0 to $200,000.
-- Product sales gross profit of $206,998 compared to $482,801 in the prior

year quarter.

-- Net loss improved to $2,158,969 compared to $3,083,457. The decrease in
net loss is due primarily to lower advanced engineering and development
and general and administrative expenses.

-- Loss per share improved to ($0.13) from ($0.20).

Financial results for the six month period ending December 31, 2013 compared to the six months ended
December 31, 2012:

-- Product sales decreased 58% to $1,830,578 from $4,353,145.
-- Engineering and development revenues decreased 8% to $200,000 from

$218,183.

-- Product sales gross profit of $678,720 compared to $595,547 in the prior

year period.

-- Net loss improved to $4,755,760 compared to $5,966,247. The decrease in
net loss is due primarily to lower advanced engineering and development
and general and administrative expenses.

-- Loss per share improved to ($0.27) from ($0.39).

Financial Position
The Company's backlog (including payments due under the Lotte R&D Agreement and Amended License
Agreement) as of December 31, 2013 was $8.8 million. The Company ended the second quarter of fiscal
2014 with total assets of $10.9 million, including $600,502 in cash and $283,051 in accounts receivable.
Anticipated collections in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 associated with current backlog and current
accounts receivable are anticipated to be approximately $3.5 million. The current rate of cash consumed
by operating expenses is approximately $1,000,000 per month.
The Company believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2013, expected
collections on the Lotte R&D Agreement and Amended License Agreement, and other potential sources of
cash, will be sufficient to fund current operations through the end of fiscal year 2014. However,
unexpected delays in payments could cause short-term gaps in cash for funding operations. Accordingly,
the Company is actively seeking funding alternatives including conventional lines of credit, sale of
property and other short-term funding sources to provide appropriate cash availability in case of
unforeseen cash receipt delays.
In addition to the short-term cash funding alternatives, the Company continues to aggressively pursue
additional sales orders and other sources of funding, including expansion of contract engineering and

Page334of340©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.development programs through strategic partners. The Company is currently in active discussions with
several parties regarding potential strategic partnership and/or license and development transactions.

"I expect our order flow to remain very uneven in the near-term as we continue to roll out our
go-to-customer strategy. Meanwhile, we will continue to work with our partners, including Cummins
Crosspoint and those based in China and South Korea, to obtain additional orders and bid for additional
projects. We will also continue to aggressively pursue additional strategic partner transactions with the
goals of securing required funding and expanding our channel opportunities," Mr. Apfelbach concluded.
Conference call -- February 13, 2014 -- 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (3:30 p.m. CT)
The Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, February 13, 2014 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time
(3:30 p.m. Central Time) to discuss results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013. To
participate in the call, please dial 1-888-427-9411 for domestic callers and-1-719-325-2452 for
international callers. The participant passcode is 6053629.
