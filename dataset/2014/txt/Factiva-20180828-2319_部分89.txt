Codelco, the world s biggest copper producer, said it expects China to emerge from the Qingdao port
scandal with better rules for backing loans with commodities. I agree this is an important problem, it s an
institutional problem, Chairman Oscar Landerretche said in an interview in London yesterday. We have
all the faith in the world that the Chinese authorities will clean up the mess.

million tons now, Chairman Oscar disclosed.

The London Whale By Patricia Hurtado | Updated Oct. 21, 2014 The trader known as the London Whale
lost at least $6.2 billion for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in 2012. That s a lot of money until you remember
that it didn t stop the bank from earning a record profit of $21.3 billion the same year. The pain came
elsewhere: Two former traders face criminal charges, the bank admitted violating securities laws and
agreed to pay fines of more than $1 billion, along with a US Senate subcommittee a scathing report .

ANZ Commodities...(Oct21) Bulk commodities were stable to firmer; with iron ore prices landed China
up 1% to USD81.60/tonne. January 2014 rebar futures also found support yesterday, rising 0.4%. The
record large gap in rebar futures to physical prices still remains, with spot prices trading at a
USD60/tonne or 14% premium to futures. This points to rebar futures being oversold and should provide
some support to rebar futures prices near term.
Base metals were weaker, with nickel the worst performer. Copper prices fell as investor sentiment
remains nervous on both the supply and demand situation in China. Last week copper inventories rose
17.5% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, while a Reuters poll showed expectations for China s third
quarter economic growth to slow the most in five years.
Crude oil markets were weaker, with WTI prices down by less than Brent. A report released by the US
Government Accountability Office stated US consumers could benefit by savings on gasoline prices if the
ban on crude oil exports was lifted.

Agriculture markets were mixed, with price volatility generally subdued. The exception was Arabica
coffee which fell 5% on rain through the coffee growing belt in Brazil. The latest weekly CFTC data

long 88,668 contracts, with large weekly net long increases also in soymeal, soybeans and wheat.
