Stocks in Australia and Tokyo fell Wednesday on worries about global economic growth, although losses
were held in check by signs of economic improvement in China.

The Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.2% to 16167.45, its fourth loss in six trading days.

"Investors will be naturally averse to place bets on risky assets after an overwhelmingly negative
overnight session in both the U.S. and Europe, but the dollar's continuing strength will help Japan stocks
weather a major fall," said Hiroichi Nishi, SMBC Nikko Securities' general manager for equities.

The dollar was changing hands at ¥108.64 in Asian trading, down from ¥108.88 late Tuesday in New
York. In New York Wednesday morning it was at ¥108.72.
In Tokyo, Starbucks Coffee Japan rallied 4.4% on news that its parent, Starbucks, will buy the remaining
60% of the unit it doesn't own.

Shares of Japanese component makers that supply Apple outperformed the broader market on news that
Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cellphones have sold about 10 million units since their Sept.
19 debut. Murata Manufacturing rose 1.4%, while Alps Electric added 1.8% and Japan Display Inc. rose
1.9%.
Firms affiliated with Japanese text messaging companyLine Corp. fell after Line canceled plans to go
public. Game developer Ateam skidded 8.7% and entertainment-content distributor M-Up slid 8.2%.

In Sydney, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.7% to 5375.80, resuming a decline for the month and eating
into Tuesday's gain. Banks led the broad selloff on weakness in the local currency and the possibility of
regulatory steps to cool the country's property market.

The Reserve Bank of Australia raised the possibility of adopting additional measures to reinforce sound
mortgage-lending practices, particularly for loans to investors.

Commonwealth Bank dropped 1.1%, National Australia Bank was down 1.4% and Westpac Banking and
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group were both off 0.9%.

Investors were also attuned to disappointing economic news out of Germany on Wednesday, where
business confidence fell to its lowest level in more than a year in September, dimming prospects for
Europe's largest economy to rebound from an economic contraction in the second quarter. That added to
a eurozone report released Tuesday showing a slowdown in manufacturing and services activity.
Still, losses in Asia were limited by slightly better news released Tuesday in China, where a gauge of
manufacturing activity ticked higher in September. The Hang Seng Index rose 0.4% to 23921.61.

expectations for China to play a bigger role in curbing global carbon emissions. Chinese Vice Premier
Zhang Gaoli said Tuesday that China would make a greater effort to address climate change.

The Shanghai Composite rose 1.5% to 2343.57.

Brokerages were among big gainers as investors bet on solid earnings growth in the sector because of
an imminent start of the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock-connect program in October.

Both Changjiang Securities and Western Securities rose to the 10% daily maximum and Everbright
Securities added 4%.

In Mumbai, India's S&P BSE Sensex slipped 0.1% to 26744.69 after the country's highest court ordered
the cancelation of most coal-mining licenses given since 1993, dragging down stocks of metals
companies as well as lenders.

Last month, the court had termed these licenses illegal, saying that they were handed out in an arbitrary
and non-transparent manner.

"The verdict has dampened the positive business sentiment to some extent," said Vivek Mahajan, head
of research at Aditya Birla Money.

Jindal Steel & Power fell 10%, while Hindalco Industries recovered much of its early loss to end the day
down 0.5%. The two companies lost their licenses and may now have to buy costlier coal from state-run
miner Coal India, or import the fuel. GMR Infrastructure fell more than 10%.

Coal India climbed 5% and was the top gainer among the Sensex, as demand for its coal is expected to
increase. India allows only Coal India to mine for commercial purposes. The mining licenses given to
others are for use of coal only for their own businesses.

State-run banks also declined as a fallout of the ruling. Analysts said their bad loans may rise as the
finances of metal and power companies could weaken because of losses on investments already made
in these mines.

Bank of India lost 5.6%, Punjab National Bank fell 4.3% and State Bank of India declined 2.7%.
