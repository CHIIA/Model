SYDNEY--Australia's Mineral Resources Ltd. admitted buying a large stake in iron-ore prospector
Aquila Resources, but quelled speculation it was planning a rival takeover bid to the one led by
China's Baosteel Group.
Mineral Resources--which confessed to being the mysterious buyer of a 12.8% stake in Aquila on
Wednesday--said it made the purchase chiefly to get a foothold in Aquila's 7.4 billion Australian dollar
(US$6.9 billion) iron-ore project.

Baosteel's bid, made in partnership with Australia's Aurizon Holdings, values Aquila at A$1.4 billion.
The deal, if completed, would help support China's long-term industrialization by securing a major
supply of the crucial steelmaking ingredient.

There had been speculation Mineral Resources may look to partner up and launch a rival bid. But on
Thursday, the company said it wanted to cooperate with Aquila and Baosteel on developing Aquila's
facility in resource-rich Western Australia state.

Mineral Resources said it had already drawn up a development plan, according to which it would
manage all processing and mine-related infrastructure for the project, as well as the supply chain all
the way through to ship-loading.
Some saw the company's step to become a key shareholder in Aquila as mainly defensive. "If
Baosteel is in control of the port-contracting process it may become an all-Chinese affair, with Mineral
Resources being shut out completely," said Mike Harrowell, resources director at Sydney-based broker
BBY. "Hence, the need to get inside the tent."

Aquila's shares fell as much as 3% on Thursday to A$3.49 as hopes of a rival bid subsided. The
shares, however, are still trading above the Baosteel-led bid's A$3.40-a-share offer, potentially
weakening its appeal. Aquila, whose directors including executive chairman and co-founder Tony Poli
hold 37% of the company, hasn't so far responded to Baosteel's proposal.

Mineral Resources paid A$3.75 each for its Aquila shares, which could conceivably be combined with
the directors' holdings to act as a blocking stake. "We have the financial capacity to make a
meaningful capital contribution toward the development of the project," Chris Ellison, chief executive of
Mineral Resources, said in the company's statement.

BBY's Mr. Harrowell said given Mr. Poli's previous demand for a higher price, a bid from Baosteel at
A$3.75 or above was increasingly likely--"once Mineral Resources' position has been negotiated."
Baosteel, which owns China's largest listed steel mill, bought 15% of Aquila in 2009 when iron-ore
prices were rising, and later raised its stake to 20%. It was attracted to Aquila's plans for the project in
the mineral-abundant Pilbara region eventually to produce more than 30 million metric tons of iron
ore a year.

Under its proposal, Baosteel would own as much as 85% of Aquila, which also has an undeveloped
coking-coal prospect in the eastern state of Queensland. Rail-freight hauler Aurizon would take the
remaining interest.
