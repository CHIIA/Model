CONTINUES ITS UP/DOWN ACTION TO STAND STILL

Our market after a surprise rise yesterday of 26 points following a fall of 27 points on the last day of May
closed down a surprise 38.8 points to 5479 today although markets in the US, UK, Europe, Japan, China
and Hong Kong rose.

While our market is basically standing still on a lack of clear direction, the relentless gains in the US,
Europe and Japan - all with fragile economies but lax monetary systems - is also hard to understand.

Banks were the main weight on the index, but all sectors were weaker. Volume was average at $3.9
billion. Aussie 10 year bond yields rose 7 points to 3.72%, perhaps after the RBA signalled no change
ahead for interest rates (vs a hike in a few months widely expected). The $A is at 92.70US c, up a few
from last evening.

*Decmil rose 3c to $1.78 on 730,000 shares on its report today.
*Karoon gained 109c to $3.61 on 7.3m shares after rising $1.05 yesterday on its sale of its Browse Basin
assets to Origin.

At the smaller end,

*Queen Bauxite rose 1.5c to 2.8c on 62m shares on its return to the boards.

*Tangiers rose 3c to 31c on 5.6m shares.

*At 4pm AEST the NikkeiDow futures was up 130 points to 16,070. Shanghai CSI physical was u p7.7
points to 2046.91, Hang Seng futures was up 180 points to 23,090 points. S&P futrues was down 1.5
points to 1920.30, Nasdaq futures was down 0.75 points to 3726.75. Dow futures fell 6 pointsto 16,716
