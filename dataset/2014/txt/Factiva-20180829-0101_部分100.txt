QUEENSLAND-based rail operator Aurizon has made an ambitous play to boost its footprint in iron-ore
rich Western Australia.
The former State Government-owned freight company has joined forces with Chinese steelmaker
Baosteel in a $1.42 billion bid for Aquila Resources.

If successful, Aurizon will end up with 15 per cent of Aquila, which owns 50 per cent of the West Pilbara
Iron Ore Project.
Aurizon CEO Lance Hockridge said the plan was to split the $10 billion project’s operations into a
mining company and an infrastructure company to be operated by Aurizon.
"If successful I believe that this bid would represent a major Australian-Chinese nation-building project,
one that would deliver infrastructure of national significance with significant job creation and significant
royalty flows," he said.
The proposal fits Aurizon’s plan to diversify away from just hauling coal in Queensland.

"This is a continuation of Aurizon’s strategy but it is very different in the sense that it is a bid and
ultimately a project uniquely underpinned by the involvement of the end user (Baosteel)," Mr Hockridge
said.
Aquila has several coal projects on the go in Queensland, including the $1.4 billion Eagle Downs
development, a joint venture with Brazilian resources giant Vale.

However, greater access to the WPIOP is the main thrust behind the joint bid.
Baosteel already has a 19.8 per cent stake in Aquila. The WPIOP project partners (which include AMCI
International and POSCO) will need to build a 432km rail line and huge port infrastructure to exploit the
2.2 billion tonne iron ore resource.
The initial export capacity is estimated at 40 million tonnes of iron ore a year.
Aurizon already employs 1000 people in WA and will haul an estimated 30 million tonnes of iron ore this
year.

Aquila shares surged 89 to $3.34 on Monday, 6 short of the $3.40 bid price.

Aurizon shares slipped 25 to $4.92. Evan Lucas at IG Markets said the deal was "expensive’’.

Aquila said it would consider the proposal and update shareholders in due course.
