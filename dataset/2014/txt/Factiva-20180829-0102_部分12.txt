An Australian rail freight operator and a Chinese steel company have announced plans for a $1.4 billion
joint takeover of Aquila Resources.
An Australian rail freight operator and a Chinese steel company have announced plans for a $1.4 billion
joint takeover of the WA miner behind a proposed port in the Pilbara.

If the proposal is successful, Aurizon Operations Limited will own up to 15 per cent of Aquila Resources'
shares, while Chinese-owned Baosteel Resources could have up to 85 per cent.
Aquila holds a 50 per cent stake in the West Pilbara Iron Ore project, which includes a proposal to
develop a mine and railway, and the multi-user Anketell Port near Karratha.

In a statement Aquila said it had put together a committee to evaluate the offer.

An agreement with traditional owners for use of the land on which the port will be built was signed last
week.
