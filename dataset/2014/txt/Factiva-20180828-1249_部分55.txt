2357 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australia's S&P/ASX 200 may struggle to match a 0.4% overnight rise in the
S&P 500 after a disappointing trading update from ANZ (ANZ.AU), and Telstra (TLS.AU) downgrade by
Bell Potter. ANZ's A$5.2 billion 3Q cash profit was about 6% below consensus, and the result was
propped up by lower bad debt provisions. "On the whole, the result was weaker than expected on a cash
earnings basis and also of low quality given the contribution from a materially lower bad debt charge,"
Watermark Funds Management analyst Omkar Joshi says. Bell Potter's Charlie Aitken has cut Telstra to
Hold from Buy as it nears his A$6 target, which equates to a 5% dividend yield. Geopolitical risk from
Ukraine and Iraq eased overnight and higher-than-expected U.S. jobless claims fuelled "lower-for-longer
interest rate" bets, with U.S. 10-year bonds down 2 basis points to 2.40%. Index last 5548.5.

2352 GMT [Dow Jones] Offshore accounts at five foreign brokerages place net buy orders for 100,000
Japanese shares overnight, according to traders. The premarket buying may be positive for the market at
the open, although the yen value basis of the figures is unknown. Buy orders total 5.6 million shares,
with sell orders amounting to 5.5 million shares. (bradford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

2348 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan shares may remain somewhat bullish Friday after four straight days of
gains (+3.6%), as overnight U.S. markets remained resilient along with the dollar (USD/JPY now 102.48).
Trading activity is likely to stay subdued, however, as Japan enters the third and final day of the annual
mid-summer 'Obon' holiday season, during which many domestic investors take time off. "With a stable
dollar, good earnings reports, and a few geopolitical tribulations overseas, stocks could resume their
upward trend," says Eiji Kinouchi, chief technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. "The risk of profit-taking
gets higher as the Nikkei nears 15500, however, where stiff technical resistance awaits." He puts the
index range for the session at 15300 to 15500. Nikkei 225 September futures ended yesterday's Chicago
trading flat at 15340 vs their close at 15290 earlier yesterday in Osaka. In the cash market, the Nikkei
closed up 0.7% at 15314.57 Thursday. (braadford.frischkorn@wsj.com)

2340 GMT [Dow Jones]--Bank of America Merrill Lynch is more bullish than some other brokers on
Telstra's (TLS.AU) dividend payout prospects, keeping a buy call on the stock despite its 12-year highs
that have prompted others to take a more neutral stance. Telstra is facing flatter earnings growth
because it can't keep winning new mobile customers at phenomenal rates, no matter how much more it
invests in its 4G network. Its rich capital position, however, means more cash returns and Merrill Lynch
reckons dividends will grow to A$0.32 in FY15, A$0.34 in FY16 and A$0.37 in FY17.

2328 GMT [Dow Jones]--Citi backs its Buy rating on Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AU) despite strategic risks.
"Australia has seen a sharp decline in EBIT, but this division could turn out to be the least of
management's worries going forward," the broker says. It sees downside risk to consensus expectations
of earnings recovery in Indonesia, weak Jim Beam & Cola sales, and a disappointing FY14 earnings
outlook. "Despite the short-term risks, the stock represents attractive fundamental value," the broker
says. "Structural concerns are over-done and concerns around pricing are overdone. Strategic certainty
and more upbeat commentary by management will signal the inflection point for investors to gain comfort
in the stock." CCL last A$9.54. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

2324 GMT [Dow Jones] The USD/JPY will likely trade in a 102.30-102.70 range in Asia, with
risk-sentiment improving amid fading concerns over geopolitical risks, says Shinji Kureda, head of FX

Page125of351©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.trading group at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. "People are mindful of the 200-day moving average,
which is now around 102.30," Mr. Kureda says. The pair is at 102.48 vs 102.45 in late New York trade
Thursday. Daily commercial transaction is also somewhat in favor of dollar buying, he adds. Meanwhile,
the upside will be limited amid a lack of fresh cues due to the traditional summer holiday. The EUR/USD
is tipped in a 1.3330-1.3380 range, with bias on the downside. It is steady at 1.3362.

23:23 GMT [Dow Jones] Thermal coal futures prices are falling back below $70 a ton despite a step up
in Chinese power-plant burn rates amid recent high temperatures: The first 10 days of August, Chinese
thermal coal consummation rose 4% on year to 3.6 million tons a day, says Australia New Zealand
Banking Group. The data are in line with Australian government's report released yesterday that bulk
commodity's soft prices are due to increased supply and demand from China has been stable.

2322 GMT [Dow Jones] InterOil (IOC), the U.S. company planning to build an LNG plant in Papua New
Guinea, could be a takeover target, with Exxon (XOM), Woodside (WPL.AU), Total (TOT) and Oil Search
(OSH.AU) all possible bidders, says Bernstein Research. "Exxon have the most to gain given synergies
with PNG LNG, with Oil Search being another possibility, although funding would be an issue," its
analysts say. "If Total believe in the upside reserves case, a buy-out of InterOil would make financial
sense," it adds. "Woodside who are actively looking for LNG companies in the US$3 billion-to-US$5
billion range, would also likely be interested in this asset." It has an outperform call and US$90/share
target on InterOil vs its last trade of US$57.12. (Ross.Kelly@wsj.com)

23:16 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia & New Zealand Banking's (ANZ.AU) nine-month trading update was
on the whole weaker than expected on a cash earnings basis, says Omkar Joshi, investment analyst at
Watermarket Funds Management. The quality of the bank's performance in the period was relatively low
given the strong lift it received from a materially lower bad-debt charge, he adds. The bank now forecasts
full-year bad debts being 12% lower than in fiscal 2013 against previous guidance of a 10% decline.
Joshi says this implies a bad-debt charge of A$279 million for the fourth quarter. ANZ's net interest
margin has also come under pressure. ANZ last traded at A$32.74. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter:

2311 GMT [Dow Jones] Direct marketing company Salmat (SLM.AU) has cut its FY14 Ebitda guidance
three times since November, as it continues a strategic overhaul that Credit Suisse thinks has further to
go. "We continue to see a downside risk to near-term earnings expectations from increased investment
and higher operating costs," says the broker, which has cut its price target by 9.7% to A$1.85/share.
While Salmat has long-term opportunities, Credit Suisse retains a neutral call given uncertainty around
the structural growth in online advertising and catalog volumes, and continued competitive pressures.
The broker also thinks it's too early to draw a conclusion on Salmat's ability to execute on its digital
strategy that sees the business more aligned to an IT services and integration company. SLM last
traded at A$1.76. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

18:19 EDT - Activist investor William Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, isn't known
for being shy. But he's been relatively quiet on his big bet on the common stock of Fannie Mae (FNMA)
and Freddie Mac (FMCC), an attempt to benefit from the U.S. housing recovery. That changed today
when Pershing sued the U.S. government over the changes it made in 2012 to its bailout terms of FNMA
and FMCC. So why break the silence? One possible reason: a three-year statute of limitations that
applies to FMCC. The suit, which three individual investors have joined, makes sure common
shareholders have a seat at the table. (juliet.chung@wsj.com)

18:07 EDT - Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital files a lawsuit against the U.S. government and
Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC), joining other big investors in challenging revised bailout
terms for Fannie and Freddie. But where the other suits focus on the rights of preferred shareholders,
Pershing's suit focuses on the treatment of common shareholders. At issue are the 2012 bailout terms
that force the firms to send all of their profits to the U.S. Treasury. While suits against the government
can be expensive, time-consuming propositions, they can result in victories (think of the holdout creditors
in Argentina). (juliet.chung@wsj.com)
