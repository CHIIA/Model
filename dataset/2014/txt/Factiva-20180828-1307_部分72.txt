Dollar Run Stalls as Rates, Risk and Data Moderate

The Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index (ticker = USDollar) – after its impressive run these past three weeks –
kicked off this new period on a weak footing. Following the best performance in six months, the greenback
slipped against most of its major counterparts – with a notable exception for EURUSD. Like most fledgling
trends nowadays, this currency needs more firm fundamental ground to drive it forward with broader
market conditions favoring congestion over trend. Little of that was in evidence Monday. The rate
expectations that soared last week after the GDP and FOMC decision combination find the two-year
Treasury yield (a sensitive asset and time frame to rate forecasting) 20 percent off Thursday’s high. Not
even Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker’s remarks that the market may be underestimating the timing
and pace of the Fed’s return to hikes seems to have inspired rate watchers – and unlike Fisher and
Plosser who spoke a hawkish game last week wee, he is a voter in 2015. A moderate in ‘fear’ that built up
through volatility measures last week was another off-putting development for the safe haven currency.
The FX-based volatility measure has fallen back below 5 percent. Ahead, the docket will try its hand at
stirring one of these key trends or perhaps just short-term volatility. Service sector activity readings and an
economic sentiment survey are top billing.

British Pound Advances for Only Second Time in 14 Days

GBPUSD has advanced for only the second time in 14 trading days. Though the dollar has contributed to
this impressive move, the sterling carries its own responsibility as it has dropped against most majors over
that same period. The source of this bearish performance is not difficult to identify. Just as interest rate
expectations drove the pound higher for a full year, a moderation of buoyant expectations are in turn
pulling the market back. We can see this in Gilt yields and swaps which have slipped support on six weeks
of congestion. Less-than-perfect data helped this along. Last week, consumer sentiment, housing inflation
and manufacturing activity readings curbed growth expectations. Ahead, we have the service sector PMI
for and a proprietary retail inflation indicator from BRC both for July.

Australian Dollar: Data Flow Increases with RBA Decision

The Australian dollar takes the prize for top fundamental driver this week. Off to an aggressive start, we
have already seen July inflation statistics from TD cool (2.6 percent from 3.0), June retail sales beat (0.6
percent versus 0.3 expected) and this morning’s service sector activity gauge rise (49.2 from 47.6). This is
a robust mix of data for the economy – tempered inflation and improved growth. However, Aussie dollar
traders want more. They want rate hikes. We won’t see that at today’s RBA decision, but we may see a
commentary to suggest a time frame.

Euro Performance Doesn’t Match Yields after Portuguese Bank Bailout

Page254of417©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Crisis averted…at least some markets seem to think so. Over the weekend, Portugal’s Banco Espirito
Santo was rescued. A €4.9 billion bailout would still saddle shareholders and junior creditors with losses
rather than force a bail-in scenario where depositors and senior debt holders were spared (only possible
because general market conditions are steady). Portugal’s 10-year bonds rallied on the news, but the
optimism didn’t spread much further. Eurozone equity indexes and sovereign yields were mixed, while the
Euro edged down.

New Zealand Dollar Volatility Expectations on Employment Data Release Moderate

Rate expectations built the Kiwi dollar up, and their moderation is now keeping it anchored. For rate
expectations, swaps maintain the market is only pricing in a 4 percent probability that the next RBNZ
decision will realize the 5th consecutive hike. That compares to the 86 percent chance priced in going into
the previous meeting. Since the central bank lifted rates to 3.50 percent a week-and-a-half ago, the kiwi is
down against all major counterparts (0.1 percent versus the CAD to 1.7 percent against the USD). Though
a pause is likely, the hawkish regime is not likely over. That said, data like theupcoming employment
figures for 2Q will play an important part in stabilizing the currency. The jobless rate is expected to have
dropped to a 5.8 percent, five-year low while wage growth is seen recovering to 0.5 percent growth.

Emerging Markets: Russia to Offer Economic Update, India a Rate Decision

Following Thursday’s sharp drop in Emerging Markets – a victim of the broad risk aversion swoon – the
segment’s capital markets but in for a strong Monday performance. The MSCI Emerging Market ETF
jumped 0.9 percent for the biggest advance in two weeks; while the Bloomberg’s sovereign bond index
was far more restrained in its own effort. Amongst the currencies, performance was more mixed. The
South African Rand rose 0.2 percent and Turkish Lira advanced a modest 0.1 percent. On the opposite
side of the balance, the Argentine Peso dropped another 0.3 percent to a recent record low following its
default while the Mexican Peso edge 0.1 percent lower. Ahead, the focus will be on the Indian Rupee and
Russian Ruble. An Indian central bank rate decision and Russian PMI figures present distinct event risk.
Gold Speculative COT Interests Slip, Futures Trading Hits 5 Year Low
A 0.4 percent drop from gold to open the new trading week doesn’t exactly suggest the bears are in
charge in a meaningful way. However, there are other aspects to its performance that suggest the bulls
are pulling back their support. From price alone, the metal closed in the red 8 of the past 10 active trading
session. On the positioning side, last week’s Commitment of Traders report from the CFTC showed
futures speculators eased back 4.8 percent from July’s 18-month high. Meanwhile, the FXCM SSI showed
long interest amongst retail traders jumped 69 percent from last week. More generally, open interest
behind the market is fading – or perhaps shifting. As general activity – measured by the ATR – rises, open
interest behind the gold futures market has dropped to a five-year low. Traders want volatility.**Bring the
