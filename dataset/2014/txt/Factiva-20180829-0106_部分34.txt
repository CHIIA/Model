Operations

While the total recordable injury frequency rate decreased to 13.49 (December quarter: 19.1), one
recordable injury occurred during the quarter.
Mining continued in both pit 1 and pit 2 during the quarter. Extra mining capacity was utilized to
accelerate prestripping activities in pit 2. This enabled ore to be accessed more quickly to partially
compensate for the underperformance of the pit 1 orebody at depth (Australian Securities Exchange
announcement March 3, 2014). Road and rail haulage volumes for the quarter were adversely impacted
by both reduced availability of ore for transport and heavy rainfalls which resulted in 61.5 hours of lost
road access.
A total of 450,344 tonnes of ore were shipped in six shipments, which was in line with the company's
expectations. Six shipments are forecast for the June quarter.

For the March quarter, FOB costs averaged $84 per tonne shipped and $104 per tonne CIF (December
quarter: $94 and $111, respectively). The fall in costs per tonne was attributable to the six shipments in
the March quarter compared to five shipments for the December quarter.

FOB costs per tonne shipped for the remainder of the 2014 financial year are forecast to average $84 per
tonne shipped ($106 per tonne CIF). These costs are slightly higher than previously reported for the
remainder of the 2014 financial year due to the June, 2014, quarter expecting six shipments instead of the
previously forecast seven shipments. The company continues to operate with increased rail capacity in
order to recover some of the capacity lost due to technical issues with locomotives and wet weather in
2013.
Operations cash flow
The Cairn Hill JV had negative cash flow from operations of $1.3-million (December quarter: positive
cash flow of $8.1-million). This is a timing issue only as the provisional invoice cash receipt of
$8.6-million for the final shipment of the March quarter which departed on March 30, 2014, was received
on April 3, 2014. Had the cash for this shipment been received during the March quarter, the cash flow
would have been in line with the $6.8-million forecast in the December quarter.
The iron ore price and Australian/U.S. exchange rate fell during the provisional pricing periods and the
resulting provisional price received per tonne of magnetite-copper ore shipped during the March quarter
was $127 per tonne CIF (December quarter $127 per tonne CIF). Hedges of the Platts 62-per-cent
benchmark price resulted in a positive $900,000 impact on cash flow during the quarter.

Page76of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.During the March quarter, the Cairn Hill JV made payments of $2.7-million for adjustments on final
invoices, $1.2-million of which related to payments for shipments in the December quarter. At spot prices
and exchange rates on March 31, 2014, payments for adjustments on final invoices due for settlement in
the June quarter are estimated to be $7.3-million. This large settlement amount is due to a combination of
falling iron prices and low copper grades of the final two shipments of the March quarter.

Stockpiles
At the end of the March quarter, the book value of ore stockpiles, being the cost to deliver the stockpiles
to their present location, was $9.9-million (Dec. 31, 2013: $12.9-million). The decrease in the book value
of ore stockpiles was due to lower tonnes mined, which resulted in a drawdown of stockpile levels in order
to achieve six shipments for the quarter.

Continuity of operations at Cairn Hill

Phase 2

During the quarter, the Cairn Hill JV partners approved a phase 2 extension of the Cairn Hill mine that will
see it continue operation through to mid-2015 (see ASX announcement April 1, 2014).
The phase 2 extension will initially comprise the mining of two new open pits (pits 3 and 4) located to the
east of the current pit 1, with production of over one million tonnes of product. There is potential to further
extend the life of the Cairn Hill mine with a cutback to the existing pit 2.

Based on consensus economics forecasts for the first half of 2015 of $115.50 (U.S.) per tonne for the
62-per-cent Platts iron ore index and an Australian/U.S. exchange rate of 0.86, financial modelling
indicates that together with phase 1 operations, the phase 2 extension is expected to generate posttax,
free cash flow of approximately $8.0-million for the Cairn Hill JV.

Owing to the especially coarse nature of Cairn Hill magnetite, existing customers have been able to
produce very high-grade magnetite concentrates which are highly desirable as feed to the steel-making
process. As a result, the intermediate product from phase 2 is particularly attractive, with an existing
customer having provided a letter of intent to purchase up to 100 per cent of the phase 2 product under
an agreed pricing model based on the 62-per-cent Platts iron ore index.
Built on the current mining operation and infrastructure that is already in place, the phase 2 extension is
part of IMX's broader strategic vision to establish a minimum five-year life at the Cairn Hill mine.

Hematite exploration
Exploration for direct shipping ore hematite is an important element of the company's efforts to maintain
continuing operations at Cairn Hill beyond 2015. Any discovery of economic DSO hematite at Mt. Woods
has the potential for near-term production utilizing the road, rail and port infrastructure currently used by
the Cairn Hill mine.

Results of a pilot drilling program to test hematite at Mt. Woods that was carried out in March, 2014,
returned wide intersections showing hematite derived from alteration of a magnetite iron formation (see
ASX announcement March 1, 2014, and March 21, 2014). These results show that hematite-forming
geological processes occur at Mt. Woods and that the exploration methods applied in the pilot drilling
program can detect it. Since announcing these exploration results on March 1, 2014, and March 21, 2014,
IMX is not aware of any new information or data that materially affect the information included in that
announcement.

Exploration for this style of hematite mineralization was given added impetus by the identification of a
significant occurrence of high-grade hematite from previous drilling at the Mt. Woods project. The

Page77of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.intersection was identified in core drilled by former partner OZ Minerals Ltd., which was exploring for
copper (see ASX announcement April 4, 2014). Assaying of the hematite-rich interval returned 8.4 metres
at 59.1 per cent iron from 406.7 metres.

Since announcing these exploration results on April 4, 2014, IMX is not aware of any new information or
data that materially affect the information included in that announcement.

This intersection at Fyans is too deep and narrow to be of direct economic significance, but clearly
demonstrates that the geochemical processes that created Arrium's hematite mineralization at Peculiar
Knob were also active on the Mt. Woods tenements.

The Fyans prospect is located approximately 11 kilometres southwest of Peculiar Knob.

Mt. Woods magnetite project, South Australia (IMX 100 per cent)

Investigation into optimized product handling solutions, particularly around the port were completed during
the quarter, with concept designs developed for changes to infrastructure.
The spring flora and fauna baseline survey for the Snaefell site was also finalized, with the fieldwork
having been completed during the December quarter. This survey was undertaken to ensure that
environmental baseline studies did not impact on the critical path for project permitting.

The process to secure a partner for the evaluation and development of the Mt. Woods magnetite project
continued during the quarter. Azure Capital continues to advise on the process, with a number of potential
partners currently engaged at various stages of review.

Exploration
Nachingwea property, Ntaka Hill (IMX 100 per cent)

Joint venture with MMG
Having entered into a five-year, $60-million (U.S.) joint venture agreement with MMG in September,
2013, MMG immediately commenced financing and directing exploration at the Nachingwea project. MMG
is targeting a resource in the order of 400,000 tonnes of contained nickel at greater than 1.5 per cent
nickel and has implemented a new exploration program, focussed on delineating high-grade, mafic
intrusive-style nickel mineralization, which is considered to have the potential to increase the grade and
size of the existing resource.

Stage one progressing well

The stage one work program defined by MMG and which commenced in September, 2013, has a budget
of $10-million (U.S.), with rapid evaluation of the potential for high-grade nickel discoveries and
achievement of MMG's resource target, the primary objective.

In late 2013, MMG commenced a number of geophysical surveys to further highlight the potential within
the Ntaka-Lionja corridor, including NSAMT (natural source audio magneto-tellurics), MLEM (moving loop
electromagnetic) and infill gravity surveys. Relogging of oriented drill core and reassessment of downhole
EM surveys have continued and along with the surface geophysical work, are providing a new
understanding of the Ntaka intrusive.

Identification of drill targets is expected to be finalized in April, prior to the commencement of drilling in the
June quarter.

New zone of mineralization identified at Ntaka Hill

Assay results received during the March quarter confirmed a new zone of mineralization, referred to as
Ntaka Kati, located 300 metres north of the current Sleeping Giant and Zeppelin resource (see ASX

Page78of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.announcement Feb. 24, 2014). Two holes were drilled, each of which intersected mineralization, with
assay results including:

- 71.5 metres of nickel mineralization, including 41 metres at 0.40 per cent nickel, 16 metres at 0.5 per
cent nickel and 14.6 metres at 0.7 per cent nickel within 150 metres of the surface (NAD13-388);

- 7.3 metres at 1 per cent nickel and 5.9 metres at 0.6 per cent nickel (NAD13-387).

Since announcing these exploration results on Feb. 24, 2014, IMX is not aware of any new information or
data that materially affect the information included in that announcement.

The discovery of Ntaka Kati continues to demonstrate the potential for the various zones of mineralization
at Ntaka Hill to form part of a much larger mineralized system up to 1.5 kilometres wide.

Nachingwea regional exploration

While primarily focused on the Ntaka Hill nickel sulphide project to identify a resource in the order of
400,000 tonnes of contained nickel at greater than 1.5 per cent nickel, MMG is also looking at the broader
Nachingwea project area which covers 6,800 square kilometres (tenements granted and under
application).

Regional targeting for a virgin nickel sulphide discovery is based on an interpretation of a detailed
aeromagnetic/radiometric survey flown in 2010, an extensive regional soil sampling program and a
number of airborne EM (VTEM) surveys which cover approximately 60 per cent of the Nachingwea project
area.
Mt. Woods copper-gold exploration, South Australia (IMX 100 per cent)

OZ Minerals completed its withdrawal from the Mt. Woods exploration JV during the December quarter,
with all mineral rights over the Mt. Woods tenements and interest in those tenements now 100 per cent
owned by IMX.

The prospectivity of the Mt. Woods tenements, together with the availability of a significant exploration
database established during previous exploration work, makes this an attractive opportunity for iron oxide
copper gold discoveries in the world-class Gawler craton mineral province.
A process to secure a joint venture partner for non-iron exploration on the Mt. Woods tenements
commenced during the December quarter and is continuing. A number of parties have expressed an
interest in non-iron exploration at Mt. Woods and several Australian and international copper-gold
explorers and producers are actively engaged in the process.

Corporate

Cash position and distributions

The Cairn Hill JV cash balance is the working capital required to finance the operation. Distributions to the
JV partners are made so as to retain a cash balance of at least $3-million at all times.

As at March 31, 2014, IMX's Tanzanian subsidiary Ngwena Ltd. held $100,000 of cash on behalf of MMG.
This cash will contribute toward its expenditure on the Nachingwea JV.
Distributions to the Cairn Hill JV partners amounted to $4.3-million, of which IMX received $2.1-million
(December quarter $11.9-million, IMX share $6.1-million).

In order to provide greater certainty in respect of cash flow from the Cairn Hill mine, price protection was
put in place for 90 per cent of the group's iron ore exposure from January to March, 2014. The
transactions entered provided a price for the 62-per-cent iron ore benchmark of $146.59 (January),
$144.16 (February) and $136.52 (March) significantly above the spot prices that would have been
achievable.

Appointment of managing director and non-executive director
During February, Dr. Fisher, a highly credentialled mining executive with over 40 years experience in
mining companies, spanning both corporate and operational roles, with a particular emphasis on iron ore
and nickel projects, was appointed as a non-executive director. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, Dr.
Fisher was appointed chairman of the company.

Immediately following the end of the March quarter, Mr. Sutherland was appointed managing director. Mr.
Sutherland will drive IMX's iron ore growth strategy, based on its 51-per-cent-owned Cairn Hill mine and

Page79of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.portfolio of development and exploration projects, including the 100-per-cent-owned Mt. Woods magnetite
project.

In parallel with Mr. Sutherland's appointment, IMX has decided to relocate its corporate head office from
Perth to Adelaide, a move which is consistent with the company's focus on its South Australian iron ore
assets and will enable consolidation of its operational and corporate teams in one location. While this will
result in some one-off costs being incurred during the June and September quarters, it is expected to
deliver significant savings in recurring overhead costs.
