If you believe the rumours, a penthouse in London's One Hyde Park, billed as Britain's most
expensive residential property, sold for a record £140 million earlier this year. Surely this makes the
$15 million asking price for the Eliza penthouse an absolute steal. Opposite our very own Hyde Park
and sharing digs with only 18 other dwellings, the penthouse spans 460 square metres over three
lavish levels.

Can't wait while developer Ceerose completes the final touches? Then you might consider this
whole-floor apartment now available on level 11 for one-third of the price. If you're going to live in the
very heart of the country's busiest city, it helps to have restful views over the treetops of Hyde Park to
the majestic St Marys Cathedral and the patchwork of homes making up Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The balcony comes with glass concertina doors which, when extended their full length, create a fully
enclosed outdoor room perfect for taking advantage of the space in inclement weather.

Inside, the list of luxury inclusions is suitably long and impressive. You'll find Calacutta marble in the
wet areas, limestone floors, Gaggenau appliances and an integrated Liebherr fridge/freezer in the
kitchen, which extends into a butler's pantry. The bathrooms feature Villeroy & Boch, Gessi Ovale and
Parisi fixtures.

Timber joinery provides a surround for the gas fireplace in the living room, and lights, blinds and the
Bose integrated sound system can be controlled by the C-Bus system. There are shadowline ceilings,
ducted airconditioning and a Miele washer and dryer in the laundry.
The property comes with two security car spaces with direct lift access to a private vestibule within
the apartment. The fourth bedroom sits within a self-contained west wing off this vestibule and could
be utilised as a home office without the need for guests to walk through the apartment.

Sydney last month, Eliza was designed by Tony Owen Partners. The architects used "liquid
architecture" to mould the facade so that each level of the building presents with its own unique curve
of glass and steel.

While there are no pool and gym facilities within the building, residents might choose to take up
membership of the health club at the Sheraton on the Park, which is right next door.

ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

Soften the bedrooms with some custom-made curtains.

SURROUNDING AREA

The Eliza has attracted a cross-section of local buyers, an ex-pat from Europe, and buyers from
China and the United States. Residents began moving into the building in June and a concierge will
soon be installed in the decadent marble-floored lobby where a curved sandstone wall has been
created in the shape of a wave.

Serviced by bus, train and light rail.

Sydney has it all - countless dining options, shopping fit for royalty, large expanses of parkland, a
magical harbour and a host of cultural centres. Living in the heart of the CBD gives city workers easy
access to the office and an overwhelming selection of leisure pursuits.
