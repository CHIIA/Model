Britain's private companies with the fastestgrowing overseas sales show what can be done when you
deliver the goods, says Richard Tyler

The summer of 2014 is unlikely to be seen as a time of great British sporting achievement, with failures in
football, tennis, cricket and rugby. But when it comes to the business side of international sport, Britain's
companies are excelling.

Be it the engineering behind motorsports, the high-performance clothing demanded by athletes, or the
innovative facilities now used to house spectators — 14 companies appearing in the fifth annual Sunday
Times HSBC International Track 200 league table are busy behind the scenes.
With the World Cup final taking place today in Brazil, London's Arena Group (No58) will be celebrating
the construction oftwo9,000 seat stands with its technology at the stadium in Sao Paulo.

Six of the sports industry companies are allied to motorsports, such as Hampshire's Formaplex (No111),
which engineers parts for Formula One and Le Mans racing teams. Others include Rapha, the cycling
clothing firm at No86 that supplies Team Sky with high-performance outfits for the Tour de France, and
LGC, the analytical labs firm at No107, that tests for doping in sports.

These 14 companies recorded average international sales growth of 41% a year for the last two years, to
secure a place in this year's ranking. They outperformed the rest of the table, where the average annual
growth was still an outstanding 36%,and ranged from19%to 364%.

The 200 firms collectively booked £8.5bn in overseas sales in their latest year, a sizeable proportion of
their total sales of £19.8bn. They employ 192,000 people, with No198 — facilities services provider OCS
Group — the single largest employer with 70,000 staff worldwide.
Engineering is the dominant sector with 41 companies, including the No1 firm Congleton's Tandom
Metallurgical, which recycles and trades scrap metal, and Express Engineering (No 52), the Gateshead
business that supplies precision machined parts to the oil and gas industry. In total there are 40
companies that feed this industry, such as Aberdeen's electrical equipment supplier Dron & Dickson
(No10). The industry's importance to Britain's economy is explored furtherby Ian Stuart ofHSBCon page 3.
Scotland is home to almost 40% of these oil and gas related companies, while London boasts 13 of the
14 media firms that feature, and northeast England has four steel-related companies among the 22 from
the region appearing in the table. The Midlands and Scotland are home to 21 firms each, southeast
England has 25, the northwest has 26, and London houses 62 headquarters.

America is the largest single trading partner, with 88 firms citing it as a main market. Over a quarter have
subsidiaries in the country, more than double the number in any other. They include digital marketing
agency Essence (No 33), which generated half its £141m sales in the US last year. The companies
typically cite Australia, Germany, France and China as their next big markets. HSBC's Dan Howlett
discusses opportunities in western markets below.

Page129of339©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Not all the companies require a large office network to prosper overseas, with Stoke-based online
bookmaker bet365 (No 90) recording the biggest absolute increase in international sales, up from
£505mto£989mbetween 2012 and 2014.

Many of the companies trade on their British heritage, including London folding bike manufacturer
Brompton Bicycle (No135), Somerset's traditional cheddar cheese maker Barber's (No 141), and Charles
Tyrwhitt Shirts, ranked at 149.

Sporting success may have been elusive this year, but the International Track 200 companies show what
great success business can achieve when clever strategy and smart execution combine awayfrom home.

FAST TRACK International Track 200 ranks Britain's private companies by fastest-growing overseas
sales. It is produced by Fast Track, the Oxford firm that researches Britain's top-performing private
companies and organises invitation-only dinners for their owners and directors to network and meet its
sponsors.

1 TANDOMMETALLURGICAL Metal processor 364.05% As mining costs have risen in recent years, in
tandemwith the world's rising consumption of metal, there has been a dramatic change in
thewaycompanies sourcerawmaterials. Prices have soared—copper alone hasmorethan tripled in value
in the last decade. As a result, electronic productsmadein Chinanowcontain upto80%recycled copper,
recovered from old mobile phones, computers and TVs. Recycling metals isaprofitable business—which
iswhereBritain'sTandomMetallurgical Group comes in.
The Cheshirecompanywas founded in 2008whenmanaging director TomMuir, 57, and commercial
director AndrewLumsden, 48—with nearly 60years of sector experience between them—merged their two
recycling companies.The following year they sold a30%stake in the business to American
technologycompany Chinook Sciences, and used the capital to buy the Congleton premises of one of the
largest aluminium ingot producers in Britain.

Athird of Tandom's £58mturnover is generated from processing metal from scrapped cars into ingots of
aluminium, someofwhich are exported to the continental automotive industry. Last year, thecompany
expanded its Congleton facility and invested£2min newequipment, and cannowproduce morethan 700
tons of alloyaweek.
The larger part of its business is scrap metal trading—Tandombuys used drinks cans, electronic
components and aluminium scrap. It began trading overseaswhenit bought its Congleton plant, though
exports were only £1min 2011whenNick Rose, 43, joined as trading director to drive international sales.
Today the majority of exports, which reached£21.9m in 2013, are scrap cables and electronics, shipped to
processors in China and India, which extract copperand other metals to sell to local manufacturers. Muir
says this mixhelps to spread business risk as these sectors are less vulnerable to a downturn than the
car industry.
China is the world's largest metals recycler and, says Muir,Tandomcould easily export 10 times
asmuchscrap to the country as it does currently, if only it could source enough suitable metal.
