DLA Piper has advised long term client Linc Energy Ltd. ("Company") on the successful offering of
US$125 million 9.625% due-2017 first-lien senior secured Notes. The notes were issued by the
Company's wholly owned subsidiaries Linc USA GP and Linc Energy Finance (USA) ("Issuers"), through
which the company is engaged in the production, development, exploitation and acquisition of crude oil
and gas producing properties in the United States. The Notes bear interest at 9.625% per annum, payable
semi-annually, and are due in 2017. The issue was part of a significant structuring of the Issuers' debt,
and the transaction involved a pay-down of first lien debt of the Issuers, and replacement of their first lien
credit facilities with the Notes. The Notes are secured by first priority liens on the Issuers' U.S. based oil
and gas assets, and rank senior to the Issuers existing 12.5% senior secured notes that were issued in
2012.

In addition to repaying debt, the proceeds of the fund raising will enable the Company to undertake a Gulf
Coast drilling program focused on its extensive inventory of new well targets and low cost recompletions
to increase production and cash flows. Stephen Peepels, partner and head of Asia-Pacific capital markets
at DLA Piper said: "Our ability to assist our long term client Linc Energy in a transaction that spanned
Australia and the United States demonstrates the success of our commitment to high quality execution of
cross-border corporate finance transactions. Our Hong Kong team was able to leverage our Brisbane,
Sydney, London and Houston offices to serve Linc Energy and its advisors on a great offering." The DLA
Piper team was led by Stephen Peepels in Hong Kong, with support of Steven Weerts (Tax) in Los
Angeles, Tony Lopez (Finance & Projects) in London, and Glenn Reitman (Corporate & Securities) in
Houston.
