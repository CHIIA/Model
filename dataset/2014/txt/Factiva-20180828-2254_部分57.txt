If the best form of defence is attack, Horizon Oil might have been stretching the point recently.

The explorer's share price has been under pressure for months, falling from 38.5¢ in July to 23¢ on
Wednesday as doubts creep into the market about its ability to fund major projects in China, New
Zealand and Papua New Guinea.

Horizon's debts (including a $160 million facility and $80 million in convertible bonds maturing in
2016) now equate to almost 80 per cent of its market cap. And at the AGM last week, Horizon
signalled it will need to borrow more next year. The 30 per cent fall in the oil price and subsequent
drop in production from Horizon's China and NZ operations won't be helping and the shortfall will
have to be milked from PNG.
But the company has been unusually silent on the status of its Stanley project recently. Is it on track
to meet its promise of commencing production in 2017? Or is that target now under a cloud? A very
black one.
There's a lot of talk going around the industry that Stanley's operator, Canada's Talisman Energy,
has briefed its partners – Horizon, but also Japan's Mitsubishi and Osaka Gas – on major cost
overruns and a delayed production start date. When will Horizon decide it's the right time to disclose
that information to shareholders?
Meanwhile Horizon chief Brett Emmett was awarded more than 3 million shares for his superb
performance overseeing the share price fall of almost 50 per cent. Cue applause.
