Essar's refining margins jump 29% over April-June
Essar Oil, India's second-largest private refiner and part of UK-listed Essar Energy, this week reported
a current price gross refining margin of $9.04/barrel for the April-June quarter, up 29% from $7.01/b in
the corresponding period last year.

During the first quarter of financial year (April-March), its 20 million mt/year (400,000 b/d) Vadinar
refinery processed 5.14 million mt of crude, unchanged from a year ago.
During the quarter, Essar Oil realized 66% of its revenues from the domestic market, it said in an
earnings statement. The company said it had about 1,400 retail outlets across the nation, with over
300 in various stages of commissioning. It said it was now working to restart diesel sale from our retail
outlets in phases.
Essar Oil CEO LK Gupta said: "Operationally we continue to do well with the refinery operating at over
100% capacity. Our capability of sourcing, blending, and processing of heavy and ultra-heavy crude,
coupled with a product mix geared towards light and middle distillates have resulted in healthy
margins."
During the quarter the company posted a net profit of Rupees 6.84 billion ($112 million), against a
net loss of Rupees 8.63 billion in April-June 2013. Net sales rose 11%, to Rupees 248.11 billion, up
from Rupees 223.58 billion.
Vitol launches Viva after completing Shell acquisition
Switzerland-based trader Vitol Wednesday launched its Viva Energy Australia business after
completing a $2.6 billion acquisition of Shell's 120,000 b/d Geelong refinery and 870-site retail
network, pledging to invest A$1 billion ($926 million) in Viva's operations.
Viva Energy, which also acquired the Anglo-Dutch major's bulk fuels, bitumen and chemicals
businesses, and part of its lubricants operations, is now the exclusive distributor of Shell-branded fuels
and lubricants in Australia. Most of Shell's downstream staff in Australia will remain with Viva.
"We expect to invest A$1 billion over the next five years so we can continue to meet more than a
quarter of Australia's fuel needs efficiently and safely," said Viva Energy CEO Scott Wyatt. "Our
customers will continue to benefit from Shell's investment in R&D and the high level of service they
have come to expect."

On February 21, Shell Australia announced that it had entered a binding agreement to sell its 120,000
b/d Geelong oil refinery and 870-service stations network to Switzerland-based Dutch trader Vitol for
$2.6 billion. The deal excluded Shell's aviation supply operations and lube oil blending and grease
plants in the Queensland capital Brisbane, which are being converted to bulk storage and distribution
facilities.

Australia's AWE has agreed to farm into a 40% stake in ROC Oil's block 09/05 in China's offshore
Bohai Bay Basin, the companies said Thursday.

Block 09/05 is in the western part of the prolific Bohai Bay, approximately 10 km (6.2 miles) southeast
of Tanggu, China's largest port. The block covers an area of 335 sq km in water depths of
approximately 5 to 10 meters.

"The block has the benefit of low drill and development costs, proximity to existing infrastructure and
attractive fiscal terms," AWE said in a statement.
Under the terms of the deal, AWE will pay ROC $2 million for past costs, 60% of the first exploration
well and 54% of the second exploration well. Should drilling costs exceed the initial gross estimate of
$14.7 million each well, AWE would then contribute at a 40% working interest.

The first exploration well, QK11-1-1, was spudded Thursday and will test a low-risk, material-size
prospect that is covered by a recently acquired 3D seismic survey. Several other prospects and leads
have been identified within the block, providing follow-up potential for the second commitment well,
expected to be drilled in the third quarter of 2015, AWE said.
ROC, which retains 60% of the block, is an established operator in Bohai Bay. The company was
awarded 100% of the block in May 2012 by state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and
CNOOC has the right to participate in up to 51% of any development.
