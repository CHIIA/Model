NSW Premier Mike Baird will have $1 billion more than he expected to spend on new infrastructure
projects after a consortium paid a knockout price for the Port of Newcastle.
In a deal that also marks a vote of confidence in the state’s beleaguered coal industry, the
consortium of Hastings Funds Management and Hong Kong-based shipping company China
Merchants has agreed to pay $1.75bn for a 98-year lease on the Port of Newcastle, the world’s
biggest coal export port.

Mr Baird, who was elevated to Premier from treasurer two weeks ago, has raised billions for the
state in selling its three main ports, a desalination plant and the state’s electricity generators, vowing
to recycle the funds into new infrastructure such as the WestConnex road linking Port Botany and
Sydney airport to the city’s western suburbs.

The “social privatisation’’ model that includes new owners with large numbers of local
superannuation fund members has been an important part of winning public support for the sell-off
and could help pave the way for the sale of the state’s electricity transmission and distribution
networks, worth an estimated $30bn.
Mr Baird described it as a “momentous’’ result that exceeded the $700 million official estimate and
would pave the way for further investment in the Hunter region. He has allocated $340m of the
proceeds to revitalise Newcastle, with a further $120m committed to develop light rail in the state’s
second city.

“The people of Newcastle and the Hunter should watch this space for further initiatives in their
region,’’ Mr Baird said.

Opposition Leader John Robertson accused Mr Baird of being out of touch with the region because
he had allocated only 20 per cent of the gross proceeds towards projects there, and failed to appoint
any of its MPs to his cabinet announced last week. “Mr Baird is simply flogging off the port and then
short-changing the Hunter,’’ he said.
