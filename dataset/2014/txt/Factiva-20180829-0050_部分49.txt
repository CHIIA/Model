SYDNEY -- A China-led takeover of Australian iron-ore mining companyAquila Resources Ltd.
faces a potential roadblock after a competitor snapped up a chunk of Aquila's shares.

A rival bid would complicate Beijing's efforts to accumulate offshore mineral assets considered crucial
to the country's long-term economic development.

Mineral Resources Ltd. of Australia on Wednesday bought at least 12.1% of Aquila at a 10% premium
to the price offered by China's state-owned Baosteel Group and partner Aurizon Holdings Ltd., two
people familiar with the matter said.
The Chinese-led bid values Aquila at 1.4 billion Australian dollars (US$1.3 billion).
Earlier in the day, Aquila had said that 50 million of its shares changed hands in a block trade carried
out at A$3.75 each, followed by additional large transactions at the same price. Baosteel bid A$3.40 a
share.
It wasn't immediately clear why Mineral Resources -- which has a market value of A$1.9 billion --
might have bought the stake. The shares would give the company a chance to influence the
development of Aquila's prized iron-ore project in Western Australia, which has an estimated
development cost of A$7.4 billion. Mineral Resources also has an iron-ore processing business that
could benefit once Aquila's project begins producing.

Aquila's shares rose to more than a two-year high Wednesday, closing at A$3.61 each -- some 6%
above Baosteel's bid. The Chinese steelmaker and its Australian partner may now face pressure to
raise their bid. They may also be wondering whether Mineral Resources is planning its own takeover
move on Aquila with an as-yet-undisclosed ally.

Mineral Resources is "dipping their toes into the water with several options," said Gavin Wendt, a
Sydney-based analyst at consultancy Minelife, which specializes in the resources industry. "It could be
opportunistic and they'll push the Chinese to pay a higher price, or they could see longer-term value in
the assets and will want to partner up in getting them developed."
Baosteel, which owns China's largest listed steel mill, bought 15% of Aquila in 2009 when iron-ore
prices were rising, and later raised its stake to 20%. It was attracted to Aquila's plans for the new
mine, called West Pilbara, which is expected to eventually produce more than 30 million metric tons
of iron ore a year.

Baosteel first announced its plan to work with rail-freight hauler Aurizon on a joint takeover offer for
Aquila last month. Under the proposal, Baosteel would own as much as 85% of Aquila, which also
owns an undeveloped coking-coal prospect in Queensland state. Aurizon would take the remaining
interest.
Aquila -- whose executive chairman and co-founder, Tony Poli, holds 29% of the company -- hasn't
so far responded to Baosteel's proposal.

mirroring other investments by Chinese companies in the mineral-rich Pilbara region of Western
Australia.

Mineral Resources, which has placed its shares in a trading halt, wouldn't confirm that it was the buyer
in Wednesday's block trade.

Baosteel couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
China has long relied on Australia for the bulk of its iron-ore imports, which are used to make steel for
things as diverse as skyscrapers and limousines. Most of the iron ore is shipped to order from large
mining companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, although a small-yet-growing supply line
comes from Australian mines bought by state-run Chinese companies in an earlier wave of deals.
Baosteel's takeover proposal underlines the company's re-emergence as a leader in China's steel
industry. It is the first state-owned mill to take up Beijing's call, issued in January, for big Chinese
resources companies to acquire more iron-ore assets abroad.

The move also highlights Baosteel's willingness to spend on new investments despite weak steel
prices and a gloomy outlook for the industry at home. Iron-ore prices recently fell to their lowest level
since late 2012, partly because of concerns about China's steel demand.
Traders have also cited concerns about an emerging oversupply of iron ore as large producers
continue to expand their Australian mines.
