*FastMarkets reported ANZ in a report saying, "We expect the $1,180/1,240 range to hold in the near
term, and view a flush lower as a buying opportunity. We look to take profit at $1,230 if market moves
allow us to enter the long position. A fall below $1,175 would suggest our reading on the Chinese
demand response is wrong and we would place a stop loss here".
