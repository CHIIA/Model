2315 GMT - Iron-ore exports from Australia's Port Hedland--the world's largest iron-ore export
hub--dropped 8.1% last month, with cargoes to China falling 8.5%. "The fall in iron-ore exports to China
in November likely reflects weaker demand after steel mills in Hebei cut steel output for cleaner air ahead
of the APEC conference," says Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar. Steel mills and
factories were temporarily closed for the high-profile Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in an
effort to reduce air pollution. Iron ore fell 1.3% to US$69.70/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com;

17:30 EST - There won't be any slowing down in deal activity in 2015, especially in the health-care
sector. A KPMG survey of M&A professionals from US corporations, private-equity firms and investment
banks says 82% of respondents planned to make at least one acquisition, while 19% expected to close
two deals and 11% plan on three deals in 2015. The increase in deal-making will stem from P-E firms
looking to put high amounts of dry powder to work and take advantage of favorable interest rates, and
corporate buyers wanting to dole out balance sheet cash in hopes of expansion and growth, the survey
says. During 2014, deal value increased at a higher rate than deal volume due to numerous megadeals.
Health care is expected to be the busiest sector next year, according to 84% of respondents, while other
hot M&A sectors will include technology/media/telecommunications; energy, oil and gas; and consumer
markets. (lillian.rizzo@wsj.com)
17:30 EST - Biogen's (BIIB) stock up about 6% after the company reported positive interim results from
an Alzheimer's drug trial, but some Alzheimer's researchers seem skeptical without seeing more data
from the trial. The study is testing the drug against placebo in 200 patients with early forms of
Alzheimer's. Interim results showed the drug reduced beta amyloid levels in the brain, and had a
"statistically significant effect on cognition" after 54 weeks, Biogen says in a brief presentation. "I would
have to see the 'statistically significant' data on cognition because I have heard this many times before in
early development," says Allen Roses, a neurology professor at Duke University. Peter Davies, an
Alzheimer's expert at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, says "it's impossible without seeing
the data" to draw larger conclusions about the drug. (Jeanne.whalen@wsj.com)

2219 GMT - The Auckland housing market in New Zealand remains tight, although turnover lifted in
November, likely due to an increase in new listings in the preceding months, says ASB chief economist
Nick Tuffley. "With new listings stalling, further lifts in house sales are unlikely. Nonetheless, demand
appears to be strong and there remains continued upside pressure on house prices." Tuffley adds the
RBNZ will remain mindful of these dynamics, particularly in light of strong net migration inflows. "The
strength in net migration and the additional pressures on demand is one of the key reasons the RBNZ
continues to hold a tightening bias. But, for the time being, given the weakness in inflation, we expect the
RBNZ to leave the OCR on hold until September 2015." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

16:55 EST - Small business lending continues to accelerate in Q4, according to the latest Thomson
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index. The index, based on new commercial loan and lease
originations by major US lenders, hit a record-high 131.8 in October, up 4% from September and 12%
from a year ago. The gains marked the first time the index has exceeded a pre-recession peak of 131.7
set in January 2007. Loan-payments delinquencies of 31 to 90 days were also down in October, to
1.25% from 1.26% in September, while severe delinquencies of 91 to 180 days remained flat. PayNet
president William Phelan says he expects ramped-up borrowing by diverse small businesses to "help
drive GDP higher" in the months ahead. (angus.loten@wsj.com)

company long known as WellPoint is making its name change official, after getting shareholder approval
on Nov. 5. CEO Joseph R. Swedish has said the re-naming is part of an effort to build the
Indianapolis-based insurer's consumer brand, as a growing share of coverage is sold to individuals
through online marketplaces. WellPoint has long used the Anthem brand for many of its insurance plans.

16:43 EST - Companies are increasingly using short, frequent "pulse surveys" to get a sense of how their
workers are doing. In the era of status updates and instant feedback, employers say short monthly,
weekly or daily polls--sometimes a single question at a time--provide data on how their teams actually
feel and catch problems before they fester. Frequent surveys are even replacing annual employee
surveys at some companies, bosses say, although other companies, such as Google (GOOGL), use
both. Some 80% of firms have conducted a survey to gauge how employees are feeling, according to
data from the Society for Human Resource Management. While most of those surveys are still annual,
workers and managers appear to be growing disenchanted with long, yearly questionnaires, studies
show. (rachel.silverman@wsj.com)

16:40 EST - Bob Evans (BOBE) posts better-than-expected fiscal 2Q earnings, but sales fall short and
company lowers the high end of its fiscal 2015 EPS and sales guidance, sending shares lower.
Company expects to see expenses from the roll-out of its "Broasted Chicken platform," increased
commodity prices and higher health care costs during the second half of fiscal 2015. While it is expecting
to see a benefit from lower sow prices. BOBE is continuing a strategic review under a newly revamped
board. BOBE slips 5.6% to $52.66 after hours. (patrick.sullivan@wsj.com)

16:39 EST - The number of businesses seeking Chapter 11 protection fell 39% in November compared
to November 2013, according to new data from bankruptcy services company Epiq Systems. The report
shows 296 Chapter 11 business bankruptcy filings in November, contributing to 4,820 of such filings
since January. That's down 22% compared to the first 11 months of 2013, according to Epiq. In recent
years, the availability of credit due to low interest rates has made it easier for financially distressed
companies to restructure out of court. (sara.randazzo@wsj.com, @sara_randazzo)

16:32 EST - The 2012-2013 drought in New Zealand continues to have an impact on sheep farming with
lamb numbers only slightly improved, according to a survey by Beef and Lamb New Zealand survey. "At
an estimated 25.8M lambs, the figure is up 1.2% on the previous spring. However, last spring was the
second smallest lamb crop in nearly 60 years." Beef and Lamb says fewer lambs nationwide are
expected to be processed during 2014-15, compared to 2013-14. "The number of lambs available for
export in the current season is estimated at 19.95M head, compared to 20.3M head last season--a drop
of 1.9%." B+LNZ Economic Service chief economist Andrew Burtt says the background reasons for lower
production are positive. "Farmers are holding on to lambs, so they can rebuild sheep numbers,
particularly in the North Island." (lucy.craymer@wsj.com; @lucy_craymer)

16:12 EST - Day follows night and dip-buying rally follows brief pullback in US stocks, elevating the Dow
Industrials to another all-time high. A better-than-expected October construction report and still-solid
monthly auto sales helped stocks maintain a higher trajectory, but with the energy sector jumping in spite
of a renewed decline in crude oil, this move had a come-hell-or-high-water feel to it. Stocks were going
up, and two straight days of declines for the S&P 500 (three out of four) would not go unchallenged.
Russell 2000 rebounds 1.3%. DJIA climbs 102.75 to 17879.55, and Nasdaq Comp adds 28.46 to
4755.81. S&P 500 ends 13.11 higher at 2066.55. (john.shipman@wsj.com)

16:09 EST - FCC's spectrum auction is now flirting with $40B, a unfathomable figure just a few weeks
ago when few analysts projected it exceeding $25B. MoffettNathanson's Craig Moffett wrote yesterday
that at $38B, the four main carriers would need to generate an additional $1.40 per month of revenue
from every person in the U.S. The wireless industry will generate close to $150B in free cash flow from
2014 to 2018, he projects, with $100B going to dividends. That leaves $50B for spectrum but the
incentive auction coming in early 2016 may mean more than $75B is actually needed. "After dividends, it
will take the big four more than five years to generate the amount required for spectrum to be purchased
in just the next eighteen months." (thomas.gryta@wsj.com; @tgryta)
