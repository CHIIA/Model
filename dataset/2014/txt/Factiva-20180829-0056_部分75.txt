Nomura in ex Japan research today said the Russia/China 30 year gas deal is a win/win deal with Russia
diversifying its markets for gas exports and China reducing its reliance on expensive imported LNG and
obtaining a stronger bargaining position vs the US/Asian LNG suppliers. "The overall annual volume of
38bcm is roughly equal to nearly a quarter of China's current gas consumption and roughly 10% of
estimated demand by 2020" Nomura says.

ABC remains an "overweight"/a "hold"/an "accumulate"/a "neutral" ..

A leading broker retained an "overweight" on Adelaide Brighton while lowering its price target from $4.23
to $4.02, seeing ABC's accounting of restructuring as unusual. The broker said the headline guidance
doesn't tell the full story. Taking benefits above the line would see a $5/6 million uplift to full year 2014
earnings. Taking this below the line however offsets some impact form loss of major customer in full year
2015. In the absence of acquisitions, special dividends likely sees 2014 estimated yield of 6.4%.

*Another leading broker with a "hold" recommendation lowered its price target to $3.51 from $3.68. The
broker said it sees ABC at fair value but believes difficult construction markets, a softer outlook for lime
demand and the prospect of further adjustments from new MD Brydon may prompt caution. "The yield of
more than 5% is again a positive and is likely to provide some share price support i our view" the broker
said in the report.

*A leading broker with an "accumulate" on ABC lowered its price target to $3.80 from $4.05 cutting its
earnings forecast on lower lime volumes, the challenges for the Birkenhead operation and further
corporate overhead cuts. The broker adds ABC has a strong management team and sound business
strategy while low gearing offers the possibility of a special dividend for full year 2014.

*Another leading broker with a "neutral" lowered its price target from $3.96 to $3.78. The broker said
costs have been lowered but volume remains the key. The broker also noted that the Baro Grop's 33%
stake may limit the downside.

ABC up 3c to $3.56.

Alumina is an "add", target price increased, material div expected in 2015 ..
A leading broker retained an "add" on Alumina while increasing the target price from $1.75 to $1.95.
The broker said following its April 10 report entitled "Alcoa's alumina margins expand" it has explored
Alumina's EBITDA margins in greater detail and believes it will expand considerably over the next two
years, leading to a greater ability for the company to pay dividends.
The broker forecasts Alumina's EBITDA/t margin will expand from $US45/t in 2013 to $US80/t by the
end of 2015 and expects the company to pay a material dividend in 2015, reflecting a yield of about 6%.

WPL remains an "accumulate"/a "neutral" .. sp div possibility rises ..

A leading broker retained an "accumulate" on Woodside after the pull out from Leviathan, saying this
paves the way for a special dividend that the broker calculates would be $1.58 a share. "their discussion
around capital returns and reinvestment criteria will assume extra importance at Thursday's investor's
day" .

*Another leading broker retained a "neutral" on Woodside with an unchanged price target of $42. The
broker said it expects a capital return with a special dividend possibly seeing $1.30 per share handed
back. But the company may also look at an offmarket buyback to soak up some of its $2.5 billion in
franking credits.

(At the Investors Day meeting today Woodside has said it will consider how to deploy the $2.7 bln money
set aside for Leviathan).

WPL up 76c to $41.99.

BC Iron is a "buy" ..
A leading broker retained a "buy" on BC Iron with a target price of $4.58.

The broker said it calculates that a 10% change in received LOM prices impacts BCI's target price by
25%. The broker said at BCI's $3.53 price the market seems to be factoring in a $US95/tonne iron ore
constant price. The broker said it forecasts an iron ore price of $US100 per tonne which it sees as
conservative.
"BCI is a relatively low risk (cost, operations, management) pure play Pilbara iron ore (DSO) producer
which is ex capex, is rapidly educing its debt level and in the absence of any obvious acquisition targets
is in a position to return significant capital back to shareholders (the broker forecasts a dividend yield of
9%).

BCI up 13c to $3.66.
