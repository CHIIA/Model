PALADIN Energy has bowed to persistently low uranium prices and moved to stop production at
its Kayelekera mine in the southern African nation of Malawi.

The mine, which has been in production since 2009, has been bleeding money in recent years.

The decision to put the mine on care and maintenance is expected to save Paladin up to $35
million across the next two years but also leave it able to restart production quickly if uranium
prices rise.

The decision has been complicated by the significance of the mine to the Malawi economy. The
operation represented the first commercial mining venture in Malawi's history, and accounted for
about 10 per cent of its gross domestic product.

About 60 per cent of the workforce will be cut as a result of the decision, with the 200 or so workers
to remain on site processing stockpiles and maintaining infrastructure.
Most recently, the mine was producing uranium at a cash cost of $US39.30 ($43.94) a pound,
compared with a prevailing uranium spot price of about $US35.50 a pound.
Last month Paladin sold a 25 per cent stake in its flagship Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia to
China National Nuclear Corporation for $US190m, as well as debt refinancing.
