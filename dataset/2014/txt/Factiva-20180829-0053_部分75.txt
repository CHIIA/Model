2014 MAY 31 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News --
A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMRK), a full-service precious metals trading company,
reported results for its fiscal third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2014. Fiscal Q3 2014
Highlights Revenue totaled $1.58 billion
Gross profit was $7.5 million

Net income totaled to $2.1 million

Physical silver ounce transaction volumes up 10% year-over-year Fiscal Q3 2014 Financial Results
Revenue was $1.58 billion, a decrease of 14% from $1.83 billion in the same year-ago quarter. The
decrease was primarily due to the decline in the commodity price for gold, as well as a decrease in the
volume of gold ounces sold, partially offset by an increase in the volume of silver ounces sold during the
period.
Gross profit was $7.5 million (0.48% of revenue) compared to $7.6 million (0.41% of revenue) in the
same year-ago quarter. The gross margin improvement reflects increased demand for A-Mark's
value-added products like the Gairsoppa exclusive, as well as other specialized offerings, including
storage and logistics services.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased to $4.4 million from $4.0 million in the same
year-ago quarter. The increase was due to higher administrative expenses incurred as a public company,
as well as costs associated with the retention of addition key personnel hired to grow the company's
European presence, and launch its mine off take product offering.
Net income totaled $2.1 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared $2.6 million or $0.34 per diluted
share in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in general and
administrative costs. First Nine Months of Fiscal 2014 Financial Results Revenue for the nine months
ended March 31, 2014 was $4.57 billion, an 11% decrease from $5.15 billion in the same year-ago
period. The decrease was mainly due to the decline in the commodity price for gold, as well as a
decrease in the volume of gold ounces sold, partially offset by an increase in the volume of silver ounces
sold.
Gross profit was $22.4 million (0.49% of revenue), an increase of 19% from $18.8 million (0.37% of
revenue) in the same year-ago period. The increase in gross profit and gross margin reflects the
increased demand for value-added products, and sales of higher margin unique bullion products to
distributors for marketing to the retail public.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased to $12.5 million from $10.1 million in the same
year-ago period. The increase was due to higher administrative expenses since becoming public, as well
as a one-time $700,000 favorable adjustment in the prior period.
Net income totaled $6.7 million or $0.87 per diluted share compared $6.8 million or $0.86 per diluted
share in the same year-ago period. The increase in diluted earnings per share was due to the retirement
of shares in the current nine month period. Management Commentary "While revenue in the our third
quarter followed the decline in gold commodity prices and ounce volumes, we realized a 16% gain in
gross margins driven by increased sales of our value-added precious metal products like the exclusive

Page199of266©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Gairsoppa program," said Greg Roberts, A-Mark's CEO. "Overall, our performance demonstrated our
ability to mitigate the effect of short-term fluctuations in commodity prices and deliver favorable gross
margins.

"Consumer demand for our value-added products continues to underscore the opportunity for us to
further enhance profitability by leveraging our longstanding relationships with the largest sovereign mints.
In step with this, we've expanded our value-added products pipeline to more than 25 programs, up from
14 programs a year ago.

"Our recently expanded sales team has been actively selling new turn-key service offerings to our
existing customer base, including finance, storage and delivery solutions. We expect these
complementary services to help increase overall customer retention and drive incremental revenue."
