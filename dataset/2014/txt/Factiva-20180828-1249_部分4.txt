energy: British gas giant BG Group is likely to see more competition in the auction process for its
multi-billion-dollar Queensland gas pipeline assets, as it asks for indicative offers by August 28.

Data Room has reported that Cheung Kong Group, Industry Funds Management, Hastings Funds
Management and APA Group will be bidding for the assets. Cheung Kong is believed to be bidding on
its own, while the other three will be teaming with other parties.

Banking sources said it was likely more parties would be interested in the assets.
Fund manager AMP and utilities owner Duet Group were also participating in the sale process, a
source close to the auction said. It has also been suggested that Chinese power giant State Grid and
Singapore Power could be interested.
Bankers are looking at valuations of about $3 billion for the assets, which include a 540km pipeline
that will carry coal seam gas from the Surat Basin to a processing plant on Curtis Island. The sale
excludes water assets.BG started the sale process for the pipeline assets in July. The sale, flagged
by the company as early as 2012, had been delayed a couple of times. Goldman Sachs is running
the sale.
