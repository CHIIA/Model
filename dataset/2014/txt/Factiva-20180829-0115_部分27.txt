"Ceiling will be 5433. Floor will be 5355. Close at 5390, down 13.3 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher
with the local futures contract up 18 points.

"A number of bearish tells are present, both in our market and in the US.

"Here, index leadership was bearish again yesterday in our market. And retail, the canary in the coalmine,
is struggling.

"Over in the US there are a number of index divergences and a lot of the market bellwethers I follow are
experiencing significant distribution.

"The problem is that you often don't know whether bearish tells are signalling the imminent end of the
bounce/rally or whether it is still a few weeks to months away.

"I am sticking with the view that we are caught in a downtrend to 5180 to 5250 (with emphasis on the
upper part of that range) before one final run to a high and my forecast will be largely based on that.

"But the alternative scenario of an immediate spike into 5580 to complete probably the final top is gaining
some credence.

" The ceiling will be 5433. The floor will be 5355. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5390, down 13.3 points'.

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 14.1 points to 5403.3 last evening.
