DEXUS Property Group is nearing the sale of two major office buildings in Sydney and Melbourne,
both of which the company flagged as being in due diligence at its end of year results in August.
The property arm of Chinese giant Dalian Wanda Group, which is led by that country's richest
man, Wang Jianlin, is in due diligence for the prized 201 Elizabeth Street building in Sydney for
about $400 million.

It is understood the office building, which sits on Hyde Park, could be converted into a residential or
hotel asset in the future. However, Wanda might look to reserve the building's office component as
well. At the same time, however, the City of Sydney is trying to protect some areas of the city from
going residential.
The Elizabeth Street tower is owned by DEXUS Property Group and Perron Group, which declined
to comment when contacted. Wanda could not be reached for comment.
Meanwhile in Melbourne, super fund MTAA is finalising a deal to buy 40 Market Street in
Melbourne's central business district. DEXUS, which bought the property about two years ago,
signed on Powercor Australia as a tenant on a long-term lease. It is understood MTAA is buying the
asset for about $80 million.

Many big office assets are changing hands, as landlords take advantage of strong selling conditions.
Also on Sydney's Hyde Park, BRW Rich Lister Hui Wing Mau's company has commenced due
diligence on 175 Liverpool Street. The office building is being offloaded by Singapore's GIC Real
Estate and industry sources have said pricing is close to $400 million.

Institutional investors are also chasing the Future Fund and Stockland's Waterfront Place tower in
Brisbane, with prices tipped to exceed $600 million while the capitalisation rate could end up below
6 per cent.

The state government has also received a flood of bids for the Justice Precinct in Sydney's
Parramatta. The campaign closed on Thursday and the office asset is expected to go for more than
$150 million.
