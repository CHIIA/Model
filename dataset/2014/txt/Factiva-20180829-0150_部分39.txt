LEIGH Seymour, the daughter of Queensland property tycoon Kevin Seymour, has sold a
Melbourne car park for $40 million, just over two years after buying it for $28m.
The Victoria University car park, at 300 Flinders Street, was sold to a mainland Chinese investor,
Southlin Holdings, whose child had been to university in Melbourne. The deal was struck on a yield of
5.8 per cent, Ms Seymour said.

By last year, Ms Seymour had amassed a portfolio of car park investments worth $120m after paying
$44m for Brisbane's McWhirters car park in October. Ms Seymour also owns Brisbane's Festival Hall
car park.
Cosmetic and operational upgrading had been done on the 574-bay Victoria University car park
operated by Secure Parking, and the return improved after a 10-year lease was put in place.
Ms Seymour said she earned $5m in income from the property over the two years in addition to the
$12m in profit on the sale price. ``It's not the biggest deal of the year, but it is the best return on
equity,'' said Ms Seymour, whose private development and investment company Seymour Group
manages the car parking investments.
Ms Seymour, whose father operated car parks on the Gold Coast, was listed last year in BRW's Rich
200 with a $580m fortune. Last year, Seymour Group ran the ruler over the Sydney Opera House
car park, but did not bid for the site, reportedly bought this month by Wilson Parking, owned by
Hong Kong's billionaire Kwok family, for about $80m.
Mr Seymour said Chinese interest in Australian property remained strong as mainland investors
sought to diversify out of China, while Australia was seen as producing much better returns than
could be found domestically in China's very low-interest rate environment.
Ms Seymour will next move to gain approval to develop the air rights above The McWhirters car park
in Fortitude Valley, bought on a yield of about 7 per cent. A building of about 30,000sq m could be
developed on top of the Brisbane car park, she said.
At the time of the McWhirters acquisition, Ms Seymour told The Australian that car parking
investments had worked well. The 770-bay McWhirters car park was bought from Lend Lease's Core
Plus Fund. Seymour Group sold the site, leased to Secure Parking, to Lend Lease in 2006 for
$39.75m.
