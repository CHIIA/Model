SOTHEBY’S Australia has said it will monitor the outcome of a pact between internet auction giant eBay
and its licensor, Sotheby’s, which will give the blue-chip art auction house access to eBay’s 145 million
users worldwide. The deal announced in the US this week initially will see the companies collaborate on
daytime sales of jewellery, watches, prints, wine, photographs and 20th-century design. Sotheby’s
Australia operates under licence but is otherwise independent from the international auction house
headquartered in New York (pictured in May) with offices in Hong Kong and six European
capitals.Sotheby’s Australia chief executive Gary Singer said his company specialised in sales of visual
art, Aboriginal art, decorative art and jewellery. It did not operate in the many other auction categories
where its namesake was active, so eBay was less of a corporate fit. “If the lower end (of the market)
takes off we’ll look at it as an area to move into,” he said.

eBay has been embroiled in art-sale scams where unsavvy buyers bought fakes and items with bogus
collecting histories. But Singer said the site wasn’t the problem, as “people can be silly about art,
whether they buy it from eBay or a dealer”.
