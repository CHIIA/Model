Hong Kong-listed MMG Ltd. said July 17 that it is lowering its zinc production guidance and increasing its
copper production guidance for the year.
The company produced 36,663 tonnes of copper cathode during the second quarter ended June 30, a
5% decrease when compared to the corresponding 2013 quarter. Copper-in-concentrate and
zinc-in-concentrate production was also down 15% and 11% year over year, to 6,765 tonnes and 148,156
tonnes, respectively, while lead-in-concentrate production fared well with a 27% year-over-year increase
to 26,794 tonnes.

During the first half of the year, copper cathode production increased by 4% to 76,298 tonnes as a result
of strong operational performance related to sustainable throughput and increased copper head grades
at MMG's Kinsevere copper-zinc mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

First-half zinc production was down 4% to 270,201 tonnes when compared to the first half of 2013, due to
lower grades at the company's Century zinc-lead-silver operation in Queensland, which is in the final
stages of its mine plan.
The decrease has prompted the company to lower its full-year zinc guidance to between 575,000 tonnes
and 600,000 tonnes. The company had originally aimed to produce between 600,000 tonnes and
625,000 tonnes of zinc this year, as outlined in January.

"We believe the current sentiment in zinc reflects the increasing uncertainty of future supply with the
market starting to factor in the closure of several large scale assets, including our own Century mine,"
MMG CEO Andrew Michelmore said in the statement.
MMG also increased its copper production guidance for the year, up to between 177,000 tonnes and
190,000 tonnes from 173,000 tonnes to 186,000 tonnes.
The miner also operates the Sepon gold and copper mines in Laos, the Golden Grove copper-zinc mine
in Western Australia and the Rosebery zinc-lead mine in Tasmania.
In addition, MMG is undertaking a trial stoping program at its Dugald River zinc-lead-silver property in
Queensland, and also continues to work on progressing approvals and conditions for the US$5.85 billion
acquisition of the Las Bambas copper project in Peru from Glencore Plc.
The company recently obtained a US$6.96 billion loan to help fund the deal.
