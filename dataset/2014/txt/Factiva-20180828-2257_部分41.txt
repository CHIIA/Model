Perth, Nov 24
Uranium miner Paladin Energy has clinched a 2-part, $A205M funding/recapitalisation deal to meet its
convertible bonds due in Nov 2015, with further initiatives foreshadowed for early 2015 expected to fully
fund the company to at least June 2016.

It includes a placement of ~$A61M (~$US52M) at $0.42ps to HOPU Clean Energy, one of the leading
China-based private equity companies, for ~144.9M shares, 15% of Paladin’s current capital base and
about 13% after the placement.

HOPU will also subscribe for its full entitlement under the institutional tranche of a ~$144M (~$US125M),
1-for-2 basis entitlement offer at $A0.26ps and participate in last-in-relief sub-underwriting of the retail
tranche of the offer to bring its Paladin shareholding up to a maximum 15% following the placement and
entitlement offer.

All necessary approvals have been received, including Foreign Investment Review Board approval, for
an investment by HOPU in Paladin of up to 19.99%. HOPU’s senior M/D has been offered a board seat.

Paladin says it remains on track to meet FY2015 production guidance of 5.4Mlb-5.8Mlb U3O8 from its
75%-owned Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia, which has introduced a new resin in the NIMCIX circuits,
resolving its scaling issues. The company says the new resin will reduce operating costs through
reduced reagent consumption and also increase the circuit uranium transfer capacity and overall
process recovery. Construction of the Bicarbonate Recovery Plant at Langer Heinrich is well advanced
and scheduled for commissioning in Jan 2015.

Paladin says these initiatives are aimed at putting achieving its long term C1 cost target of $US20lb at
Langer Heinrich.
