Gold - Cost reductions exceed expectations
Newcrest Mining is on track to be cash-flow positive in the 2014 financial year after the goldminer
revealed big cost reductions across its international portfolio.

Costs of production were always going to be the focus of Thursday's December-quarter results after
Newcrest revealed stronger than expected production numbers on January 15. But the cost
reductions revealed to the market were well beyond expectations, and allowed the goldminer to
operate at a company wide "all in" cost of $921 an ounce.

That result was 16 per cent lower than the September quarter and well below Newcrest's previous
goal of being cash-flow positive over the full year so long as the gold price averaged $1450 an
ounce.

Most importantly for the miner, the "all in" cost was easily below the average price that Newcrest
received for selling its gold, which came in at $1372 an ounce.

Newcrest chief executive Greg Robinson said the cost reductions had been achieved through less
intensive mining processes, a reduction in processing of lower grade materials, and a range of other
measures. "We've shown over the last three quarters that it is something that we can be successful
at," he said, before adding that the theme would continue over the next six months too.

While there was clear margin between Newcrest's "all in" costs and the received price, it remains
unclear whether the company was cash-flow positive in the period.

Certain expenses, such as capital expansions, tax, and exploration in virgin territory, are not included
in the "all in" number, and Newcrest said it would not reveal whether it was cash-flow positive until its
financial results in February.

CIMB analyst David Coates said Newcrest would be very close to being cash-flow positive based on
the numbers published on Thursday.

"We think it's going to be pretty line ball, but considering that at the start of the year people were
expecting them to blow $440 million in cash over the year, it's a big improvement," he said.

Expectations that Newcrest would lose money in fiscal 2014, combined with a high gearing ratio, had
many speculating that an equity raising could be imminent.

However, Mr Coates said that prospect was looking less likely.
With 586,573 ounces of gold produced in the September quarter and 621,125 ounces of gold in the
December term, Newcrest has already produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold so far this
year.

produce between 2 million and 2.3 million ounces over the full year.

Newcrest shares initially rose on Thursday morning, but closed the day 21¢ lower at $9.13 as the
broader market fell on weak Chinese data.
