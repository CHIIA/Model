China's official PMI for December a touch below expectations
China's official PMI has come in at 51.0 in December, down from 51.4 the previous month and below
forecasts for 51.2. Analysts at Barclays noted the pullback of activity in the survey was broadbased across
industry sectors and sizes. "Besides the need for deepening reforms and addressing structural issues
such as reducing overcapacity and controlling local government debt, we think elevated interest rates
across the money, bond and credit markets have led to higher funding costs, hurt corporate sentiment and
thus weigh on economic growth," they wrote in a client not, Reuters reported.

*HSBC and Markit release their measure of manufacturing activity later today.

Gerald Stanley, a Fibonacci Chartist, said he expects the market to hit a high of 5380, a low of 5345 and
close up 15 points to 5367 "in a cautious low volume start to the New Year".

*The S&P/ASX200 closed down 4.6 points to 5352.2 on December 31.

RP Data has reported Australian home prices continued their strong gains in December, leading to the
biggest calendar year rise in four years, ABC News said.

The average capital city home value rose 9.8% last year, the biggest calendar year rise since 2009 when
home values lifted 13.7%.

Although regional areas did not experience the same gains, lifting just 1.4% over the year.

The standout performer for capital gains was Sydney, surging an average 14.5% over the year, including a
4.1% rise over the past three months, leaving the median dwelling price at $655,250 - that is nearly
$100,000 more than the next most expensive city, Melbourne.

However, the Sydney market slowed a little in December, with prices rising an average of 0.7%.

Melbourne prices were up 2.2% in a strong last month of the year, pushing annual gains to 8.5% and the
median price to $563,000.
Perth also has strong annual returns for property owners, rising 9.9%, including a 1.3% gain in
December.

The best December gain was for Hobart, up 4.3% in the month, but that result was only enough to lift
Australia's southernmost capital from an annual loss to a gain of just 2.2%.

Adelaide also had relatively weak annual growth of 2.8%, while Darwin 3.3% and Canberra 3.5% had
modest 2013 gains.

Brisbane home prices rose 5.1% over the year, leaving the median price at $445,250.

Manufacturing back in contraction
ABC News reports the Australian Industry Group's Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) came in at
47.6 in December, down 0.1% from the previous month and below the 50-point level that distinguishes
expansion from contraction.

The index has now consolidated back into negative territory after two months of small expansions in
September and October.
The Ai Group's chief executive, Innes Willox, says manufacturing looks set for further weakness in 2014,
despite record low interest rates and a declining Australian dollar.

"New orders and employment fell further behind in December casting doubt over whether the start of 2014
will usher in a more positive outlook for manufacturing activity," he noted in the report.

"The sector, and indeed the broader economy, remains stuck behind the eight ball and manufacturing in
particular is, as yet, in no position to assume a role in generating alternative sources of growth as the
mining boom fades."

The food and beverage manufacturing sector kept expanding (at 55.8 points), as did two smaller
sub-sectors of manufacturing, wood and paper products (73.1) and printed and recorded media (59).
