HONG Kong’s Hind Group has added to its burgeoning east coast accommodation portfolio, buying
the ultra-chic 1888 Hotel in Sydney’s Pyrmont, adding to its existing hotel and serviced-apartment
complexes in Melbourne.
The privately owned group paid about $33 million for the 90-room 1888 Hotel, the brainchild of Paul
Fischmann’s 8-Hotels Group — buying the property on the edge of Sydney’s CBD with a long-term
management agreement in place. The 1888 Hotel has been on the market for several months. It was
not known whether Hind Group — which bought Melbourne’s 150-room Oaks on Lonsdale
serviced-apartment complex in a deal worth more than $70m last year — would retain the
management agreement. Mr Fischmann declined to comment.

Hind Group is not the only Asian business intent on buying into Australia. Chinese giant Greenland
will next year open a hotel on Sydney’s Pitt Street called Greenland Primus Hotel, while Singapore’s
Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts bought a site on the Gold Coast last week for a 40-level $107m hotel
and serviced-apartment complex. Banyan Tree chairman Ho Kwon Ping will spend the next few weeks
scouring Brisbane and the Gold Coast for more sites.
Hind Group, which began life in 1918 as a textiles maker in Myanmar before moving to Hong Kong in
the 1960s, has now accumulated three assets in Australia, including the Ovolo Hotel on Melbourne’s
Little Bourke Street.
There has been more action in Sydney’s Pyrmont. The commercial part of the former Festival
Mushroom Records recording studio, which is now an office building, is close to being sold to a local
syndicate for more than $20m.
The two floors of the building, at 63-79 Miller Street, were sold by listed retirement village manager
Aveo Australia, which is trying to sell out of assets that are outside its core speciality. Aveo, once
known as FKP Property Group, bought the property in 2007 for $32.75m.

The building, which is reported to have hosted the recordings of albums by Kylie Minogue, Yothu Yindi,
Cold Chisel and Peter Allen, was heritage-listed in 2001. Built in 1939, it has a net lettable area of
nearly 5000sq m and an annual income of close to $2.5m when fully leased.It is about 25 per cent
vacant. An IAG operator owns the ground floor.
