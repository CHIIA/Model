$20m home not enough

ONE of Melbourne’s most luxurious homes has been sold for $20 million to a Chinese buyer who is
keen to buy more.

Avon Court, a nine-bedroom mega-mansion in Shakespeare Grove, Hawthorn, comes with its own
18-seat teppanyaki kitchen, a wine cellar and two pools.

Throw in a gym, a sauna and the maid’s quarters, and the house — believed to have just been sold
by Autobarn chief Garry Dumbrell — has just about every luxury you could imagine.
The buyer wants two or three more — and they’re prepared to spend between $20 million and $40
million.

Paul Pfeifer, from RT Edgar in Toorak, said the appetite of foreign buyers was stretching across three
of Melbourne’s well-heeled eastern suburbs.
“I have worked closely with Chinese buyers who are looking for large property holdings in Kew,
Hawthorn or Toorak,” Mr Pfeifer said.
“I managed to place one home in Hawthorn over $20 million, but this group of buyers is wanting
three more homes on 2000sq m-plus land in Toorak.” The sale occurred during a business holiday
in Asia and Mr Pfeifer said there had been several other buyer requests for $10 million.

He expects the Melbourne record could be broken this year.
“There are certainly some property holdings in Toorak and surrounds that could achieve much
greater than $21-$22 million,” Mr Pfeifer said. “There are a number of $11-$25 million properties
sitting and waiting for the right buyer to appear.” He noted $22 million was believed to be the current
Melbourne record price for residential property.

The demand for Melbourne, and Australia’s, ultra-high-priced properties is being fuelled by the stable
Australian economy, educational facilities and the perceived safety of the Australian residential
market.

“In 2013 and 2014, we are experiencing the next wave of international interest, due to the 188 visa,
commonly referred to as the $5 million visa, which enables foreign investment, with less red tape
and obligations required to hold property in Australia with a view to become a permanent resident,”
Mr Pfeifer said.nathan.mawby@news.com.au
