OFFSHORE developers are continuing to set the pace in Melbourne and some are now turning their
attention to suburban development projects.

Malaysian developer Fajarbaru has made its first foray into the Australian market, joining players such
as Singapore’s Chip Eng Seng and Ho Bee in undertaking projects in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs.

Fajarbaru has just bought three adjoining parcels of vacant land in Doncaster for $6.9 million.
The land, 2428sq m in total, was purchased from Doncaster Regency. The site has approval for the
development of an 11-storey residential building with 136 apartments.
In a company announcement, Fajarbaru said the Melbourne market was showing “signs of
improvement after a generally flat 2012 to mid-2013, and following a significant decline in 2011”.
“In Australia, residential apartments still provide one of the most tax-effective investments,” the
announcement read.

Overseas developers have also taken an interest in Hawthorn, where The Australian understands a
Chinese developer has closed a deal on 7000sq m site on Burwood Road.
It is believed the developer purchased the site for about $30m, which was formerly owned by local
businessman Ron Hall. A Melbourne-based agency and CBRE’s city sales team have been linked to
the deal, but this could not be confirmed.
Chip Eng Seng picked up the former Morrison Brothers Nursery site in Williamsons Road, Doncaster,
for $19.28m earlier this year and says it will launch a project this year featuring 90 townhouses and 50
apartments.
The company plans to expand its property development business in Australia and will acquire more
development sites to build up its land bank, “should new attractive opportunities arise”.
Late last year, a car park behind the shopping centre at 1 Grosvenor Street sold to Ho Bee for $8.5m
and that group is now planning 185 units.
A report by Knight Frank this week said Melbourne’s metropolitan apartment market had experienced
a lift in median values and rents in the past 12 months, despite significant construction projects under
way.Knight Frank’s residential research associate director, Michelle Ciesielski, said that there were
just over 12,600 apartments currently under construction in metropolitan Melbourne, with a number of
significant projects still in the pipeline.
