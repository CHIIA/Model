Energy infrastructure business APA Group has announced the purchase of the QCLNG pipeline in
Queensland for $US5 billion ($A5.41 billion). APA said today it had entered into an agreement to buy
the pipeline which connects gas fields in the Surat Basin to the QCLNG plant on Curtis Island, near
Gladstone.

QCLNG is one of three giant projects feeding gas from onshore fields to new liquefaction plants at
Gladstone.

It comprises two liquefaction trains with a combined nameplate capacity of 8.5 million tonnes per year
supported by binding 20 year off-take agreements with Britain's BG Group, the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Tokyo Gas.

The pipeline consists of 543 kilometres of transmission pipeline, 3 laterals, and interconnections with
transmission pipelines for the Australia Pacific and Gladstone LNG projects.

Construction of the pipeline commenced in early 2011 with construction completed and first gas
delivered to Curtis Island in December 2013. The pipeline is now operational. APA will carry out a
$A1.84 billion capital raising to help fund the purchase, with the rest of the money coming from a
$US4.1 billion debt facility.
The company said it was on track to achieve its 2014-15 guidance for earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of between $A1.17 billion and $A1.19 billion, excluding the
impact of the pipeline acquisition. Managing director Mick McCormack said the acquisition would
allow the company to benefit from Queensland's growing LNG sector, which is set to become a major
exporter in 2015.
"The acquisition of the QCLNG pipeline further enhances APA's position as Australia's largest owner
of gas transmission pipelines and builds on APA's strategy of expanding its revenue base and east
coast grid," Mr McCormack added. "The acquisition of the QCLNG pipeline allows APA to obtain
exposure to the globally-significant east coast LNG sector and expands APA's contracted revenue
base with revenue from highly creditworthy counter-parties under 20 year take-or-pay contracts."
APA is Australia's largest gas infrastructure company, and its assets include the Goldfields Gas
Pipeline, the Mid West Pipeline, the Mondarra gas storage facility and the Emu Downs wind farm in
WA.
