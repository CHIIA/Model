Agribusiness - Chinese company claims it was misled over infant formula
A Melbourne infant formula maker will "vigorously defend" a $4 million lawsuit claiming it misled a
group of Chinese investors about where it sourced its milk.

Hong Feng Investments is suing Milk Powder Solutions, which employs 25 people at its factory in
Melbourne's south-east, because it sourced its milk powder from New Zealand instead of exclusively
from Australia.
According to documents lodged in the Federal Court last month, Hong Feng said it was told by Milk
Powder Solutions employee Jenny Fang in July 2011 that its milk came "entirely from the Tatura
region of Victoria".
But Milk Powder Solutions director Simon Hansford said this had never been the case.

He said Ms Fang was a clerical assistant and interpreter, and "in this instance she was pointing out
the seasonal implications of the dairy industry".
While his company sourced milk predominantly from Australia, he said, "from time to time" it used
product from areas other than Victoria, including New Zealand, to ensure continuity of supply.
"At no time has Milk Powder Solutions or any of its employees assured Hong Feng or any of our
clients that all [our] product will come from Victoria at all times."

Mr Hansford's lawyer said the Federal Court action comes almost six months after a similar claim
lodged by Hong Feng was dismissed by the South Australian District Court, and Hong Feng ordered
to pay Milk Powder Solutions' costs.
The court action began about the same time Beijing banned products from the world's biggest dairy
exporter and New Zealand's main milk processor, Fonterra, after it was discovered some of the
company's products contained bacteria that could cause botulism.
New Zealand did not have the same reputation Australia has in China for quality and safety, Hong
Feng said in its Federal Court application.
But Mr Hansford said all products his company supplied to Hong Feng qualified for use of the Made
in Australia logo, although "to our knowledge Hong Feng did not apply for the licence to do so".
He started his company five years ago after a Chinese infant formula killed six babies and put
another 54,000 in hospital after it was found to be contaminated with melamine - which causes renal
and urinary problems - in an attempt to increase its protein content.
Mr Hansford, who has 33 years in the milk powder business, having previously operated an
ice-cream and yoghurt company, said he was inundated with requests to supply milk powder to

thousands of requests asking me if I could supply them with it. I did some research and that's how we
got started."
Hong Feng was going to buy a minimum of 160,000 units of baby formula over three years from Milk
Powder Solutions. It claims it has lost a business opportunity worth about $US3.8 million.

A directions hearing is scheduled for February 7.
