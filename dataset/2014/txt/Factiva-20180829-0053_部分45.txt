Digital, also known as Canal+, a unit of media group Prisa.

familiar with the matter said on Monday.

investment.

billion in cash and had secured the financing needed to pay for its share of the $20 billion Johan

generated sales of about 140 million euros last year.

domestic outlook. Nikkei business daily, which first reported the talks, said a deal would likely top 500
billion yen ($4.9 billion).
