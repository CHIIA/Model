DULUX Mr Houlihan said the housing construction market was expected to remain strong, but added
this represented less than 20 per cent of Dulux Group's revenue.

Dulux is less positive about its commercial and infrastructure division, which comprises about 16 per
cent of its revenue.

"In Australia, the outlook for major engineering and infrastructure projects is weak as major capital
expenditure projects - particularly in the mining sector - wind down, and the pipeline of new
infrastructure projects is still some time away," Mr Houlihan said.

He expected the group to deliver an even stronger profit result for 2014/15.
Dulux had a net profit of $104.5 million in 2013/14, which represented a 39 per cent increase on the
previous financial year's $75 million.
Excluding non-recurring items such as costs associated with the acquisition of building products and
garage door supplier Alesco, net profit rose 21.4 per cent to $111.9 million.
Mr Houlihan said conditions in China and Papua New Guinea were expected to remain relatively soft.

He also pointed to softness in the garage doors and openers segment of the business, but this was
offset by growth in the paints and coatings division.
Mr Houlihan said the company would monitor the "potentially adverse impact" of a lower Australian
dollar and the favourable effects of a lower oil price.
