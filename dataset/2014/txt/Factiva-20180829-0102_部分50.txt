"We will probably close down about 15 to 20 points'

"Maree" said, "We will probably close down about 15 or 20 points. We have got our sights on the short
term and ahead of the Budget our market is not very confident. Once we know what we are dealing with
buying may pick up again, but right now it's not China, it's not the Ukraine that is dominating our thinking,
its what's going on here. There's just no interest in buying. There are a lot of unknowns, investor
confidence has gone. Meanwhile, the RBA has a problem. The high $A is holding inflation down (which
would rise if the interest rate is lowered)".

*Most recently, on April 24 a leading broker retained an "equal weight" on Macquarie Group while lifting its
price target to $60.30 from $55.90 (and up from $55.20 before MQG's March 24 guidance). The broker
said over the past six years the immediate reaction of MQG's share price to the full year result has been
driven by the outlook commentary. We expect this trend to continue and that management will guide for
profit in 2015 to be up on 2014.

The broker added, in its view consensus forecast for full year 2015 profit to be up 15% on this year vs the
broker's forecast of 2015 profit to be up 20% on this year - does not look too bullish.

*Following MQG's updated guidance on March 24 leading brokers retained "neutral" price target $50.46,
"neutral", price target $52; "outperform", price target $63; "hold" price target lifted to $57 from $56.
Company guidance: On March 24 tabled its presentation to be delivered at the Credit Suisse 17th Asian
Investment Conference in Hong Kong on March 26/27.

In its presentation to investors and analysts MQG advised since its first half result announcement market
conditions continued to show signs of improvement, however client activity remains subdued for some
capital markets facing businesses.

Macquarie's annuity style businesses (Macquarie Funds, Banking and Financial services and Corporate
and Asset Finance continue to perform well with combined December quarter net profit contribution up on
the previous corresponding quarter and the September quarter.

"Accordingly we currently expect Macquarie's result for full year 2014 to be up approximately 40/45% on
2013, subject to the completion rate of transactions and the conduct of period end reviews'

Macquarie remains well positioned to deliver superior performance in the medium term. It has built a
uniquely diversified business since its inception in 1969. It employs 13,578 people and operates in over 28
countries. Assets under management are $A433 billion. MQG is well funded with a strong balance sheet".
