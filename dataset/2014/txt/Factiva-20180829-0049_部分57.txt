side or profit taking before year end.

Meanwhile Aussie bond yields fell 9 points to 3.69% and the $A dropped 60 points on last evening to
93.52US c following the RBA minutes of its last meeting which was very different in tone, and seemed far
more worried than in recent times - signalling possible rate cuts ahead.

"Another listless day .. swinging in a very tight range .. down 10 on the day"

"Maree" said, "I expect another listless day where it can still swing either way. We are approaching the end
of the financial year, I will call it down 10 on the day, but we are just swinging in a very tight range and
closing up or down within 20 points.
"There was no real lead from offshore - there is a little risk aversion apparent. I would be erring to the side
of profit taking today".

Maree added, "Housing prices are inflated, but if the RBA cuts rates housing prices will go up further. We
do have inflation but it is kept at bay with the currency doing much of the work. But if we are attracting
overseas funds this may put pressure on the RBA to reduce interest rates to control the influx - as
Switzerland did".

The S&P/ASX200 closed up 7.2 points to 5412.3 last evening.

ECO NEWS

RBA Minutes for meeting on June 3 - leaves rates at 2.5%.

"Global and domestic economic conditions overall were little changed from the previous meeting. Growth
of Australia's major trading partners remained consistent with the earlier outlook, with growth early in 2014
around its long-run average. Based on data to hand, GDP growth in Australia in the March quarter
appeared to have been a little above trend. Much of this reflected very strong growth of resource exports,
which was not expected to be sustained at such rates in coming quarters. The expectation of substantial
falls in mining investment, below-average growth of public demand and non-mining investment remaining
subdued for a time implied that the pace of growth was likely to be a little below trend over the rest of this
year and into the next, before gradually increasing.

"Data for the labour market suggested that demand for labour had improved over the early part of the year.
Members noted that this improvement may have in part reflected some ‘catch-up’ after a period of
surprisingly weak employment growth in the previous year. Forward-looking indicators were higher than
they had been, but still at levels consistent with only moderate employment growth in the months ahead.
The spare capacity in the labour market was leading to low growth of wages, which was expected to
persist for some time.
"At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. Low
interest rates were working to support demand, although it was difficult to judge the extent to which this
would offset the expected substantial decline in mining investment and the effect of planned fiscal
consolidation. Those uncertainties were likely to take some time to resolve. The earlier decline in the
exchange rate was assisting in achieving balanced growth in the economy, but less so than previously as
a result of its higher levels over the past few months. Members noted that the exchange rate remained
high by historical standards, particularly given the further decline in commodity prices over the past month.
(Our italics)

"Notwithstanding a pick-up in growth around the turn of 2014, GDP growth was expected to be below trend
over the next year or so, rising gradually thereafter. Inflation was forecast to remain within the target.
Given this outlook for the economy and the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to
support economic activity, the Board judged that the current accommodative stance of policy was likely to
be appropriate for some time yet.

The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5%".

TOP STOCKS

*Woodside is the story of the day, last traded at $52.85, on the report below.
Analyst comment: A leading broker retained its "underweight" on Woodside saying "The transaction is
immediately earnings accretive with WPL claiming 6% EPS and DPS accretion on historic 2013 earnings,
offset by an increase in gearing from 9% to 25% for proforma year end 2013. The financial impacts in the
future years are likely to be lower off a higher earnings base... We retain an underweight rating. Despite
the improvement in near term earnings and yield metrics, in our view they are not compelling in the
absence of a positive growth overlay". The broker's price target is $40.40.

NEWS OF THE DAY

NSW Budget

ABC News reported NSW Treasurer Andrew Constance delivering the State Budget said three year of belt
tightening and fiscal discipline have put the state in a strong position but warned Commonwealth cuts to
health funding would lead to a gap of $16 billion in 2050.
He announced a budget deficit of $283 million for the 2014/15 financial year due to the Commonwealth
bringing forward more than $700 million in funding for Pacific Highway upgrades. The budget forecast for
2015/16 is for a $660 million surplus, one year earlier than his predecessor and now Premier Mike Baird
had predicted.
The bottom line was helped by the $6.7 billion windfall from the privatisation of the state's major ports and
the desalination plant. Net debt is also significantly lower than previously forecast, at about $8.6 billion.
He also outlined $61.5 billion budgeted for infrastructure projects and $1.3 billion for hospital
infrastructure.

First homeowners will be able to spend up to $750,000 on a new home to qualify for the $15,000 first
homeowners grant.
