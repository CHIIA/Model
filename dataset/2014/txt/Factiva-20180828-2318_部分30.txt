Asian stocks rose, with the regional index climbing a fourth day, while the dollar weakened before the
Federal Reserve reviews monetary policy.
US equity-index futures dropped amid an after-hours rout in Facebook, as crude oil gained with silver.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent by 9:20 a.m. in Tokyo, holding its highest close since Oct.
7. Japan's Topix index added 0.7 percent.

Futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq 100 gauges slipped at least 0.2 percent as Facebook
slid 8.2 percent in extended U.S. trade after projecting lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales.
The greenback lost 0.3 percent versus the Korean won as Australian bond yields jumped. Oil rose for a
second day as silver added 0.3 percent.

With the US economy on a stronger footing, the Fed is on track to announce the end of its bond-buying
program today, while leaving its key interest rate near zero, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg say.

The S&P 500 closed within 1.5 percent of a record yesterday amid better-than-estimated earnings and
after consumer confidence jumped to a seven-year high. Chinese confidence data is due today, while
PetroChina Co. (857), the nation’s biggest oil and gas producer, posts third-quarter results.

"Tapering will be completed, but so what? It is still too early to move on to the Fed rate-hike phase,"
Benoit Anne, head of emerging markets strategy in London at Societe Generale SA, wrote in a client
note e-mailed today. "There are always investors that fear the Fed no matter what, especially in the US,
so I would not be surprised to see a relief rally after the FOMC, albeit a small one," Mr Anne said,
referring to the Fed Open Market Committee's two-day meeting.

ignored the reported fall in US durable goods orders and instead focused on the positive US consumer
confidence number. Nickel found interest after fallen 5% this week, as concern over disruptions in NPI
output in China resurfaced. Gold prices were steady as investors await the FOMC meeting and the likely
end to the bond purchasing program.
Bulk commodities were weaker, with iron ore failing to hold gains seen earlier in the week. With
stockpiling by Chinese steel-makers slowing ahead of the APEC summit in Beijing next week, traders
were forced to lower offers to attract buyers. Thermal coal markets were unchanged despite news that
US producer Arch Coal expects US thermal coal exports to fall by 20Mt in 2015.

Crude oil was higher, buoyed by the strong US confidence number. WTI found the bulk of support, rising
1%. Brent struggled to gain traction as hopes of OPEC supply cuts seemed to diminish. A Bloomberg
survey pointed to a gain in output to 30.94m barrels per day in September, driven by a recovery in Libya
exports.

Agriculture markets were stronger, led by grains. Wheat rose 1.1% as concerns that harvests in Australia
and Russia may be weaker than expected due to adverse weather. The dry conditions in Russia could in
fact cut its harvest to less than 50Mt in 2015. Soybeans were also higher (+0.3%) after forecasts of a
smaller-than-expected crop in South America brought out buyers.

***
OIL ... Nov contract rose $0.42 to $81.42 barrel, with a high of $81.66 and a low of $80.36 bsrrel. The
Dec contract gained $0.42 to $81.12 barrel with a high of $81.30 and low of $80.03 barrel. Brent Oct ICE
rose $0.10 to $85.93 barrel with a high of $86.38 and low of $85.08 barrel. Tapis price fell $0.54 to
