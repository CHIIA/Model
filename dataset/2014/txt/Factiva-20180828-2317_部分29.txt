WIND FARMS Chinese investors have a 75 per cent share in both the $90m Woolnorth wind farm
and $300m Musselroe wind farm in partnership with Hydro Tasmania. Shenhua Clean Energy
Holdings has had its stake in Musselroe since it began operating mid last year.
MINING Chinese companies have interests in five Tasmanian mines: Savage River, Avebury,
Rosebery, Renison and King Island Scheelite.

Magnetite producer Grange Resources, which operates Tasmania’s Savage River Mine, is about 60
per cent Chinese owned.
Mining company MNG, which operates the Rosebery and Mt Lyell copper mines, is based in Hong
Kong.
EDUCATION The University of Tasmania has more than 1000 Chinese students worth an estimated
$100 million to the Tasmanian economy.

MARINE Over the past 35 years Incat Tasmania has had extensive business dealings with the
Chinese, selling 25 vessels to Hong Kong. Each vessel is worth upwards of $40 million. Incat is
confident the relationship will continue.
TOURISM The $8 million Coal Valley Farm, a planned boutique paddock-to-plate farm experience
near Richmond, has a Chinese investor signed up to the joint venture. Work has began on the farm,
which will include a pick-your-own berry farm and orchard, a boutique vineyard, on-site artisan
production of chocolate, a cafe and farm shop.
HOSPITALITYThe Hope and Anchor hotel was bought by Chinese developer Kim Xing for $1.5
million late last year. It has been reopened and run by local operators on his behalf.
