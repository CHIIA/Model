Perth-based junior 3D Resources has walked away from 15 per cent of future profits from the
mothballed Southern Cross gold operations in exchange for $1 million from its Chinese owners.
Hong Kong-listed Hanking Gold Mining acquired the operations, which include the Marvel Loch
under- ground mine and a 2.4Mtpa processing plant, from St Barbara for $22.5m last year.

The Peter Mitchell-run 3D Resources brokered the deal.
At the time of acquisition, Hanking spruiked it would invest at least $50m in Marvel Loch in the
hope of eventually producing 200,000oz of gold a year. But the silence from Hanking has been
deafening since the US dollar gold price tumbled 25 per cent in a horror 2013.
Mr Mitchell told the Australian Securities Exchange “re-development of the Southern Cross gold
mine was not commercial at the current gold price and the company was better off terminating its
interest rather than waiting for the gold price to recover”.
Gold traded at $US1305.73/oz in Sydney at yesterday’s close.
The proceeds will fund upcoming drilling at 3D Resources’ recently- acquired Tatu coal project in
New Zealand.
