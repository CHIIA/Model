"Stabilise today, probably finish up 20/25 on the day, could be a little bit more"

"Maree" said, "I think we are going to stabilise today, probably finishing up 20/25 on the day, could be a
little bit more given it is the month's close off.

"But when the news hits again on deterioration in the emerging markets our market will be affected as well.

"I am not confident with what is going on with some of our sectors. The US economy continues to grow a
lot more than our economy.
"For us, its a matter of seeing what is going to happen with our No. 1 and No. 2 trading partners, China
and Japan. But for today, we are likely to close in the positive".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 40.9 points to 5188.1 last evening.

*India's central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, formerly chief economist at the IMF said in an interview
in Mumbai with Bloomberg TV India said that international monetary cooperation has broken down, noting
that emerging markets helped pull the global economy out of the crisis that began in late 2008, adding
industrial countries "can't at this point wash their hands off and say we'll do what we need to and you do
the adjustment.. we need better cooperation and unfortunately that's not been forthcoming so far".

In 2011 Rajan had co-authored a report that called for an International Monetary Policy Committee
composed of representatives from major central banks that would regularly report on the aggregate
consequences of individual central bank policies.

*ACR: 4th qtr sales of Axiron rise sharply
Eli Lilly last night reported 4th quarter sales of Axiron were $US53.9 million vs $US40.6 million in the
September quarter.

A leading Aussie broker commented, "We expect the share price to rally today and would be reducing
exposure above $2.70. Longer term we see head winds of increasing generic competition, potentially new

*CCL: CCL to now include major writedown of assets on Ardmona in result

Coca-Cola Amatil announced its disappointment in the Federal Government's decision not to invest $25
million as a one off grant for SPC Ardmona, the last remaining major fruit and vegetable processor in
Australia. The Federal Government decision also means a potential $25 million grant from the Victorian
that was conditional on a positive Fed decision will also no longer be forthcoming.
CCL had committed a further investment of more than $90 million to support the government contribution.
CCL Group MD Terry David said the government decision is disappointing in light of the fact that SPC
Ardmona had presented a solid business case to both the Fed and Victorian governments for a one off
co-investment of $25 million each with CCL committing to a significant and much greater investment of
more than $90 million. This was to be invested in best in class technology for both new product
development and efficiency gains, utilising clean, green Australian grown fruit and vegetables.

CCL will now need to write down its assets including brands and goodwill, to be included in CCL's 2013 full
year results presentation on February 18. (Jan 30, 5.10 pm)

*DJS/MYR: Received a proposal from Myer in Oct 2013 that was rejected

David Jones Ltd responding to various media commentary following a speculative article in "Street Talk" in
the Fin Review that Myer could approach David Jones in respect of a union by way of an all scrip deal at a
ratio of 1.4 Myer shares for every David Jones shares, David Jones is not currently in discussion with Myer
in relation to any such proposal.

David Jones was previously approached by Myer on October 28 2013 offering 1.06 shares in Myer for
each David Jones shares. The Board formed the view that the potential transaction did not have sufficient
merit for David Jones shareholders to warrant engaging in discussions.

Also the execution and implementation of any such transaction would have substantial commercial,
market, business and regulatory risks including the ACCC review process and would involve the diversion
of company resources over a lengthy period with great uncertainty as to the final outcome and the
potential to result in diminution of value of the David Jones business. (Jan 30, 8 pm)
