Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open lower with
our local futures contract down 48 points.

"It appears as though a retest of the December low is on the cards before another, perhaps final, rally high
is due.

"There was a big move north in the Japanese yen yesterday - I'll reiterate my warning from yesterday that
this is the canary in the coal mine.
"Bonds rallied again. It will be interesting to note the volume today on our market given that to date this
pullback does not look that sinister.

"The high will be 5265. The low will be 5232 . When the dust has settled the market will have closed at
5255, down 37.1 points.

*The OECD said its leading indicator continues to signal an improving economic outlook in most
advanced economies. The composite leading index rose to 100.9 in November from 100.7 in October.

Britain is leading a small band of advanced economies where growth is "firming" and the recovery gaining
traction, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD's
composite leading indicator (CLI) for the UK, which has a track record of predicting economic trends six
months in advance, continued to suggest growth was "firming", the Paris-based think-tank said on
Monday.

Growth in the US, Japan and Germany was also "firming" – though the rate of expansion was lower or
equal to the UK's – while France's economic recovery showed further signs of gaining traction and the
wider 18-member eurozone continued to show a "positive change in momentum".

Page22of276©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Emerging economies continued to lag behind, with the OECD reporting only a "tentative positive change
in momentum" in China, the world's second largest economy. Growth was "around trend" in Brazil and
Russia, and below trend in India.

*Spain's 4th quarter GDP rose 0.3%, following a 0.1% rise in the third quarter. While the economy is still
weak, it is recovering, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos announced on Monday in the Madrid
parliament.

The reduction in unemployment is coming faster than expected. De Guindos confirmed Spain will meet
the reduction of new borrowing for 2013 agreed with the EU Commission's deficit target of 6.5% of GDP.

*Speculation on ANZ bid for Standard Chartered does the rounds again

In the UK last night, Standard Chartered rose 0.4% to 12.92 pounds on further talk that it may be a target
for ANZ. Citigroup called the ANZ theory "possible but unlikely". Citigroup said ANZ still lacked scale in
Asian commercial banking but was now 50% bigger than StandardChartered thanks to the strength of its
domestic franchise.
*FMG/MIN: FMG buys out of 2 Christmas Creek ore processing facilities
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd has today assumed full ownership and operational responsibility for the two
Christmas Creek Ore Processing Facilities by purchasing the plants from Mineral Resources Ltd's
subsidiary Crushing Services International Pty Ltd (CSI) in accordance with the options granted by CSI
under the original Build Own Operate contracts.
The buyout of the finance lease for the two Christmas Creek Ore Processing Facilities continues FMG's
ongoing debt reduction program. (Jan 13)

*PPX/PXU: Coastal Capital applies to T/O Panel re. PPX bid for PXU

The Takeovers Panel has received an application from Coastal Capital International Ltd in relation to the
affairs of PaperlinX PS Trust which is the subject of a takeover bid by PaperlinX.

Coastal Capital has 19.16% of the SPS Trust for which PaperlinX has made an off market scrip bid,
offering 250 PPX shares for each SPS Trust unit. PPX intends to delist and cancel the SPSs and wind up
the SPS Trust.

Coastal Capital submits among other things that SPS holders may be coerced into accepting the bid
because of the risk that their rights will be substantially diminished by PPX crrying out its stated intentions,
and because there is an imbalance of rights between PPX and the SPS holders.

The various ocuments relating to the establishment and operation of the SPS Trust have not been
disclosed and the bid is properly characterised as a buy back ofPPX securities due to the links between
PPX and the SPS Trust which should be considered quasi securities of PPX, which constitutes a breach
of SPS terms.

Coastal Capital seeks final orders to prevent PPX exercising any rights in respect of SPSs it acquires
under its bid and that PPX be required to exchange the SPSs for preference shares in PaperlinX.

A sitting Panel has not been appointed at this stage and no decision has been made as to whether to
conduct proceedings. (Jan13)

weaker gold price, and create a solid foundation to build on once the gold price recovers. (Jan 13)
