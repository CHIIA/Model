Fonterra's chief financial officer Lukas Paravicini said the dairy giant is investing heavily to protect
itself from the market volatility that smashed the group's earnings in 2013-14, as it eyes growth
opportunities in China.
Fonterra, which is the world's biggest dairy exporter and the second-biggest processor in Australia,
reported record revenue of $NZ22.3 billion ($20.3 billion) in the year ended July 31 as dairy
commodity prices soared to record highs.

But net profit dived 79 per cent to $NZ179 million as the high cost of milk crimped margins for the
group's other products such as cheese and casein.

"We want to increase our flexibility so that we can produce what we want, when we want," Mr
Paravicini told The Australian Financial Review. "We are investing heavily to protect ourselves from
volatility but the next stage is to leverage the volatility."
The milk price that Fonterra is mandated to pay its farmers is calculated off commodities such as
milk powders. This means some products such as cheese saw a surge in input cost – milk – which
could not be recovered.
The co-operative paid its farmers a record milk price of $NZ8.40 per kilogram of milk solids in
2013-14 and the co-op's cost of goods sold rose 27 per cent to $NZ19.8 billion.

In light of the extreme market conditions the co-operative declared a dividend of $NZ10¢ a share,
two-thirds below last year. Fonterra said in August it is investing $NZ555 million to boost its
processing capacity and improve flexibility at its plants.

Mr Paravicini said he expected margins will start to improve in the second quarter of the current
year.

Alongside volatile markets, Fonterra has had to contend with the false health scare over a batch of
its whey protein concentrate (WPC80) which prompted widespread product recalls and shut
Fonterra out of some markets.
Fonterra's WPC is still banned in China. Despite the fallout, sales in China grew 6 per cent to
$NZ5.5 billion and demand in Sri Lanka is back to normal after Fonterra's products were locked
out during the health scare.

"For us WPC80 is a very significant event. We are focused to go on building trust and leading food
safety in the industry," Mr Paravicini said.

"We don't want to play the victim here. WPC80 is not an excuse for not delivering earnings. We
recognise that you can't just export product into a market, you have to embed yourself and be a
corporate citizen."

with Chinese infant nutrition company Beingmate was crucial to drive growth in the world's
second-biggest economy.
"You cannot do business in China without local partnerships and fresh local milk," he said.

Fonterra operates in 93 markets with more than 60 brands. Mr Spierings said the plan is to focus
primarily on eight core markets under five global brands: NZ Milk Products, Anchor, Anlene,
Anmum and a new brand to be unveiled next week.
Fonterra expects volatility to continue and it forecast a farmgate milk price of $NZ5.30 per kilogram
of milk solids and a dividend of NZ25¢ to NZ30¢ for 2014-15.
Earlier this year the Business Council of Australia issued a report highlighting Fonterra as an
example of successful government involvement to augment business competitiveness.
