MELBOURNE, May 7 (Reuters) - The former boss of Australia's Gloucester Coal has lined up $200
million from a private equity firm to buy metallurgical coal projects in Australia, New Zealand and
Indonesia, taking advantage of weak valuations in the sector.

The team at newly set up Pembroke Resources is looking to snap up small, potentially highly profitable
projects that are undeveloped, under construction or producing, at a time when small miners are unable
to raise capital on the market.

"It's my perfect scenario: where equity markets are in the doldrums and it's all over as far as they're
concerned, whereas in reality for metallurgical coal, I think the outlook is quite strong," Pembroke Chief
Executive Barry Tudor told Reuters.
Tudor and other former executives of Gloucester Coal, which was taken over two years ago by China's
Yanzhou Coal , set up Pembroke with backing from Denham Capital, which is making its first Australia
mining investment.
They are taking a contrarian view at a time when the price for metallurgical coal used in steel-making
has dropped to one-third the record high of around $300 a tonne hit in 2009, saying the price is still
healthy relative to its historical average.
The opportunity lies in snapping up coal resources with characteristics useful to particular steel mills
and which are too small to attract the majors, who are busy trying to slash costs following an expansion
binge when prices were high.
"There's still an evenly weighted demand and supply for coking coal and it's still very much in demand.
There isn't really an effective substitute," Tudor said.
Pembroke Resources is not interested in thermal coal used in power stations, even though there are
plenty of assets available, because thermal coal, in contrast with metallurgical coal, has to be
produced in big volumes to make money.
"You don't need to be a big player as far as volume goes in metallurgical coal to be a very, very
profitable producer," Tudor said.

His team has a shortlist of assets they are targeting but has not entered talks yet to acquire any. They
would be in a position to acquire an undeveloped asset within months, he said, adding that the
company will not need debt for any acquisitions. (Editing by Sunil Nair)
