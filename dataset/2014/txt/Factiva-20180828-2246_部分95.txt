KFC boosts Restaurant Brands Restaurant Brands lifted third-quarter sales 6.4 per cent as an increase in
revenue at its KFC stores offset falling sales at its Carl’s Jr burger chain. The Auckland-based company
lifted sales to $81.1 million in the 12 weeks to December 1 from $76.2 million a year earlier, it said.
Restaurant Brands expects full-year profit to exceed $22 million, higher than the company’s $20 million
forecast in April. and the $18.9 million posted last year. Meridian cancels Aussie plan Meridian Energy,
the partially privatised electricity generator and retailer, has abandoned plans for a 37mW hydro power
station at Burdekin Falls Dam, Queensland, blaming the “destabilising revisions” in the Australian Federal
Government’s renewable energy policy. The Government moved to reduce the country’s renewable
energy target, creating regulatory uncertainty around the project, Meridian said. Cost-cutting at Fronde IT
service provider Fronde has shed staff and cut costs after going into the red with a far lower than
expected first-half result due to decreased revenue from its Wellington consulting business. The
company reported a net loss of $1.3 million in the six months to September 30, from a profit of $700,000
a year earlier. That included a $187,000 unrealised, non-cash loss in foreign currency relating to its
Australian subsidiary. Blis fined $30,000 for rule breach Blis Technologies has been ordered to pay
$30,000 plus costs for breaching continuous disclosure rules when its CEO was caught on the fly in an
interview in August. The New Zealand markets disciplinary tribunal publicly censured the Dunedin firm
after Barry Richardson told a Fairfax Media publication its oral probiotics product would be distributed in
600 stores in China by pharmaceutical firm, Sinopharm, before informing the NZX. Watchdog stops
hospital takeover The Commerce Commission has turned down an application by the three biggest
shareholders of Acurity Healthcare Group to take the private hospital operator over, saying the group
would be the “only significant provider in the greater Wellington region” for some procedures. Connor
Healthcare wanted to buy the shares of Acurity it didn’t already own, which would have put three of the
region’s four private hospital under the group’s ownership, it said. Auction house businesses for
saleMowbray Collectables, the unprofitable listed auction house business, has put its stamp, coin and
bank note trading businesses up for sale to enhance shareholder value and reposition the company. The
company embarked on a review after its first-half loss increased to $1.99 million from $700,000 a year
earlier. Aotearoa Fisheries back in profit Aotearoa Fisheries, which manages more than $530 million of
fisheries assets for its iwi shareholders, returned to profit in the 2014 financial year after its major
investment, Sealord, exited its unprofitable South American business and returned a profit of $21.9
million, turning around a loss of $6 million a year earlier. Rakon sells UK plant Rakon has sold its
Lincoln, UK plant for £900,000 ($1.814 million), nearly all of which will go to repay debt, as part of a plan
to send more manufacturing work back to New Zealand. The high-tech components maker has been
exiting the smart wireless device market, which didn’t deliver big enough margins, to focus on the
burgeoning telecoms sector.
