Property: The highly active Mirvac Group has emerged as the keenest contender for the bulk of the
$350 million Altis Property Partners portfolio.
While the private equity real estate group is still deciding the composition of any sale, Mirvac’s ability
to manage industrial property and also develop residential sites is believed to have put it in pole
position.

Buyers from Hong Kong and Singapore — and many have strategies to get into the Australian
market — are more keen on passive assets and may instead chase a $150m-plus portfolio of Super
Retail Group-occupied assets.
The sale of the Altis Real Estate Equity Partners 1 portfolio — which spans 10 properties with the key
industrial asset being a $150m complex in Sydney’s St Leonards — is being handled by Colliers
International, with assistance from CBRE and Chesterton International on some assets.

Altis has proven a savvy asset trader as it bought early in the cycle and then worked to stabilise the
properties.

The parties and Colliers International were tight-lipped yesterday but if Mirvac goes through with the
purchase, which may not include some of the office assets in the portfolio, it will also have the
capacity to develop a major apartment complex in St Leonards.

UBS analysts noted that Mirvac historically outperforms the REIT market when the cash rate is falling
until the early stages of a tightening cycle due to its residential exposure.

They expect this trend to continue and tipped that now consensus earnings forecasts have been
rebased for this financial year, growth in coming years will accelerate.More apartments — including
the latest stage of Sydney’s Harold Park project which nearly sold out on the weekend — are
expected to settle and the earnings forecasts will rise if the group can quickly restock its development
pipeline.
