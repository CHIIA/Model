0746 GMT [Dow Jones] The Indian government has formed a panel of ministers and departments to fast
track investment proposals made by U.S. firms, according to a government statement. The panel will
identify and address bottlenecks faced by U.S. firms in the South Asian nation and will also encourage
investments in green, advanced and smart technologies, it says. The panel will include officials from all
major ministries including foreign affairs, trade, economic affairs, power, roads and railways, electronics
and telecommunications, among others. The U.S. is the second-biggest trading partner for India after
China, as per Indian government data. (krishna.jai@wsj.com; Twitter: @jaikrishna)

0728 GMT [Dow Jones]--Any change to the UK's financing requirement for the current fiscal year in
today's upcoming Autumn Statement could result in an immediate change in the gilt remit. However
analysts at Citi point out that any fiscal slippage this year is likely to be offset by an overfund from
previous years, leaving the remit broadly unchanged around the current level of GBP127.2bn. Add that
any material change to the funding need would probably be met by Treasury bill sales and not extra gilt
issuance. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0727 GMT [Dow Jones]--The Aussie dollar took a hit overnight after a big miss in Australia's 3Q GDP
(+0.3% vs +0.7% forecast). AUD/USD sank to a fresh 4-year low of 0.8390, with little sign of any bounce.
Elsewhere the greenback powered ahead as U.S. yields ticked higher, helped by a more upbeat
assessment of the economy from the New York Fed's Dudley. USD/JPY and the Nikkei printed 7-year
highs, while EUR/USD came within 10 ticks of a fresh 2-year low. Up ahead, November services PMIs,
Eurozone retail sales and the UK Chancellor's Autumn Statement grab attention. gary.stride@wsj.com

0716 GMT [Dow Jones] Investors are likely to closely watch data and events in the U.S. "If a slew of
economic data [in the U.S.] later this week shows a firm tone, the USD may try to reach 120," says FPG
Securities chief executive Koji Fukaya. In addition to the closely monitored jobs data for November,
investors are awaiting the private sector jobs report for November and the U.S. Federal Reserve Beige
Book, both scheduled for release later Wednesday. But should the dollar hit the 120 yen mark, the dollar
may quickly face profit-taking as investors move to lock in their gains ahead of the holiday season, says
Fukaya. The USD/JPY now at 119.25. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

be downwards in 2015. It says inflation will stay low; unemployment will rise; weaker commodity prices
will have slowed nominal GDP growth to "stall speed" through the first half of 2015; mining investment
has further to fall; house price growth will slow; the government's budget setting will stay tight. Goldman
Sachs says it now sees a cut in March 2015 and August, taking the cash rate to 2.0%.

0542 GMT [Dow Jones] Signs of a rebalancing of growth in Australia's economy are being overwhelmed
by drops in company and government investment, said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS. The
additional burden of sharply falling commodity prices is also undermining the economy's earnings.
Haslem adds that late 2015 may yet prove to be too early for the central bank to step away from the
current record low record low cash rate. "While we continue to see as low the likelihood they'll trim the
cash rate further, some stabilisation in the global economy and an ongoing fall in the Australian dollar is
now likely needed to sustain that view," Haslem said. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter

0535 GMT [Dow Jones] With Australia's terms of trade falling sharply, the risks are skewed to the
downside for the economy, says Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital Markets. If more
assistance is not delivered by a further fall in the value of the Australian dollar in the months ahead, there
is a high chance that the central bank will respond with another rate cut early next year, he says.

0532 GMT [Dow Jones] India's state-run telecommunications companyMahanagar Telephone Nigam
(500108.BY) plans to raise 37.69 billion rupees ($609 million) by issuing bonds, as it aims to repay
high interest loans. Earnings of MTNL, which operates in two of India's 22 telecom service areas, has
been hurt by high finance costs which makes up more than half of its revenue. During the
July-September quarter, the company said it posted a loss of 8.34 billion rupees on revenue of 8.51
billion rupees. Its finance costs for the quarter stood at 4.25 billion rupees. (krishna.jai@wsj.com;

0516 GMT [Dow Jones] Malaysia risks running the so-called twin-deficit, or a shortfall in both fiscal and
current accounts, by the first quarter of 2015 if exports remain weak, AllianceDBS says. "As the fiscal
deficit is not expected to return to a balance before 2020, the twin deficit situation, even temporarily, put
the country's sovereign credit rating at risk of a downgrade," AllianceDBS says. Malaysia expects fiscal
deficit at 3.0% of gross domestic product next year, down from estimated 3.5% of GDP this year. The
house trims Malaysia's 2015 economic growth forecast to 5.0% on expectation of softening consumption
and export growth; a worst-case scenario puts Malaysia's growth at 3%-4%, resulting in the government
missing its fiscal target and risking a rating downgrade. Alliance expects the USD/MYR to be within
3.30-3.35 for full-year 2015, though it could hit a high of 3.50 next year. (jason.ng@wsj.com; Twitter:

0511 GMT [Dow Jones] The NZD/USD has been dragged lower as the AUD/USD falls on
worse-than-expected third-quarter gross domestic product data, says Western Union Business Solutions
corporate dealing manager Chris Hunter. "Things are not looking so sharp for commodity currencies." He
adds that the NZD/USD had already been under pressure following further falls in the GlobalDairyTrade
auction. The pair is at 0.7789. Hunter puts support for the pair at 0.7710 with resistance at 0.7825.

0454 GMT [Dow Jones] While the USD/JPY continues to show its strength (now at 119.23 after hitting a
fresh 7-year high of 119.44), Daiwa Securities chief FX analyst Yuji Kameoka warns that lower crude oil
prices could end up weakening expectations for both U.S. interest rates and the USD going higher.
Some U.S. monetary policy officials have said lower oil prices bode well for U.S. consumption and
growth. But Kameoka warns that a sufficiently large falloff in energy-related shares could spark a retreat
in U.S. stocks, causing a negative wealth effect in the area of personal consumption. "If people become
aware that excessive dollar strength, combined with oil price weakness, could cut into economic growth
in addition to putting downward pressure on inflation, market expectations for an early rate hike will likely
recede," Kameoka says. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

0339 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's electronics production could fall more in December after some
orders ahead of the Christmas-New Year festive season provided a temporary spurt, DBS Bank says in a
note after Singapore released softer November PMI readings. Singapore's overall manufacturing
purchasing managers' index eases to 51.8 in November from 51.9 in October while electronics PMI falls
sharply to 50.6 in November from 52.5 in October, according to late night data from the Singapore
Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management. The earlier uptick in the electronics PMI was boosted
mainly by a surge in the finished goods index, DBS says. "Risk is that production in the electronics
cluster may ease further in December. It appears that manufacturers may be in for a quiet Christmas," it
says. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)
