MELBOURNE, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Yancoal Australia Ltd is looking to raise up to $2.3 billion through a
sale of notes to shareholders, with its parent, China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd, kicking in its full
78 percent share.

Most of the funds will be used to repay existing senior debt to Yanzhou, Yancoal said on Monday.
Yanzhou will also provide a further A$1.4 billion ($1.21 billion) to help fund the company's
loss-making coal operations and pay distributions on the notes, shoring up its Australian arm amid a
slump in coal prices to 5-1/2 year lows.

"In a depressed commodities marketplace facing continued uncertainty for the near-term, Yancoal's
existing level of debt is a significant constraint on our future expansion and operational improvement
strategies," Yancoal Chief Executive Reinhold Schmidt said in a statement.

The annual distribution rate on the notes will be set at 7 percent for the first five years.
