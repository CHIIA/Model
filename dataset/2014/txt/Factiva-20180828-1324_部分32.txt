SYDNEY -- Japanese trading houses Itochu Corp . and Sumitomo Corp . are seeking to sell a stake in
an Australian coal project, the latest example of overseas investors scaling back mining bets amid a
deep downturn in commodity prices, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.

Itochu and Sumitomo have hired advisers to sell a combined 45% interest in the Glencore PLC -run
NCA Project, which includes the Newlands and Collinsville mines in central Queensland state and
access to a berth at the Abbot Point coal port, the people said.

The Newlands and Collinsville mines can produce up to 17 million metric tons of thermal coal used in
power generation and coking coal for steelmaking a year. However, output has fallen below peak
levels as mine managers move to protect profits with prices of each commodity falling close to
multiyear lows.
J.P. Morgan is advising Itochu on the sale of its 35% stake, while Rothschild is seeking a buyer for
Sumitomo 's 10% interest, the people said. The Japanese firms are looking to close a deal before the
end of this year, they added.
Australia's vast reserves of coal and proximity to Asian countries such as China and Japan, the
world's two largest importers of the fuel, made it a favored destination for investors nervous about
security of supply. Itochu and Sumitomo nearly doubled their stake in NCA to 45% more than a
decade ago in a deal worth 550 million Australian dollars (US$516 million) that included interests in
several other mines.
However, prices of Australian thermal coal are hovering around US$70 a metric ton -- well down from
2008 highs of above US$190 -- and analysts say many mines in Queensland are losing money.
Thermal coal prices reflect slowing Chinese demand and oversupply in the Asian-Pacific market. Coal
cargoes are being rerouted from the U.S., where power plants and other consumers are switching to
less-expensive natural gas.
The downturn in prices has led many investors to scale back exposure to Australian coal either
through closing mines or selling assets. U.S.-based Peabody Energy Corp . sold its Wilkie Creek coal
mine in Queensland to one-time mining billionaire Nathan Tinkler . sold its Wilkie Creek coal mine in
Queensland to one-time mining billionaire
for US$70 million in May, having sought more than US$500 million for the asset when it was first put
up for sale in early 2012.
At Newlands, Glencore and its Japanese partners plan to stop underground mining next year, a move
that would reduce annual production by 2.5 million tons. To cut costs, Glencore last year also
scrapped a contract with a unit of Leighton Holdings Ltd ., which had been running the Collinsville mine
on its behalf. Still, Glencore and Sumitomo remain open to doing deals. The pair jointly purchased a
50.1% interest in the Clermont coal mine in Queensland from Rio Tinto PLC in October for A$1.05
billion.

tax on excessive profits from coal mining.
