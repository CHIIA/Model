The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close slightly higher today.

Europe and the UK closed higher, the US markets rose.

On the NYSE where 3192 issues traded there were 2,050 issues higher, 1,069 down and 82 unchanged.
On Nasdaq where 2690 issues traded there were 1,815 issues higher, 785 down and 90 unchanged.
Metals were mixed, crude rose, gold was down. The $A is at 89.18US c, more or less in line with last
evening.

"Support at 5315, resistance 5325 next at 5345, up 15 on the day"

Ben Faulkner, a senior adviser at Morgans said, "The S&P500 is still in uptrend. Resistance now is at the
1840 mark and then the previous high which was 1850. It could test the previous high, however it is likely
to consolidate into the reporting season.

"The German Dax has quite a similar chart to the S&P500. There was a bit of profit taking last week, but it
is regaining its losses and is likely to re-test the highs. The European markets are looking firmly in tact.

"In Japan, the market is still in uptrend although they have had a couple of days of sell off. However it is
currently testing the 20 day moving average which has been good support, at 15,756 - worth keeping an
eye on 15,756- if that breaks it will be short term bearish for Japan.
"With regard to gold. $1250 is resistance - it had the first negative night last night. It is still a bit of a dead
cat bounce. Last night could be the first move down. Support is at $1218. A break of $1218 could see it
test $1200 again.

"To our market, we had another weak performance yesterday, closing on the lows. The chart after
recovering December losses looks like it is trending down. The RSI also indicates that.

"I expect support at yesterday's low of 5315. Resistance now should be 5325, next at 5340. Underlying
weakness in our market continues compared to the global market. Resources are likely to remain weak,
household names and leaders probably will provide support.

"For the day I will call us up 15 points".

The S&P/ASX200 closed down 7.9 points to 5317 last evening.

January 8. Good morning.

*BBC News reports the International Monetary Fund will raise its forecast for global growth according to its
managing director, Christine Lagarde.

Page250of276©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.She said the revision would come in the next three weeks but did not elaborate, saying that it would be
premature to say any more.

In October the IMF lowered its growth forecasts, saying the global economy "remains in low gear".

It cut its growth forecast for 2014 by 0.2 of a percentage point to 3.6%.

It also reduced the estimate for 2013 growth by 0.3 of a point to 2.9%.
Back then it warned that a slower pace of expansion in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and
India, was holding back global expansion.

Trading points:

*OGC: OceanaGold Corporation announced the boad of directors has approved a new mine schedule for
the Macraes Goldfield located in the Otago region on the South Island of New Zealand. As a result of the
prolonged and sustained drop in the gold price, the company has re optimised the Macraes mine plan to
further reduce costs in order to sustain operations. The new mine plan includes a reduction in the total
material movement scheduled in the open pit, resulting in lower equipment usage and a reduction in
operating and support staff requirements over the next two years.

Managing director and CEO Mick Wikes said in the report, "The Macraes Goldfield has been operating
continuously for over 23 years, producing over 3.8 million ozs ofg old. During its life, Macraes has been a
major employer and contributor to the Otago region and local economy. He said the lower gold price has
necessitated the need to make changes to the business to ensure a sustainable operation at Macraes
which will also unfortunately have an impact on some of the workforce and contractors whose contribution
he acknowledged and thanked them for.

Full year 2014 production guidance
In 2014 the company plans to produce 275,000/305,000 ozs of gold at cash costs of $US400/450 and
all-in sustaining costs of $US750/850 per oz net of by product credits. Copper production from Didipio is
expected to be between 21,000 to 24,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate.
The company has also entered into additional hedging with a zero cost collar for production over the next
two years at Macraes, the impact of which being that if the spot gold price on maturity of the option is less
than $NZ1,500 per oz, the company will receive $NZ1,500 per oz. The Reefton production was similarly
hedged with a zero cost collar announced on June 27 2013.

Changes in substantials reported January 6 and 7 inc posted separately.

In US eco news, the US trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level in four years in November, as rising sales
of oil pushed US exports to a record high.

since October 2009, the US Commerce Department said.
Imports fell 1.4% from October as a fall in demand for foreign oil offset a record level of imported cars.

Exports rose 0.9%, boosted by a 5.6% rise in petroleum exports.

US exports were also boosted by stronger sales of American-made planes and machinery.

been falling. It averaged $94.69 a barrel in November.
