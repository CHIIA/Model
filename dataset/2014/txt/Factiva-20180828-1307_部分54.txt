AUSTRALIA’S Roc Oil has backed a new $474 million takeover offer from Chinese heavyweight
Fosun Group.
Roc’s recommendation that shareholders accept the offer sidelines its proposed $800 million merger
with fellow oil and gas company Horizon Oil.

Horizon’s shareholders were due to have voted on that deal by Thursday, although it was known that
Roc was being targeted by Fosun in July.

Shares in Roc soared by more than 6 per cent after details of Fosun’s bid emerged yesterday.
Among Roc’s assets are two producing oilfields in China.
Fosun is part of a private conglomerate controlled by billionaire Guo Guangchang.

Fosun’s 69¢-a-share offer is a 10 per cent premium to Roc’s closing share price last Friday of 63¢.

Roc’s share price has jumped 48 per cent since the merger with Horizon was announced in April.

Roc said in a statement that its board had deemed Fosun’s offer more favourable, given the significant
premium to share price performance.
“The proposal to purchase all of Roc’s shares for cash is superior when considered against the
alternative merger of equals with Horizon and offers a significant premium to share price
performance,” Roc chairman Mike Harding said.Fosun’s takeover is dependent on more than half of
Roc’s shareholders accepting its offer.
