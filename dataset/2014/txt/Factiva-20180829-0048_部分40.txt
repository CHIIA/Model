NEWS OF THE DAY

for the first time no sector showed an improvement in investment vs the previous quarter. Transportation,

Tobacco consumption in Australia falls significantly - ABS, Treasury statistics

"The Age" reports added to the Health Department's website quietly last week amid debate over the
effectiveness of plain packaging, the Treasury data shows 3.4 per cent fewer cigarettes were sold last
year than 2012. Plain packaging became mandatory on December 1, 2012.

The Treasury data is consistent with national accounts data that shows a decline of 0.9 per cent in the
amount of tobacco and cigarettes sold between 2012 and last year. The national accounts show a further
fall of 7.6 per cent in the three months to March after the first of a number of big increases in tobacco
excise announced late last year.

The Bureau of Statistics bases the national accounts measure on a survey of households, whereas the
Treasury collects information on every stick and pouch of tobacco sold.
The Treasury data suggests that, adjusted for population growth of 1.7 per cent, the number of sticks sold
per person slid about 5 per cent between 2012 and last year.

The ABS data has consumption of tobacco the lowest ever recorded. Both measures conflict with industry
claims that tobacco sales climbed by 59 million sticks or roll-your-own equivalents last year.
The claimed 0.3 per cent increase is said to be sourced from data analysis firm InfoView, although the
data behind it has not been released.

Changes in substantials reported June 18, 19 and 20 inc.

consumer and excessive fuel discounting by the two large grocery chains impacted.

*On June 18 a leading broker retained a "lighten" on Metcash with a $2.54 price target. The broker said it
expects underlying eps to decline 14.2% in line with company guidance, and revenue and EBITA in the
core Food & Grocery division to fall by 0.7% and 22.5% respectively. An update on the transformation plan
announced in March will be of interest.

*On June 17 a leading broker retained a "neutral" on Metcash with a $2.75 price target. The broker said
there is no doubt MTS model is under pressure. "We expect pressure to intensify with Aldi's push into new
markets (W/SA and Coles/WOW/s investment in loyalty and new stores (2/3% space growth pa)
marginalising MTS' historical competitive advantage (convenience). With the above in mind,
management's ability to demonstrate signs of stabilisation will be key - otherwise we see downside risk to
the share price".
Company guidance: On March 20 Metcash Ltd announced in an update to its 2014 full year guidance,
details of its strategic review to address structural challenges within the business will be presented to the
market on March 21.

Aspects of this plan are being implemented and have begun to impact current year's earnings. January
and February results were also below management forecasts. Management now expects a decline in
underlying eps in the range of 13/15% for 2014.

Metcash CEO Ian Morrice said the reason for this update to guidance is entirely due to the Food &
Grocery pillar.

Retail sales for independent retailers have lifted since the run in to Christmas , with the drivers for these
retail sales primarily been in fresh departments and direct sales and items not stocked in the group's
warehouses.

The carrying value of certain retail and other assets are being impaired, together expected to total $30/35
million pre tax, predominantly non cash in nature.
