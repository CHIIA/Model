NSW Office sale, 7-9 Merriwa Street, Gordon A syndicate of Chinese investors controlled by the
Sydney-based Chan and Chen families has purchased a commercial building with residential
development potential on Sydney’s north shore for $11.2 million. The six-level building, which was sold
under the hammer yesterday, is about 800m from Gordon train station. The site is zoned for a
mixed-use development, although there is still about five years remaining on some of the office leases.
Knight Frank senior director of Asian markets and commercial sales, Dominic Ong, said there was a lot
of competition for the property. “Asian investors are willing to take a long-term investment view,
especially for property with residential development potential,” Mr Ong said.
PRICE: $11.2m BUYER: Chinese syndicate AREA: 3600sq m (building), 2786sq m (site) AGENTS:
Dominic Ong and Brett Burridge, Knight Frank

VICTORIA Office sale, 2 Kingston Town Close, Oakleigh A private investor has purchased a freehold
office in Melbourne’s southeast for $1.6m. The property is leased by science company Eurofins.
Colliers International agent Hamish Burgess said the property attracted strong competition. “Given the
sustained low interest rate environment, investors are chasing high-yielding commercial property and,
in turn, driving yields down,” Mr Burgess said.

PRICE: $1.6m YIELD: 7.9 per cent BUYER: Private investor SELLER: Private investor AREA: 1698sq
