Two Chinese companies have announced major Australian acquisitions on Friday. China
Communications Construction International (CCCI) is buying construction company John Holland for
A$1.15 billion ($951 million), and ID Leisure International Capital has acquired cinema chain The Hoyts
Group for A$900 million ($743 million).
subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which is the world's fourth largest
construction firm by revenue, reports BBC News. John Holland, which is a unit of Australia's Leighton
Holdings, built Australia's parliament building, and reported annual revenue of A$4.5 billion in 2013. About
4,100 of the unit's 5,000 workers will transfer to the new business, Leighton Holdings said in a statement
Friday.

Meanwhile, China's ID Leisure International Capital has signed a deal to acquire Australia's second
largest cinema chain The Hoyts Group from buyout firmPacific Equity Partners for approximately A$900
million ($743 million), reports Reuters. ID Leisure is an investment vehicle owned by Chinese real estate
billionaire Sun Xishuang.
Pacific Equity, Australia's largest private equity firm, originally planned to publicly float Hoyts early next
year, but instead decoded to sell to ID Leisure. According to Reuters, opting for private sale over a public
one indicates companies are not so hot on the Austrlian IPO market.
Xishuang is a major shareholder of China's Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co Ltd, which
acquired U.S.-based AMC Theatres for $2.6 billion two years ago.
Pacific Equity has hired investment bank UBS to help close the sale of the cinema chain. The buyout
group bought Hoyts from a consortium involving Australian casino billionaire James Packer for A$440
million in 2007.All Rights Reversed for Saudi Press Agency Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
