THE uncapped volume on dairy products into China will help the industry compete against New
Zealand, according to the national lobby group.
Australian Dairy Farmers president Noel Campbell said tariffs on New Zealand dairy product into
China would run out in 2018, before some major Australian dairy products lose tariffs, but this didn’t
necessarily put Australia at a disadvantage.

“New Zealand has a small quota on UHT, less than two million litres a year,” he said.
“A big part is we can put UHT in (to China) easier although we have tariffs. “WMP (whole milk
powder) is the only one with a safeguard on it. It is a product New Zealand excels at — they can
produce it a lot cheaper than us.” The WMP safeguard, or volume cap, is 17,500 tonnes for the first
year and will increase by 5 per cent a year.

Mr Campbell said he didn’t know why under the trade agreement some products, such as ice cream,
lactose and casein had tariffs reduced within four years and other products had a longer phase-out
time.
According to Dairy Australia, ice cream exports to China were worth $2.1 million this year — a drop
of 28 per cent from last year.
Lactose was worth $6.6 million this year, a decrease of 40 per cent from 2013, while Australia sold
$25 million of infant formula to China this year and $38 million in 2013.
In volume terms it was the eighth largest dairy export to China in 2014 and the sixth largest in value.
WMP exports to China was worth almost $139 million this year, a 97 per cent lift in value from the
previous year.
The 10-15 per cent tariff on cheese, butter and yoghurt will be eliminated in nine years and the 15 per
cent tariff on liquid milk will also be finished in nine years.
Cheese was the third largest Chinese export earner for Australia this year at $82 million with milk
worth $39 million.
Mr Campbell said he expected China to push for “quite significant quotas” — similar to its agreement
with New Zealand — but this wasn’t the case.
He thought China felt “over exposed to New Zealand” when it came to dairy products.
Describing the deal as “excellent”, he said it was a medium to long-term deal where dairy farmers
would see the benefits in their milk cheque in a couple of years.

is a market for it. Look at Japan, Japan is a mature market … this market is growing.” Milk processors
applauded the deal.Fonterra labelled it a “game changer” while Murray Goulburn said it “seemed to
tick all the boxes”.
