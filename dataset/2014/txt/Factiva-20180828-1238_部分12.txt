Australia's Western Areas has received expressions of interest from 25 parties from China, Europe, the
US and Canada to buy the nickel concentrate it recently offered through tender and expects to finalize
an offtake deal by the fourth quarter, the company's Managing Director Dan Lougher said in a
conference call announcing its full-year financial results Monday.
Its current offtake deal for 26,000 mt over a two-year period with China's Jinchuan Group expires this
December.

Lougher said the company was seeing very strong demand from traders in China and well-established
traders in Europe who are very active currently to secure positions.
"We're also seeing interest from new European mining companies who have mines, smelters and are
trying to secure resources," he said.
Interest also came from nickel pig iron producers in Finland, Canada and the US wanting to use the
nickel concentrate to test roasting technologies, he added.

Meanwhile, Lougher said he expects the nickel market to remain strong, with prices likely to rise to as
high as $9.50/lb by the middle of next year, mainly on the back of Indonesia's ban on nickel laterite ore
exports.

However, he warned that if prices hit $13-14/lb, then substitutions would have to enter the market.
Nickel prices averaged around $6.32/lb over July-December, but had risen to average $7.50/lb over
January-June after Indonesia banned ore exports in January, he said.

Stainless steel demand to lend support

Other than Indonesia, Western Areas also cited fears of a global supply deficit in 2015, higher cost and
capacity of Chinese nickel pig iron production and rising stainless steel demand as factors supporting
nickel prices.

Lougher expects global stainless steel demand to rise by around 6-7% in fiscal year 2015 ending June
30, 2015, saying the fundamentals are also there for further growth.

Western Areas also has an offtake agreement selling 12,000 mt/year of nickel in concentrate to BHP
Billiton's Nickel West Kambalda operations in Western Australia until 2017.

Last week, BHP said it would continue to try and sell its Nickel West mine and smelter, as the operation
was not a good fit for either BHP or its proposed new company currently known as NewCo.
"Anything that happens with BHP strengthens us, as we're not impacted by the sale or closure of
Nickel West," Western Area's executive director David Southam said in the conference call.

The company's nickel in concentrate output reached 25,700 mt in fiscal 2014, down from 26,918 mt in
the year-ago period.
The company expects to produce 24,500-25,000 mt of nickel in concentrate during fiscal 2015 at cash
costs of A$2.70-2.80/lb ($2.51-2.61/lb), from A$2.50/lb in fiscal 2014, it said.
Western Areas posted a net profit after tax for the full year ended June 30, 2014 of A$25.5 million,
compared with a loss of A$94.1 million in the year-ago period.
