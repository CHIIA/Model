Wilmar International Ltd and Salim Group, through First Pacific, have decided to buy Australia's largest
bread-maker, Goodman Fielder Ltd., with a total investment of US$1.37 billion. John Ryan, First Pacific s
executive vice president group corporate communications, commented that the two sides were attending
due diligence. "The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015," Ryan
commented. Wilmar already has 10 percent shares in Goodman Fielder. Moreover, Wilmar will increase
its shares in the New South Wales-based firm. After the acquisition, First Pacific and Wilmar will each
own 50 percent of it. He added "It is a good company, but it is experiencing tough times and we see it as
an opportunity." He also believes that Wilmar and First Pacific would boost further as they had powerful
networks in Indonesia as well as China.
