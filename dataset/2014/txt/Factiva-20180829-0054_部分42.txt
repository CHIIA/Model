WELLARD is moving quickly to grab a foothold in the burgeoning Chinese protein market with two
major trade deals.
The company has sent a commercial consignment of high quality Dorper breeding stock to China
and its Beaufort River Meats (BRM) abattoir has gained accreditation to export lamb and mutton to
China.

Building on the company's significant presence in China as an exporter of high performance dairy
heifers from Australia and New Zealand, Wellard has just completed the airfreight of more than 1200
Dorper rams and ewes and has also shipped its first container of mutton to China.

The sheep were sourced from Victoria, South Australia and WA for a client in Inner Mongolia.

A 100 per cent success rate was achieved on the 12-hour Singapore Airlines flight from Perth to
Hohhot, Inner Mongolia (including a refuelling stopover).
The sheep are currently undertaking a 45-day quarantine period in China before moving onto their
new host property to form the nucleus of a breeding flock.

They were quarantined in Australia for 30 days prior to departure.
Wellard general manager Harold Sealy said the sheep were purchased by large, privately-owned
farming organisation which supports many of the smaller farmers in the state of Inner Mongolia.

"Wellard expects to develop this market further as there appears to be strong demand for high quality
sheep genetics from China, and Australia is perfectly placed to supply those genetics," Mr Sealy said.
Wellard managing director Mauro Balzarini said the Dorper sheep exports and BRM China
accreditation expanded Wellard's supply portfolio of protein and genetics to China.
"Wellard has more than 25,000 dairy and beef breeding cattle already booked for supply to China
from Australia and New Zealand before end of the year, and we are currently developing specific
assets in China and in Australia with the expectation that feeder and slaughter cattle exports to China
will commence in the short term," Mr Balzarini said.

"Wellard is very well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for beef, sheepmeat, beef
cattle, dairy cattle and sheep genetics in China."
