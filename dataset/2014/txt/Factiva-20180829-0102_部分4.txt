Foreign equities

Keppel Corp Ltd

Target price: S$13.35 BUY

CITI RESEARCH (APRIL 28): Our target price is based on a marginal discount to our RNAV estimate of
S$13.47 per share and applying a 20% discount to the value of Keppel’s investments in M1 and K1
ventures, Dyna-Mac and K-Green Trust as we see Keppel as a passive investor in most of these
ventures.
For the group’s offshore and marine (O&M) business, we use 17 times average FY14 to FY16 PER,
close to +1 standard deviation of SMM’s historical mean (since 2001) to account for stronger execution
and order win prospects. For infrastructure, we use a slightly below peer average FY14 PER of seven
times to reflect modest growth expectations and our conservative stance. We value the group’s 55%
stake in Keppel Land based on Citi’s target price.
Key downside risks to our investment thesis on the group are: 1) sharp decline in oil prices or severe
credit tightening, which could affect demand for offshore drilling equipment and earnings at the O&M unit;
2) an economic slowdown, any government policy changes or sharp interest rate increases in Singapore
or China, which could affect Keppel’s property business in these countries; 3) slippages in offshore or
infrastructure contracts under execution, which could lead to penalties/losses; and 4) overpaying for
acquisitions.

Ho Bee Land Ltd

Target price: S$2.51 ACCUMULATE

PHILLIP CAPITAL (APRIL 30): Revenue and profit after tax and minority interest in 1Q14 have
underperformed our expectations, meeting only 14% and 6% of our FY14 estimates respectively. The
rental income from The Metropolis had yet to come in fully as some of the tenants will only be moving into
the premises later this year. The situation should improve in coming quarters as The Metropolis is
currently 94% leased and contribution will also come from the new London office acquisition, 1 St Martin
Le Grand.
We believe the sentiment for high-end residential sales will remain sluggish and there will be no
significant residential sales contribution for Ho Bee this year. We expect the company to launch its
China and Australia residential projects (Pearl, Melbourne and Rhapsody, Gold Coast) this year, and
development income from these projects to contribute significantly to Ho Bee’s earnings in FY15/16.

Ho Bee is expected to explore investment opportunities overseas (Australia and London) in the near term
to grow its property development and investment business.

As the expected occupancy rate for The Metropolis this year is lower than previously assumed, we revise
the revenue and net profit downwards by 15% and 24% respectively. We maintain our “accumulate”
rating, with a target price of $2.51, pegged to 35% discount to RNAV.

Target price: IDR5,600 BUY

RHB RESEARCH (APRIL 29): Bank Negara Indonesia posted net earnings of IDR2.39 trillion in 1Q14,
representing 25% of our and consensus’ full-year estimates. Net interest income was within expectations,
with net interest margin relatively flat (+5 basis points) on a q-o-q basis. Lower operating cost drove its
cost-to-income ratio down to 45% (FY13: 51%), but this was offset by a sharp increase in provision to
IDR1.23 trillion, which we believe was precautionary.

Credit cost had been the highest in a quarter since 2Q10, but management maintains its full-year outlook
of below IDR3 trillion. Consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio hit 90% as loans growth (23% y-o-y) continued
to outpace deposits growth (13% y-o-y). Corporate loans (45% of total loans) led with 32% y-o-y loan
expansion, followed by medium loans. Consumer loans growth slowed to 12% y-o-y. Current and savings
deposits have grown at the slowest annual pace (10% y-o-y) since 2Q11 while time deposit (TD) growth
rose to 18% y-o-y, the fastest pace since 4Q09. This could spur the bank to be more aggressive in TD
pricing in the near future.

Pre-non-performing loans (NPLs) rose 16% q-o-q (-12% y-o-y) while gross NPL ratio inched up slightly to
2.3% (4Q13: 2.2%) on small NPLs. Provisioning should improve as restructuring and sales of NPLs are
underway, and written-off asset recovery (IDR445 billion in 1Q14) should pick up in 9M14.
China LESSO Group Holdings Ltd
Target price: HK$7.20 BUY

KIM ENG SECURITIES (APRIL 29): Trading at 40% discount to A-share listed peers and being a
constituent of the Hang Seng Composite MidCap Index, we expect the discount to narrow under the
upcoming “through train” scheme. We foresee higher demand for plastic pipes, driven by increasing
urbanisation, government-led municipal pipeline construction and water conservation projects. We
believe China LESSO can grow its home building material sales by leveraging its market leadership in
plastic pipes. We also expect its margins to improve.
Controlling shareholder and founder Wong Luen Hei recently raised his stake in the company, reflecting
his strong confidence in its prospects amid favourable policies, in our view. Our latest meeting with
management assures us of our bullish earnings forecast, as supported by its on-schedule capacity
expansion progress in Yunnan and Hainan, an improving utilisation rate, more new customers and
deeper sales penetration.
We anticipate the company’s free cash flow position will improve and therefore support a dividend yield
of 4% to 5%. We forecast the company will be net cash position in FY16F. China LESSO trades at 6.4
times FY14 PER, compared with 10.8 times for A-share listed plastic pipe manufacturing peers and 8
times for HK-listed construction material producers. Key risks are weaker-than-expected construction
activity, a surge in raw material cost, threat of substitutes such as stainless steel pipes, and margin
dilution from its home building material business.
Sands China Ltd
Target price: HK$82 BUY
CITI RESEARCH (APRIL 29): Our target price is derived by assigning equal weights to the equity values
derived from our SOP and discounted cash flow (DCF)-based valuation methodologies. Our SOP
valuation yields an equity value of HK$78.52 per share. We value the group’s casinos in Cotai at 16
times 2015 EV/Ebitda and Sands Macao at 14 times 2015 EV/Ebitda. We value The Parisian at a lower
12 times 2017 EV/Ebitda as we expect the property to deliver first full-year of operations in 2017.
We value the Four Seasons Serviced Apartment at US$1 billion. We believe it is prudent not to factor in
the group’s potential development project of Phase 3 of Cotai Central and potential sales of the group’s
shopping mall, given the uncertainty as to whether the sales will materialise.
Our DCF-based valuation produces an equity value of HK$85.94. Our assumed weighted average cost
of capital of 9% is derived from a cost of equity of 10% and an after-tax cost of debt of 2.2%; we use a 14
times multiple to estimate the terminal value. Key downside risks to our investment thesis on the
company are: 1) slowdown in the China economy; 2) unfavourable changes in visa policies in China;
and 3) delay in The Parisian construction.

PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk

Page11of296©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Fair value: IDR2,650 Buy

INDO PREMIER (APRIL 29): Telkom Indonesia posted a net profit of IDR3.7 trillion in 1Q14, representing
23% of our FY14 forecast and 24% of consensus estimates. Quarterly net income growth was driven by
lower salary, operational and maintenance costs as well as a one-time write-off in 4Q13. We expect costs
to go up in the coming quarters. We also expect full-year Ebitda margin to drop to 50.7% versus 51.7% in
1Q14. Total revenue was IDR21.3 trillion in 1Q14 with strong data growth (IDR5.2 trillion), relatively
stable voice (IDR10.3 trillion) and SMS (IDR3.2 trillion). Contribution from data increased to 28% of
revenue in 1Q14 versus 25% in FY13. Total subscribers stood at 132 million as at March 31, 2014.

During 1Q14, consolidated cash spend reached IDR5.1 trillion, representing 26% of our expected capital
expenditure for FY14.
Telkom’s capex of IDR900 billion was used to deploy access and backbone infrastructure to support
broadband service. Telkomsel’s capex of IDR2.5 trillion was used to develop radio access network. Still,
Telkom remains cash positive with balance of IDR20.7 trillion as at March 31, 2014.

Blended average revenue per user in 1Q14 was IDR37,000, up 2.7% y-o-y but down 5.3% q-o-q. ARPU
was lower q-o-q due to seasonality, as usage tends to be higher in 4Q (holiday season). Industry
consolidation has also helped reduce price competition, leading to a relatively stable ARPU.
Lenovo Group Ltd
Target price: HK$11.40 BUY

SUN HUNG KAI FINANCIAL (APRIL29): We are revising our estimates for 2014 downwards slightly and
reducing our pro forma FY15 and FY16 EPS by 5% to 8.7 US cents and 12.6 US cents respectively.
Management is guiding for a four to six-quarter turnaround schedule for Motorola; we have reduced our
expectation from three quarters to five. We maintain our “buy” rating and reduce our target price to
HK$11.40 on FY15 PER of 17 times and FY16 PER of 11.7 times.

Key risks are: (1) increased competition in PC and mobile hardware, eroding gross margins; (2) inability
to control rising operating cost to support growth; (3) unable to deliver innovative mobile products at the
right price to consumer markets; and (4) unable to realise synergies from IBM x86 and Motorola Mobility
acquisitions.
Our investment thesis is based on company-specific opportunities that will allow it to grow revenue at a
25% CAGR for FY14E/16E, driven by: 1) sales of tablets, smartphones and servers; 2) continued PC
penetration in emerging markets and market-share gains in developed markets; and 3) growth from the
recent IBM and Motorola acquisitions.
We estimate the company will achieve an EPS CAGR of 25% over the same period, benefiting from
margin expansion of 40 basis points.
China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec)

Target price: HK$8 OVERWEIGHT
JP MORGAN (APRIL 28): We forecast Sinopec’s upstream operating profit at RMB13.2 billion, up 64%
q-o-q but down 20% y-o-y, on lower oil prices. We forecast oil and gas production to go up 5% y-o-y. We
expect the refining segment’s operating profit to be at RMB3 billion, up 55% q-o-q and 37% y-o-y,
reflecting the positive impact of fuel specification reform partly offset by lower demand for oil products.
We expect refining margins to be at US$1 per barrel (ex-inventory impacts), similar to that in 4Q13, and a
gradual improvement in 2Q with maintenance tightening oil product supply.
We see the marketing segment’s operating profit at RMB9.1 billion, slightly higher than the previous
quarter. Investor focus is likely to be on the timing for retail reform, with potential investors being invited to
take part in the retail segment. We expect the chemicals segment to report an operating loss of RMB1.4
billion due to lower margins from oversupply, particularly commodity chemicals (PE/PX/BD).

The chemical business remains challenging, with increased competition (the Middle East and the US),
although demand seems to be robust. As SPC highlighted, Sinopec may report higher negative net
financing charges from foreign exchange impact as well as some impact from the company’s A-share
convertible bond.
