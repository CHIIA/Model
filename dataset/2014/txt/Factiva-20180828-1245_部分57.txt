0738 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian shares rose to a two-week high amid growing optimism about the
current earnings period in Australia and some signs that offshore markets were becoming resilient to
ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Wesfarmers (WES.AU), Woolworths (WOW.AU), Woodside (WPL.AU),
AMP (AMP.AU) and Brambles (BXB.AU) rose 0.6%-1.9% before their respective earnings reports this
week, while Telstra (TLS.AU), CSL (CSL.AU), Suncorp (SUN.AU), Transurban (TCL.AU) and Crown
(CWN.AU) gained 0.5%-1.4% after reporting last week. Carnarvon Petroleum (CVN.AU) nearly tripled
after U.S. energy companyApache Corp. said an exploration well offshore Western Australia state had
found as much as 300 million barrels of crude. Carnarvon owns a 20% stake in the project. National
Australia Bank fell 1.4% after third-quarter revenue fell and provisions for U.K. consumer claims
increased. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.4% at 5587.1, its highest point since August 1.
Share trading value was lower than average. (david.rogers@wsj.com; Twitter: @DavidRogersWSJ)

0734 GMT [Dow Jones] IDFC Securities keeps outperformer rating on Adani Power (533096.BY) with
INR69 target price. It says last week's deal to buy power plant from Lanco Infratech (532778.BY) for
about $1 billion in Udupi, Karnataka state, gives Adani an operational 1,200 MW coal-based facility.
Capacity of power plant can be increased by additional 1,320 MW. "As a result, we believe the
acquisition is value-accretive for Adani Power in the long term," says IDFC. Adani now +1.2% at
INR54.20. (santanu.choudhury@wsj.com)

0733 GMT [Dow Jones]--Gilts open the week in negative territory after BOE governor Carney, in an
interview with the Sunday Times, said interest rates could increase before wages rise. Ahead this week,
July inflation and retail sales data Tuesday, and the BOE minutes Wednesday, may shed some more
light on the situation. The September contract opens 25 ticks lower at 113.04, the 2-year yields 0.69%
and the 10-year 2.39%, both 3bps higher from Friday's close. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0733 GMT [Dow Jones]--Despite stability in emerging market currencies in general, the Turkish lira
weakened against the dollar after Moody's comments and on worries that economy team may change in
the new cabinet, which will be announced on Aug. 27, says Turk Ekonomi Bankasi. It says that if the
central bank doesn't tighten liquidity significantly, it will limit room for lira appreciation. USD/TRY is now at
2.1684. (yeliz.candemir@wsj.com)

0731 GMT [Dow Jones] Fitch's Friday upgrade of Ireland feels a bit of a "catch up play" with Standard &
Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, says Deutsche Bank. Fitch Ratings upgraded Ireland to 'A-' with a

0727 GMT [Dow Jones] Hong Kong's unexpected GDP contraction in the second quarter means the
city's economic recovery is going to take longer than thought, says Standard Chartered, downgrading its
growth forecasts to 2.5% this year from 3.5%, and to 3.5% for 2015 from 4.5%. "We still expect Hong
Kong to do better in H2-2014 than in H1, driven by China's stabilizing economy, a further recovery in
exports to the West, favorable capital flows, and the recent revival in local residential property," the
bank says. "China's slowdown has hurt investment sentiment, while mainland tourist arrivals have
moderated and these visitors are shifting their spending away from high-value items." Inflation will
outstrip growth, with CPI expected at 3.5% this year and 4% in 2015, the bank adds. The city reported its
first quarterly contraction since 2011 on Friday, with Q2 GDP falling 0.1% quarter-over-quarter.

0715 GMT [Dow Jones]--The upgrade of Ireland's rating by Fitch Ratings on Friday to 'A-' from 'BBB+'
stores some good news for the sovereign. Daniel Lenz, DZ Bank's lead market strategist for euro-zone
sovereigns, says that following the rating upgrade Ireland will now also move to the "A" basket of the
iBoxx Eurozone Sovereign Index. The 10-year Irish government bond is trading at a yield of 1.95%,
according to Tradeweb, down from 2.07% at Friday's close. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0706 GMT [Dow Jones]-- Commerzbank expects Germany to set a 0% coupon, or annual fixed interest
payment, on a new series of Treasury notes it will launch Wednesday. The German Finance Agency will
launch the new, September 2016-dated Treasury note, known as Schatz, with an initial volume of EUR5
billion at an auction Wednesday, and will set the coupon Tuesday. The current German two-year
benchmark Schatz, which matures in June 2016, is trading at a yield of -0.005% which makes a 0%
coupon likely on the coming new line, says Commerzbank's rates strategist Michael Leister.

0705 GMT [Dow Jones] The flare-up in Russia/Ukraine tensions late Friday triggered a safety rush into
the franc, with EUR/CHF tumbling to a 20-month low of 1.2086. Over the weekend talks were held with
the two nations plus France and Germany which have helped stabilize the markets. EUR/CHF now at
1.2107. Elsewhere the USD is pretty much where Europe left it against the majority of G10 peers, sterling
is a touch firmer on press comments from BoE Governor Carney that neither the slow growth of wages or
the strength of sterling would be a deterrent against raising rates. Up ahead there is no first tier data
Monday, event risk is back loaded this week with BoE and FOMC minutes Wednesday, PMIs Thursday
and Jackson Hole on Friday. (gary.stride@wsj.com)

0629 GMT [Dow Jones] Speculative capital flew out of China in July, says Goldman Sachs. Foreign
exchange purchases for the entire banking system increased by only around US$6 billion in July. "The
low print despite a record trade surplus suggests there was continued significant 'hot money' outflow in
July," says Goldman. "The slow inflow is consistent with the lack of premium of the offshore vs onshore
RMB in July." It estimates the total hot money outflow in July as US$44.5 billion, assuming stable foreign
direct investment. (jacky.wong@wsj.com; Twitter: @jackycwong)

0627 GMT [Dow Jones]--New record levels are in store this week as Bunds and peripherals both look
well-supported. "Issuance remains subdued, and while our economists are looking for a significant
upside surprise in the euro area PMIs, market reaction to sentiment data will likely remain asymmetric
with markets still digesting a recent poor run of hard data," says Commerzbank. The bank remains a

0.985%. (nick.cawley@wsj.com)

0615 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares end down 0.7% at 9141.31, as declines in biotech and solar
shares weigh on the market. Biotech declines were led by Medigen (3176.TW), which has fallen daily
since announcing two weeks ago that preliminary results showed no effect from PI-88, its once-promising
cancer drug in development. Medigen shares were down the daily limit of 7% at NT$139.50 Monday.
"Medigen's bad news has cast a shadow over Taiwan's whole biotech sector. A lot of the high hopes for
these new drugs seem to be a dream," said Hua Nan Securities assistant vice president Henry Miao. The
market was bolstered by a boost in some tech suppliers, with Wistron (3231.TW) up 3.3% at NT$33.30
and Pegatron (4938.TW) up 5.1% at NT$63.50. The Taiex is tipped for a 9120-9160 band for Tuesday.
