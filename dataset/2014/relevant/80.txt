ACQUISITIONS: Chinese groups continue to lead the charge on properties with residential
conversion potential, with a Shanghai-based developer snapping up an industrial property at
Waterloo in Sydney’s inner south for $46.6 million.
The deal comes amid reports yesterday that Chinese group Country Garden was in talks with Harry
Triguboff about a potential purchase of his Meriton business. The Australian in June revealed the
talks, in which Country Garden Australia chief executive Johnson Zhang said preliminary discussions
had been held.

In Waterloo, the fully leased industrial property, at 1029-1035 Bourke Road, 723 Elizabeth Street
and 409 George Street, has potential for a residential development in the medium to long term. It is
200m from Green Square railway station.

The deal, struck on a yield of 6.36 per cent, was handled by JLL’s Sam Brewer and Colliers
International’s Michael Crombie.
Tenants included Oroton Group, Tarocash and Versace Home, Mr Brewer said. “There is flexibility
to develop the property over the medium to long term, particularly once the City of Sydney’s Green
Square project is more mature,” he said.
On Saturday, Mirvac Groupsold 174 apartments in the first release of apartments at the long-term
$8 billion Green Square Town Centre — more than 10 years after the site was proposed for urban
renewal.

Mirvac and the NSW government will deliver about 2000 apartments, up to 14,000sq m of retail
space and about 50,000sq m of office space in the precinct.
The Waterloo property sold yesterday will be held as an industrial investment in the short term.

Mr Crombie said industrial properties in South Sydney would probably enjoy strong rental growth as
stock was being taken out of the market for residential development.“Currently rents are as much
as 40 per cent below those found in comparable properties within nearby suburbs,” he said.
