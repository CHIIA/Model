Kresta rise query

Kresta Holdings had no explanation yesterday for a 24 per cent spike in its share price. The window
furnishings company attracted a query from the Australian Securities Exchange after its stock closed
up 4¢ to 21¢ on higher-than-usual volume. The trading activity follows two Chinese investors taking
major stakes in Kresta in December.

Tick for centres split

Shopping centre group Westfield’s split of its Australian and New Zealand assets from its global
operations has been backed by KPMG. Under the plan, Westfield’s Australian and New Zealand
business, which includes 47 shopping centres, would merge with Westfield Retail Trust, a joint owner
of the Australian shopping centres, to become Scentre Group.

Aquila, Vale end feud

Aquila Resources has buried the hatchet with its Brazilian joint venture partner over the Eagle Downs
Hard Coking Coal project in Queensland.

The settlement of the dispute over infrastructure and development options will allow Aquila and Vale
to complete the $1.3 billion project.
