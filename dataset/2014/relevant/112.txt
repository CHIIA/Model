QM Properties' $25 million Mowbray East Brisbane residential project reported a full sell-out of its 56
one and two-bedroom apartments, six months ahead of building completion. QM Properties, owned by
the successful race horse breeder Jon Haseler, will now construct a $30 million mixed-use development
on a newly acquired 1214-square-metre site in the same suburb. QM Properties development manager
Glenn Rix said the suburb was undersupplied. "Recent research reports confirm sales activity is strong
and the sell-out of Mowbray and this recent acquisition reaffirms our belief that East Brisbane has all the
qualities purchasers are looking for," he said. Matthew Cranston

A private investor with ties to Asia has paid $61,000 per square metre for a 38-square-metre shop
across from Flinders Street Station in the Melbourne CBD. The premises of Backpackers Work Travel
sold under the hammer for $2.33 million on a net yield of 3.6 per cent. The property was marketed by
Daniel Wolman and Oliver Hay of Colliers International.

The low yield was a reflection of a tighter market and investors "keen to compete for well-located
properties" Mr Wolman said. More than 50 people attended the auction. Larry Schlesinger
