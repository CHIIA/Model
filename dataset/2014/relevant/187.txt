RESOURCES: Shares in Perth-based driller Ausdrill took a hit yesterday after it forecast revenue
would be lower after a $28 million contract was deferred. The company said Resolute Mining’s
decision to defer stage two of its Syama project in Mali impacted forecast revenue. “Ausdrill’s revenues
attributable to this contract will reduce by approximately $US3.5 million per month over the next eight
months,” the company said. Shares in Ausdrill were off 10.9 per cent at 45c.
MINING: Mount Gibson Iron has placed its shares in a trading halt amid ongoing problems at its
Koolan Island mine. Repair work in the main pit of the mine, in Western Australia’s Kimberley Region,
has been going on for about a month. Mount Gibson said the work had been interrupted by a further
slump in the pit’s seawall.

spend the next two months behind bars ahead of a court appearance in February. Steven Xiao faces

Chinese miner Hanlong in Australia to profit by $1.4m. Lawyers for Mr Xiao and the director of
commonwealth public prosecutions appeared in the NSW Supreme Court yesterday, with Mr Xiao’s
case being adjourned until February 25.

firmTabcorp. Tabcorp said Ellerston and its associates ceased being a substantial shareholder on
