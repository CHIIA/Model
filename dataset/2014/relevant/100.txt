Sydney - Thursday - Nov 20: (RWE Australian Business News) -

***************************

Surely talk of a possible $30m to $60m hit on compensation for faulty electrical cable didn't knock
$900m off WOOLWORTHS (ASX:WOW) yesterday.

But that's what seems to have happened.

Woolworths yesterday plunged 93c to as low as $32.07, which is a year low.

Even though the price later crawled back up to $32.26, it's a miserable end for the year for shareholders
in the retailer.

Actually, Woolworths has fallen eight days in a row, seven little ones and one monster.

Coles supermarket owner WESFARMERS (ASX:WES), which has had six falls in a row, joined
Woolworths in the pits with a 78c fall to $42.89.

It does not seem to be involved in the electrical cables mess so the sellers of shares in the two big
supermarket chains may have had other complaints.

They might have been spooked by reports of the growing threat to grocery market share from
international players like Aldi.

*****

The sharemarket may be having a lousy week but you wouldn't know it if you were a shareholder of
1-PAGE (ASX:1PG), which came out of trading halt to rise 6c on Tuesday and a further 10c to 58c
yesterday.
This followed the company's announcement it would buyBranchOut Inc, a professional networking
service built on the Facebook platform with more than 820 million profiles.

Consideration comprises $US2m cash and 7.5m shares in 1-Page, to be issued in 12 months.

No overhead will be added to 1-Page's monthly cost base.

BranchOut leverages users' social graphs and networks to help candidates find jobs.
With this acquisition, 1-Page intends to apply its proprietary technology to create "a revolutionary
employee referral service with detailed professional profiles based on the social graph".

1-Page says it leverages the social networks of professionals to enable companies to source
prospective candidates in an innovative and more effective way, connecting into their employee referral
process, allowing every employee to become, in effect, a recruiter.
The BranchOut acquisition has the potential to provide 1-Page with a much larger footprint into a global
recruiting market.

like online ads will be superseded by services that hook up employers with potential employees.

When FREEDOM FOODSGROUP (ASX:FNP) announced the signing of a memorandum of
understanding with Perich Group and China's New Hope Group, on Tuesday afternoon, the shares
reacted like a slow boat to China, drifting up just 3c to $2.95.

Well, yesterday it was full steam ahead with a 35c rise to $3.30 and a 12-month high of $3.41 at one
stage.

Which is more fitting for what is quite a big deal.

After all, the memorandum was signed during the official ceremonies in Canberra for the visit of
Chinese President Xi Jinping with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the formal signing of the
Australia China Free Trade Agreement.
The three parties intend to cooperate to develop and implement growth in long-term dairy milk supply
through establishment of new large-scale intensive dairy farms in southeast Australia for supply to
Freedom Foods Group's UHT operations and other potential processing operations in Australia
including fresh milk.

*****

ORICA (ASX:ORI) was all over the place yesterday after the profit announcement.

In the initial reaction the shares shot up 68c to $19.93 and shareholders were cheering.

Not for long, though.

Orica went on the skids and closed at $18.47, down 78c.

It was hard to determine what exactly the punters suddenly panicked about after the slightly higher profit
and slightly higher dividend.
Maybe it was that bit in the outlook which said, "the company does not expect a significant
improvement in the resources markets, reinforcing the requirement for the company to achieve its
transformation objectives".

Orica, by the way, has fallen seven days in a row.

*****
When RED FORK ENERGY (ASX:RFE) was queried on November 13 over a fall from 2c to 1.2c, it
could offer no explanation.
On Tuesday when the company was queried over a fall from 1.7c to 0.5c, it was still in the dark.

Yesterday Red Fork more than trebled to 1.7c and closed at 1.1c, up 0.6c.

Probably no point in querying it again.

However, it was interesting how turnover soared to 67m shares, which is the highest by far for the year.

*****

There must be some bad news coming from VENUS METALS (ASX:VMC) because the shares, up 3c in
the previous three days, slumped 6c to 13c.

The last announcement was the quarterly report on October 17 but on October 8 it announced that
diamond drilling had commenced at the PM Prospect, Copper Hills Project.
