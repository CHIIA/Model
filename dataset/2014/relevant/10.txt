EXCLUSIVE HONG Kong developer Golden Horse Holdings has emerged as the surprise buyer of a
massive residential site sold by Goodman Group in Sydney’s inner south for more than $350 million.
The deal is one Australia’s biggest sales for residential conversion and is part of a wave of Asian
capital that is pouring into the residential development space.

Office towers with residential conversion potential are expected to sell to other Asian groups this year,
with Hong Kong-listed Shimao Holdings thought to be closing in on 175 Liverpool Street in Sydney for
about $400m, while Asian developers are running the ruler over harbourside gem Gold Fields House
overlooking the Sydney Opera House.
The Goodman site sold to Golden Horse’s local arm, GH Properties, spans about 7ha in the suburb
Erskineville. The site has the potential for about 1765 residential dwellings.

It will signal the entry of Golden Horse into the Sydney market and will easily be its most ambitious
Australian project. In Queensland, the group is planning a 251-apartment tower in Brisbane’s inner
city Milton and in January it bought the Noosa Springs Golf Resort and housing development site.
Last December it purchased a site on the Gold Coast’s Hope Island with a view to building a
400-room hotel, and a majority shareholding in Hope Island Golf Links Resort.

The parties and the agent thought to have brokered the Erskineville deal, Colliers International’s
Michael Crombie, declined to comment.
The Australian revealed yesterday that Goodman had sold the site, which includes 57 Ashmore Street
and 165-175 Mitchell Road, but the buyer was not identified. Last month the company said it had
$500m of urban renewal sites on the market, under due diligence or sold in Australia and Britain.
The group holds industrial parks that have the potential to be converted into more than 35,000 unit
blocks in inner-city locations across Australia and has been selling since last year.
Hong Kong-listed Country Garden bought a North Ryde site from Goodman earlier in the year and is
now building a $500m apartment complex.
Golden Horse is registered in Hong Kong and owned by Feng Di, who owns a PGA-competition
54-hole golf resort in Guangzhou in southern China. The Golden Horse group owns 20 other
properties and has developed 3 million square metres across mainland China, its website says.Asian
groups have been active in Sydney recently. Shanghai-backed Aqualand has bought large sites in
Melrose Park and North Ryde, while Yuhu Group acquired a North Sydney office tower with plans for
an apartment conversion. And Dalian Yifang Group bought an amalgamation of homes in northern
Lane Cove for about $63m.
