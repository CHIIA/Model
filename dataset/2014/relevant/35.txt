China's ravenous demand for Australian beef could soon lead to some major cattle station
purchases, with one of several Chinese importers, Snow Dragon Group, looking to buy land.
Snow Dragon, owned by the Xuelong Industrial Group based in Dalian in northern China, has been
importing about $7 million worth of high-grade chilled Angus beef from Australia every year for the
last three years.

It is one of many that have seen the dollar value of Australian beef and veal exports to China surge
3273 per cent in the past five years, according to Meat and Livestock Australia.

Snow Dragon director of quality management Chen Hong, who oversees a 10,000-head feedlot in
Dalian, said the company wanted to rapidly expand and "co-operate in a closer way" with Australia.

"Because supply is less than demand we had to start importing beef from Australia," Mr Chen said
through an interpreter. "We hope we can import more beef from Australia.
"We have a plan to purchase farmland in Australia soon. The details are to be decided by the
board."
The company's move to buy farmland for breeding cattle fits in with a renewed drive by
Chinese-based companies to invest in Australian agriculture.

A spokesman for trade for the Development and Reform Commission of the Dalian Government said
the central government had encouraged Chinese companies to invest overseas.

"Many enterprises from Dalian have began to invest in other countries, including Australia.

"The forms of investment include purchasing farms, including cotton planting and livestock, [as well
as] animal husbandry," the spokesman said.Prominent entries
Already this year several Chinese-based companies have entered the Australian farmland market.
Yiang Xiang Assets bought barrister Allan Myers' Elizabeth Downs station in the Northern Territory,
while Shanghai-based Orient Agriculture bought the cotton farm Undabri in southern Queensland.

Snow Dragon representatives would not give details on where or precisely when it would make its
move, but with surging growth in demand for beef in China the company's investment is likely to
come soon.
Australia now accounts for 53 per cent of China's total beef imports and ANZ director of
agribusiness research Michael Whitehead has forecast that our beef exports to China could
skyrocket to $130 billion by 2030.

a free trade deal that will have Australia's beef and cattle exports, and the Chinese restrictions on
them, high on the list of negotiation items.
