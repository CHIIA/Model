Kin Mining has strengthened its ground holdings around Leonora by securing a prospective
tenement package south of the 7Moz Sons of Gwalia gold mine.

The deal expands Kin’s footprint along the Gwalia shear zone to 24km as it seeks to complete its
acquisition of the Leonora gold project from Navigator Resources.

Kin managing director Trevor Dixon said the geological sequence was similar to the setting that
hosted St Barbara’s producing mines at Gwalia and King of the Hills.

“This outstanding ground package puts us right on the doorstep of the well-endowed Sons of
Gwalia mine,” he said.

“First pass evaluation has identified the Annapurna prospect as an immediate walk-up drill target,
although the entire shear zone is prospective.”

Kin has also engaged geophysical consultants Newexco to undertake a survey of its Kingfisher
project south of Leonora.

Diamond drilling in the 1970s and 1980s at Kingfisher returned hits of 2 per cent nickel and 4.8 per
cent copper.

Newexco is known for its part in discovering Western Areas’ Spotted Quoll and Flying Fox nickel
mines in the Forrestania region.
Since June, Kin has been trying to raise $5.8 million to fund the Leonora acquisition.
The company has secured a $3 million investment through an unnamed Chinese investor and
this week extended the offer period until October 10.
