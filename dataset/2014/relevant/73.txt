***************************

What a difference a weekend made.

GUD HOLDINGS (ASX:GUD) was punished by the market on Friday after announcing a 44pc fall in net
profit to $17.7 million and halving the year-end payout from 36c (including a 10c special dividend) to
18c.

The shares fell 74c to as low as $6.44 before closing at $6.60.

But all was forgiven yesterday with the price rebounding 65c to a 52-week high of $7.25.

Investors probably took another look at the section in the results on outlook, where managing director
Jonathan Ling said, "FY14 was a year of transition for GUD.

"The benefits of the restructuring programs implemented during the year will become evident in FY15,
with the full $10m annualised benefit to accrue in FY16."

Mr Ling noted, "Additionally, the profit improvement programs under way have identified a total of $20m
of annualised benefit, which we expect to capture over the next two years.

"These programs span many operational aspects including supply chain, cost-to-serve, warranty and
product rationalisation.

"The long-term success of GUD is also tied to the realisation of the product and service innovation
initiatives currently occurring in every business.

"I am encouraged, following recent presentations of the first ideas, that these will provide GUD with
substantial growth."

"Our expectation is that GUD will deliver an improved financial performance with growth contributions
from all businesses, particularly Dexion and Sunbeam, in the FY15 year," he concluded.

As promised, KIBARAN RESOURCES (ASX:KNL) has delivered its final batch of Reverse Circulation
drill results from its Epanko deposit within the Mahenge Graphite Project in Tanzania.
And the company said these latest results again surpassed all the recently announced intersections
with 53m at 14.0pc Total Graphitic Carbon and 54m at 8.6pc TGC, including 19m at 10.4pc TGC.

The program has doubled the strike length of Epanko graphite mineralisation to more than 1km,
providing significant upside potential to the size of the deposit.

An upgrade of the existing JORC Inferred Mineral Resource (14.9Mt at 10.5pc TGC for 1.56Mt of
contained graphite) to an Indicated/Measured category is under way.

heavy profit-taking yesterday.

Which is fair enough, considering the price is still double that ruling before the first Epanko drill result
announcement two weeks ago.

Those who bought in at the top (60c on July 21) will be interested to know Taylor Collison yesterday
rated Kibaran a speculative buy with a price target of 76c.

*****
Cardiovascular medical device company USCOM (ASX:UCM) released a promising Appendix 4C
quarterly cash flow report yesterday with receipts from customers up 148pc to $0.26m and operating
cash flows improving from an outflow of $0.37m in the March quarter to a $0.07m outflow.

The stock rose 3.5c to 25.5c yesterday but it must be added that volume was just 3000 shares and the
rise didn't make up the 4c fall recorded when it last traded on July 18.
Still, the company said it made considerable progress during the quarter with commercialisation and
scale-up activities of its lead products, the USCOM 1A (which is FDA, CE Mark and TGA approved) and
the newly developed Uscom BP+ (with FDA, CE Mark and pending TGA).

In relation to the USCOM 1A cardiac output monitoring product, sales continued to grow through the
existing sales channels in the US, China, and the EU and UK.

As we've often said, there's nothing like a placement to kill a rising share price.

TRITON MINERALS (ASX:TON) went into trading halt two weeks ago at 61c for the announcement of a
placement of 17m shares at 50c to raise $8.5m to accelerate exploration activity and studies at Balama
North.

The shares actually peaked at 90.5c later that week, but have been on a downward spiral since.

Even an announcement yesterday confirming a fresh batch of assay results from the RC drilling
program had helped to better define and expand multiple high-grade zones of the graphite
mineralisation at Nicanda Hill couldn't save the stock, which fell 10c to 55c.

*****
FIRESTRIKE RESOURCES (ASX:FIE) had its first sale yesterday since July 17 and the price rose 0.4c
to 2.9c.
This followed the announcement that "exciting" copper assays had confirmed mineralisation below
surface at the Copper Ridge Project in Utah from tests using a small depth capacity rig.

By the way, punters looking at the late reports may have been confused by the ASX releasing the
Firestrike announcement a second time.

*****

IPROPERTY GROUP (ASX:IPP) was all over the place yesterday but it was all good.

The shares opened at $3.65, fell to $3.42, bounced back to $3.71 and then closed at $3.69, up 57c on
the day.

There was no mystery over the reason for the excitement given that the high-flying REA GROUP
(ASX:REA) had taken up a 17.22pc stake from French portal operator SeLoger.com for $106m.

Obviously the punters were willing to pay more than the $3.40 REA paid for its 31.3m shares.

Also, iProperty rose four days in a row ahead of the announcement, although there was not a lot in it
given the price rose only from $2.91 to $3.12.
