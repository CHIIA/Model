Energy: British gas giant BG Group will start the sale of its Queensland gas pipelines within a month,
with four parties likely to bid more than $2.5 billion for assets related to its Queensland Curtis Island
liquefied natural gas project.
Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Li Ka-shing, will bid on its
own, just weeks after sealing its $2.4bn takeover of gas distributor Envestra.

The other three parties are believed to be consortiums. Industry Funds Management will bid jointly
with Queensland Investment Corp and Canada’s Enbridge.

Hastings Funds Management has teamed up with Canadian infrastructure investor Borealis and
Germany’s Allianz, while the APA Group has been joined by Japan’s Marubeni.
The sale could be valued at about $2.5bn, but that depends on how BG structures it or whether the
sale includes other related assets, one source said.
BG has been looking to monetise assets to expand its global explorations.The company sold a 40
per cent in its QCLNG project to China’s CNOOC for $US1.9bn in 2012, and signed a 20-year supply
agreement with Tokyo Gas. But BG still retains 100 per cent ownership of the pipeline assets.
Goldman Sachs is advising BG on the sale.
