Sydney - Friday - January 24: (RWE Australian Business News) -

*****************************

InterOil Corporation has not been seen on the ASX list since 2005, though there has been some talk of
a possible relisting.

In the past eight years it has become a major gas player in Papua New Guinea and is listed on the New
York and Port Moresby stock exchanges.
If ever there was a strong pointer to acquire shares in a possible relaunch of a now successful company
it is InterOil Corporation.
The company's fortunes took a turn for the better last year when former Woodside man Mike Hession
became the new chief executive.
InterOil in December realised its ambitions in PNG after signing up French oil major Total in a
multi-billion-dollar deal to join in its gas venture.

According to the AFR, the partners want to develop InterOil's Elk and Antelope gasfields as the basis for
an LNG project in PNG.
InterOil will hold a 30 per cent stake in the venture.

Meanwhile, the latest publicity surrounds Mr Hession poaching a number of key management staff from
WOODSIDE PETROLEUM (ASX:WPL).

They include Jon Ozturgut, Woodies' former senior vice president who becomes InterOil's chief
operating officer in charge of mergers and acquisitions, and Donald Spector, the strategy expert who
was Woodside's taxation and Treasury man.

InterOil and Woodside are very much alike, less so in price.

Steven Goh - the man who developed Sanford Securities, Australia's first online stockbroker, which was
taken over by IWL which was in turn acquired by CommSec - is back.

His new project is mig33, a "social entertainment platform".

It is tailored for emerging markets across Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East and Africa that
represent a population of more than 3.5 billion people, and monetises not through advertising, but
primarily through the sale of virtual gifts and games.
Now LATIN GOLD (ASX:LAT) has entered a heads of agreement to acquire mig33 in return for the
issue of 720 million shares.

The proposal will effectively result in mig33 making a backdoor listing on the ASX.

Page19of243©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.It certainly explains this week's rush for the usually lightly traded Latin Gold, whose shares surged 1.1c
to 2c in two days before trading was halted on Wednesday afternoon.
In response to an ASX query, the company noted yesterday's announcement ... but, hang on, the
queried trading took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, so it couldn't possibly have been due to Latin
Gold's plan to buy mig33, since no-one would have known about it at that time.

Yesterday afternoon, when everyone knew, the shares resumed trading and jumped a further 1.2c to
3.2c before closing at 2.7c.

Speaking of backdoor listings, BULLETPROOF GROUP (ASX:BPF) was a bullet performer when it
made its much-awaited ASX listing yesterday.

The reverse takeover of Spencer Resources has resulted in "Australia's first publicly traded pure play
cloud services company".

Investors who rushed last month's capital raising (and were lucky enough to receive an allocation) were
on Cloud Nine when the 27c shares opened at 50c and trading between 50.5c and 38c before closing at
43c.

It's little wonder there is all this interest when the business is attracting big names.

Bulletproof recently launched Australia's first managed Amazon Web Services (AWS) On-Demand
service, and was named in late 2013 as Australia's only AWS Premier Consulting Partner.

In parallel with that innovation and recognition, Bulletproof secured a number of significant client
contract wins in 2013, including Seek, Racing Victoria, Tennis Australia and Bauer Media.

*****

ELEMENTAL MINERALS (ASX:ELM) has completed the drawdown of $10m to $15m available under
the convertible note facility being provided by Hong Kong-listed Dingyi Group investment.

The shares rose 1.5c to 29.5c yesterday.

Yesterday, Elemental received a second notice extending Dingyi's takeover offer by two months to now
close at 7pm (Sydney time) on March 31, unless further extended.

*****
Exotic offshore mining explorers certainly have their ups and downs.

Take ZAMBEZI RESOURCES (ASX:ZRL), which received approval by the Zambian Government to
develop its Kangaluwi copper project, overturning a previous decision to reject the company's
environmental impact study.

The shares soared from 8c to 40c on Tuesday but by yesterday Zambezi was changing hands at 21c.
