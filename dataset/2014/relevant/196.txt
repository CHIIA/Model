The chances of a corporate partnership between the newly enlarged BC Iron and Baosteel have
improved, after the Chinese steel giant poached Kerry Stokes' top iron ore man this week.
Alwyn Vorster has spent the past four years running Mr Stokes' Iron Ore Holdings, which is being
acquired by BC Iron in a friendly takeover. Mr Vorster was expected to become a non-executive director
of BC Iron when the deal was completed, but has instead been appointed by Baosteel and its partner
Aurizon to run the Aquila mining business that they acquired earlier this year.

Baosteel and Aurizon want to build $5 billion of rail and port infrastructure in the west pilbara, and BC
Iron has acknowledged that such an asset could be a good option for exporting iron ore from the
Buckland Project it acquired in the recent Iron Ore Holdings takeover.
BC Iron managing director Morgan Ball declined to comment on the potential for Mr Vorster's move to
smooth the path towards a rail and port partnership with Baosteel, Aurizon and Aquila, but said it could
help unlock some synergies on mining projects. "The ore body beneath our Buckland tenements abuts
into an Aquila tenement, and it makes far more sense to develop that jointly than two separate
operations, so I think from a mining perspective it is a real positive that we have someone there at
Baosteel who understands the synergies that can be achieved through all of that and that is something
we would engage with Alwyn about at the appropriate time," he said.
BC Iron owns more than 90 per cent of Iron Ore Holdings and has moved into the compulsory
acquisition stage. Mr Stokes has become BC Iron's biggest shareholder with just over 19 per cent.
BC Iron is due to report its quarterly update on Tuesday, and its shares closed 3.5¢ higher at $1.425 on
Wednesday.
