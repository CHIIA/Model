Sydney - Thursday - June 12: (RWE Australian Business News) -

****************************

Yesterday's struggling retailer can be today's takeover target.
We said that a week ago and put the spotlight on NONI B (ASX:NBL) after the company disclosed it had
been approached by third parties interested in a potential takeover bid.

This week it was PACIFIC BRANDS's (ASX:PBG) turn.
The company on Tuesday downgraded its forecast for the year to June 30 to $90-93m EBIT before
significant items on 3pc sales growth.

Performance improvement and cost reduction initiatives have been accelerated and expanded, and a
strategic review has been initiated with the appointment of Macquarie Capital.

With the shares falling 5c to 51c Tuesday, the reduced price reportedly attracted renewed attention from
private equity with the idea of restructuring, refocusing, degearing and ... eventually ... relisting (no doubt
at a significant price - last time hapless investors paid $2.50 a share).

The takeover talk saw PacBrands rebound 2c to 53c yesterday.
Meanwhile, investors were getting toey in Noni B, which fell 4.5c to 49c, down from 56.5c on June 4
when it reported the approach.

*****

FLIGHT CENTRE TRAVEL GROUP (ASX:FLT) performed a sort of loop-the-loop yesterday as investors
digested its profit downgrade.

The shares dived $1.08 to $44.82 in the opening minutes, but soon went into a climb to be up 97c at
$46.87.

It finished up 53c at $46.43.

The group expects to achieve a record underlying profit before tax of $370-380m for the year to June 30.

This is at the low to mid point of current market guidance and represents 8-11pc growth on 2012/13.

Admittedly, the stock had lost a fair bit of altitude in the previous five sessions - a total of $4.58 in fact -
so it wasn't all that surprising to see the bargain-hunters jump in.

*****

CYNATA THERAPEUTICS (ASX:CYP) has rallied nicely from its 12-month low of 28c plumbed three
weeks ago.

Page163of284©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The shares rose 4c to 46c yesterday after the company announced plans to partner with Grey
Innovation to develop potential treatments for lung disorders by enabling the direct delivery of Cymerus
stem cells into the lung via a specialised nebuliser system.

"There remains a significant medical need for treatments of a number of serious and debilitating lung
disorders, including treating underdeveloped lungs in newborn babies and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) in adults.

"There is great excitement in the scientific and medical communities about the potential of stem cells to
help meet this growing need, and initial research efforts suggest that these treatments may hold great
promise for the future," Cynata said.

Puzzlingly, despite the "great excitement", the announcement was not deemed market sensitive.

*****
CAULDRON ENERGY (ASX:CXU) has been on the boil this month.
The company was queried by the ASX after rising from 9.6c on April 29 to 16c on May 27 and it was
able to come up with a bunch of reasons for the surge.

It was back in the news on Tuesday when it secured $11m in funding via a series of placements with
Chinese investors at 11.8c.

The placement shares have already more than doubled in value with Cauldron rising 2.5c Tuesday and a
further 5.5c to 30.5c yesterday.

*****

FRONTIER RESOURCES (ASX:FNT) might be a minnow but its lucky shareholders have seen the value
of their investment rise 400pc in the past year.

It was the punters' favourite yesterday after reporting 10 jackhammer trenches had demonstrated more
than 215m strike length of very high to moderate grade gold in the Upper Zone at the Swit Kia Prospect
(formerly Suguma) in Papua New Guinea with "excellent strike/dip/plunge/regional structural repetition
potential".

The shares jumped 1.3c to 2.5c (up from a year low of 0.5c) before closing at 2.3c.

Turnover was a well-above-average 21m shares.

*****

Shareholders of THE REJECT SHOP (ASX:TRS) flinch every time they see the words "trading update".

You can't blame them.

Back on January 24 an update saw the shares plunge from $16.90 to $10.85 in two days.

After Tuesday's trading update, they slid to a new low of $7.95.

The stock tried valiantly to recover yesterday, rising 50c to $8.55 at one stage, but falling away to close
at $8.24.

*****

FIFTH ELEMENT RESOURCES (ASX:FTH) continues to amaze investors.

The shares rose another 11c to 95c yesterday.

The 20c stock, which joined the lists at 22c on May 21, was queried last Wednesday when the price hit
68c.
The company had no explanation for the rise, which makes the 27c further improvement since then all
the more interesting.
