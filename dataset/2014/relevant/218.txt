Neon, MEO deal ‘fair’
Independent expert KPMG has ruled that Neon Energy’s proposed merger with MEO Australia is fair
and reasonable for MEO shareholders, who have to vote on the scrip-swap deal. The $35 million
merger will combine cashed-up Neon with MEO’s exploration assets. But it faces several hurdles,
including a rival takeover bid from Mosman Oil & Gas for MEO, rejected by the target, and a campaign
by Neon’s biggest shareholder Evoworld to sack Neon’s board. Evoworld has also submitted another
bid for Neon, which the target said would be superior to the MEO merger but remained incomplete,
non-binding and uncertain. Investors are due to vote on the Neon merger on February 2.

Boodarie boost
Plans for a $200 million waste-to-energy plant on the outskirts of Port Hedland at Boodarie, the site of
BHP Billiton’s failed HBI plant, have gained momentum. The City of Karratha has awarded a tender for
New Energy Corp to take up to 60,000 tonnes of waste a year from Karratha to the Boodarie site. New
Energy expects Boodarie to be operational by 2017.

Leftovers snapped up

Graphite hopeful IMX Resources has placed a big chunk of the substantial shortfall of stock left over
from a $3 million non-renounceable entitlement offer with clients of Cannacord Genuity. The
Cannacord placement raised $1.7 million, adding to the $207,488 of stock that was originally taken up
by the company’s shareholders.

Phoenix, Norton tick
Chinese-controlled Norton Gold Fields has Foreign Investment Review Board approval to take a 10.8
per cent stake in Phoenix Gold. The deal is part of Norton’s plan to secure ore for its Paddington mill.

Receiver moves in

KordaMentha has been appointed as receiver to Viento Group subsidiary Power Infrastructure Services
(Powins). It follows the appointment of a provisional liquidator to Powins because of an internal row.
