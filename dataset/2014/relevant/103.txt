Sydney - Tuesday - March 18: (RWE Australian Business News) -

****************************

PROGEN PHARMACEUTICALS (ASX:PGL) is showing a bit of form at last.

It was queried by the ASX last Friday over a rise from 53c to 66c that day.

That, as they say, was nothing.

The shares shot up a further 24.5c to 89.5c yesterday.
"However, the company believes that existing shareholders and investors are becoming increasingly
aware of the advancement of the company's late-stage drug PI-88 under development by licensee
Medigen Biotechnology Corporation which is on track for New Drug Application filings in Asia," it
suggested.

"PI-88 could potentially be the first drug approved for the treatment of primary liver cancer
(hepatocellular carcinoma) following surgical resection."

Less than two years ago they were giving the stock away at 11c.

Then again, in 1997, they were as high as $12.96.

*****

While we're down at the pharma, BENITEC BIOPHARMA (ASX:BLT) has had a rough ride.

Less than a month ago it was $2.38, but fell 5c to $1.85 on Thursday after an innocuous-seeming
update on timing of first patient dosing in a Hepatitis C Trial.

Next day, on Friday, coinciding with the release of an investor presentation, the shares plunged 35c to
as low as $1.50.

Just to show it did not mean anything, Benitec bounced 33c to $1.92 yesterday before closing at $1.85.

*****

DULUXGROUP (ASX:DLX) indicates the settlement of the Alesco New Zealand OCN tax case has lifted
a weight off the company.

Its shares yesterday rose 4c to $5.43.

DuluxGroup announced on Friday that its subsidiary, Alesco NZ Ltd, had reached an out-of-court
settlement with the New Zealand Commissioner of Inland Revenue in relation to its OCN (Optional
Convertible Note) matter.

Terms of the settlement are confidential.

be towards, but less than, the $NZ12.7m provision that it held against the matter at September 30.

DuluxGroup will provide further details when it releases its half-year results in May.

The last time there was a burst of activity in MRL CORP (ASX:MRF) shares, on March 7, was the day
after it announced a fully underwritten 4-for-5 issue at 2.5c.

Despite that deep discount the shares still fell from 4.5c to 3.4c.

That may have been a mistake.

Yesterday MRL announced "exciting" initial analytical results from its Sri Lankan graphite projects.

The shares jumped 1.1c to 5.3c.

*****

GRYPHON MINERALS (ASX:GRY) has sold its holding of 22.3m shares in RENAISSANCE MINERALS
(ASX:RNS) to "predominately existing North American and Australian institutional shareholders".

As a result of Gryphon no longer being a shareholder in Renaissance, Mel Ashton has resigned as a
non-executive director.
Chairman Alan Campbell said, "Mel was a founding director of the company and, on behalf of the
company, I would like to thank Mel for his contribution and commitment to the company over the past
years."

Renaissance believes the current structure of the board, comprising two independent non-executive
directors (including the non-executive chairman) and the managing director, is suitable for the
company's current position.

Shares in Renaissance ended up 0.1c to 9.5c yesterday after touching 10.5c earlier in the day.

*****
ORINOCO GOLD (ASX:OGX) has identified numerous historical drill intercepts that point to a significant
extension of known mineralisation at the Sertao goldmine in central Brazil, where it is acquiring 100pc of
the gold rights from TROY RESOURCES (ASX:TRY).
Since announcing the proposed acquisition, Orinoco has made significant progress in advancing the
Sertao Project, which is located in the Faina greenstone belt close to the company's Faina Goldfields
Project.
Orinoco's strategy is to generate cash flow from its high-grade gold projects in this region which in turn
will be used to grow and expand those projects in addition to advancing exploration at its large IOCG
project, Tinteiro.

Shares in Orinoco rose 1.5c to 11.5c, but later gave that gain back to finish steady at 10c.

They have been struggling to move off the year's low of 9c plumbed on February 6.

*****

AGENIX (ASX:AGX) seems to have a lot going for it that is not reflected in its share price of 1.6c, steady
yesterday.

The group relied upon the shortfall and placement made to sophisticated investors in May 2013 to fund
operations for the six months ended December 31.
It has been in negotiations for the divestment of its hepatitis B treatment, AGX-1009, following the
successful completion of preclinical trials.
The agreement reached with a Chinese pharmaceutical company provides that Agenix
Biopharmaceutical Co Shanghai Limited (ABSL) will receive $US2m (before costs and taxes) following
the transfer and registration of intellectual property and patents to the benefit of the purchaser.

Settlement is to be secured by way of bank guarantee for the principal amount.

Page304of315©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.Upon receipt of these funds it is the group's intention to cease all activity in China and repatriate the
funds after paying all costs in relation to the sale and the closure of ABSL.

The group continues to have as a backstop a continuous investment agreement with Baycrest Capital
entered into on January 31 2013 for the provision of up to $3m over three years.

Subject to its conditions, Agenix has full control over the timing, price and number of shares Baycrest
purchases.

During the half-year the group undertook identification and analysis of, and due diligence with, a
comprehensive list of world-class strategic partners suitable for advancing the Thromboview clot
diagnostic intellectual property.

It continued business development of the DiagnostiQ point-of-care diagnostic platform technology.

*****

AUROCH MINERALS (ASX:AOU) has given shareholders an update on its near-term route to
production for development of the non-refractory resources at the Fair Bride, Dot's Luck, Guy Fawkes
and Boa Esperanga deposits.

A key objective of the Stage 1 development strategy has been to ensure a robust IRR, a positive NPV
and an economically sustainable standalone project, while critically creating a pathway to unlock the
value of the total resource of 2.82Moz Au through Stages 2 and 3.

This is achieved despite the Stage 1 development carrying directly and indirectly $US24.2m of costs
that will directly benefit Stages 2 and 3, with lower operating costs and capital expenditures.

Alas, the shares yesterday fell 3c to 10.5c.
