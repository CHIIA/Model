IN BRIEF

Banks’ rating down

THE scourge of “too-big-to-fail” banks in the UK is receding, according to Moody’s credit rating
agency.

Moody’s downgraded the outlook of British financial institutions yesterday from stable to negative
and said the reason was the increasing likelihood that banks would not be able to count on a public
bailout if they were to get into trouble again.
The previous Labour government pumped $119 billion of taxpayers’ money into Lloyds and the
Royal Bank of Scotland during the 2008–09 financial crisis because officials judged that allowing
those insolvent banks to go bankrupt would inevitably impose catastrophic costs on the wider
economy.

Since then, politicians and regulators have been trying to tackle the problem of too-big-to-fail by
establishing a legal resolution regime for complex troubled financial institutions, whereby unsecured
bondholders would automatically take losses in a crisis. – INM

African pledge
US companies have pledged $14 billion of investment in Africa in areas such as energy and
infrastructure, US President Barack Obama has said.

The BBC reports the announcement came at the first US-Africa Leaders’ Summit, attended by more
than 40 African heads of state.
The summit is an effort to strengthen US ties with Africa as China increases investments in Africa.
The deals include a $5 billion partnership between private-equity firmBlackstone and Aliko
Dangote, Africa’s richest businessman, for energy infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa.
