Brookfield Asset Management has bought Thayer Lodging Group, a closely held, Maryland-based
investor in hotels including a Ritz-Carlton and a JW Marriott in San Francisco. Thayer's seven funds
have made 43 hotel investments for total acquisition costs of about $2.5 billion since the company's
1991 founding. It will now operate as a unit of Brookfield. Bloomberg
Architecture firm HBO+EMTB has appointed Paul Weston as head of architecture at its Melbourne
studio as it seeks to strengthen its transport infrastructure, health and education business in the wake of
what it says is a cyclical peak in residential work. Mr Weston, who comes from Silver Thomas Hanley,
will join interiors and workplace head Tina Bernadi and urban and landscape design head Mark Stolz.

A Sydney property and private equity group PortNordica has bought two Tweed Coast caravan parks
for more than $10 million. Tweed Heritage Caravan Park is about 60 per cent manufactured home
sites, while the adjoining Chinderah Lakes Caravan Park is purely a caravan park. Both parks will
come under the management of residential park manager Gateway Lifestyle, in a deal negotiated by
Ray White agent Sam Johnson. The sales came in the same week Sydney asset manager Alceon paid
$3.5 million for the Acacia Ponds Village near Merimbula on the NSW South Coast. CBRE agent
Andrew Jackson sold the manufactured home park for Tannai, a consortium of local landowners.
