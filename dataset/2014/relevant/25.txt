A crowd of more than 500 people is expected to attend the March 28 auction of a cafe in Glen
Waverley, Melbourne with an address which bears the number 88, symbolising fortune and good luck
in Chinese culture. The 150-square-metre cafe at 88 Kingsway is expected to sell for $2.5 million-plus
on a yield well below 3 per cent. More than 150 expressions of interest have been received.

"It will be a spectacle. Buyers are not interested in yield," said Joseph Catanese, who is marketing the
property alongside Savills colleague Clinton Baxter. LARRY SCHLESINGER
