Sydney - Monday - December 15: (RWE Australian Business News) -

******************************

The Australian sharemarket is likely to fall again today after a whacking great retreat on the Dow Friday
of 316 points or 1.79pc while the S&P 500 also traded seriously lower, along with the Nasdaqs.

The Dow 30 list were all negative.
In the market energy stocks dropped again, including Australia's big miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.
The other influencing factor was the Chinese data details that emerged Friday.
While US retail sales and fixed asset investment figures were largely in line with forecasts, Chinese
industrial production growth slowed more than expected from 7.7pc to 7.2pc year-on-year.

The consensus forecast was for an annual increase of 7.5pc.

The monthly increase in Eurozone industrial production also slowed to just 0.1pc in October from 0.5pc
the month before, missing the 0.2pc estimate.

By rights the falling fuel prices around the globe are brilliant for growth but the offset is in countries
selling oil to keep a balanced bottom line that are heading for disaster.
The major oil company shares continue to plunge - with January WTI futures off a further $2.14 to
$57.81 barrel and Tapis $1.92 to $65.55 barrel, the price used to set Australian fuel prices.

For example, the average household would have saved at least $30 to $50 on petrol when filling up
their tanks this week as the slide in oil prices have seen service stations cut their prices up to $1.11 a
litre in the Sydney metropolitan area against $1.40-50 a week ago.

The December SPI 200 futures contract lost 32 to 5183.
Gold was bad news with the December contract down $3.20 to $1222 on COMEX.

The AUD weakened after RBA Governor Glenn Stevens suggested the Aussie should be changing
hands around US75c but a realistic price is probably at US78c after the Governor started to think about
cutting rates again - a disaster for seniors relying on the present income to make ends meet.

Mr Stevens's words seem to have done a lot of good as the AUD dropped back to US82.50c and
touched a four-year low of US82.27c at one stage during the session.

INDEPENDENCE GROUP (ASX:IGO) last week announced ongoing drilling at the Moran South target
had intersected 5.4m at 12.38pc nickel of massive sulphide (true width 3.5m) in drillhole LSU-493.
The intercept is 1140m below surface, 320m south of the Moran nickel ore body and 90m below the
recently completed Moran South Drill Drive platform.

The intercept comprises massive sulphide in an ultramafic-basalt contact position and is coincidental
with a significant downhole electromagnetic (DHEM) geophysical response identified from drillhole LSU
-492, drilled down dip of LSU-493.

This intercept comes from the third underground diamond drillhole out of a proposed nine-hole
exploration program to identify the Long-Moran komatiite channel, south and down-plunge of the Moran
ore body, east of the Moran East fault.

Further step-out drilling to the south is planned to test down-plunge of the current intercept in the
coming months.

Managing director Peter Bradford said, "Although one drillhole does not make a discovery, this is an
important step in identifying the potential southern extensions of the Moran ore body.

"We are particularly pleased at the high tenor of mineralisation, which is similar to Moran, and look
forward to further drill-testing of this target position by the Long exploration team in the coming months."

Shares in Independence traded erratically last week and fell 19c to $4.13 on Friday.

SPARK NEW ZEALAND (ASX:SPK) has won support in the market with its price hikes to reflect Chorus
(ASX:CNU) wholesale copper line costs.

Spark said it would change the price of selected home phone and broadband plans from February 1
2015, following last week's NZ Commerce Commission draft decision on the amount that Chorus can
charge Spark and other Retail Service Providers (RSPs) for access to the copper network.

Last week's draft decision signalled:

* a $5.40 increase (incl GST) in the wholesale charges for home phone lines that have been in place for
the past two years; and

* a $4.54 increase (incl GST) in the broadband lines charges that took effect on December 1 2014.

Chorus has argued that an increase in charges to Spark and other RSPs must be backdated, and the
Commerce Commission has yet to give a view on this matter.

Page188of251©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The price of Spark's home phone-only plans and the 40GB and 80GB broadband plans (ADSL and
VDSL, excluding Ultra Fibre plans) will go up by between $2.50 and $4.25 a month from February 1
2015.

While these increases will affect lower-end plans, Spark says it will continue delivering more value to its
customers by lowering the price of Unlimited Broadband Data and home phone packages.

Spark Home, Mobile and Business chief executive Chris Quin said: "Over the past two years we have
been competing hard in the broadband market on the basis that there would be a $10 reduction in the
monthly charge we pay Chorus for providing copper broadband access.

"Market competition has brought great value for customers and the expected wholesale cost reduction
for Spark and other ISPs has been built into current broadband prices.

"For example, Spark's basic $75 broadband package today would have cost customers $105 two years
ago.

"Now it's indicated that wholesale broadband access charges will go down by almost $5, rather than
$10, and home phone access changes will go up by more than $5.

"We understand this is how the process works but we do have to react accordingly."

Mr Quin noted the monthly price increases of between $2.50 and $4.25 meant that Spark would only
partially recover increases in wholesale charges.

Spark shares fell 6c to $2.92 Friday, but rose every other day of last week, making a total gain of 22c for
the five days.
