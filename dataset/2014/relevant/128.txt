8.25 per cent. Robert Harley

Goodman Group has acted on its urban renewal strategy, selling the Ashmore Estate in South Sydney
for well over $350 million to Hong Kong-based Golden Horse Holdings. The site could yield more than
1700 apartments. Robert Harley
GDI Property Group has conditionally sold its 233 Castlereagh Street tower in the Sydney CBD for
$156 million to Shanghai-based fund manager Vision Investment Group. The sale, long flagged by
GDI, is through a conditional put and call option, subject to GDI gaining approval for an increase in floor
area by September 30 next year. The price is $27 million above the June 30 book value. Knight Frank's
John Bowie Wilson brokered the deal. The managing director of GDI, Steve Gillard, said the sale
validated the group's business model of buying well-located CBD office properties with multiple exit
options. Mercedes Ruehl
