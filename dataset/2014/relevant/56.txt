Horror year
New analysis by Deloitte shows $2.44 billion was wiped from the value of six of the Goldfields’
biggest bullion producers in a horror 2013.

That figure was the combined loss in market capitalisation of Regis Resources, Silver Lake
Resources, Saracen Mineral Holdings, St Barbara, Norton Gold Fields and Ramelius Resources last
year. The miners produced a combined total of 1.15 million ounces of gold last financial year, led by
St Barbara (364,601oz) and Regis (269,013oz).

New chairman
Exploration companyMidas Resources appointed experienced geologist Russell Davis as its new
chairman on Monday.
Midas’ portfolio includes the Leonora gold project, Pilbara iron ore project and copper-gold assets
in Queensland.
Mr Davis, who will receive director fees of $30,000 per annum, was a founding director of Gold Road
Resources.

Share surge
Northern Mining continued its unexplained share price rise, jumping as much as 11 per cent on
Tuesday.
On New Year’s Eve, Northern Mining responded to a second ASX price query in five weeks after its
shares jumped from 2.8 cents on December 24 to 4.7 cents in three trading days. Again there was
nothing new to report. The explorer’s main focus is the East Kalgoorlie project, which covers ground
near the Kanowna Belle gold mine and MacPhersons Resources’ Nimbus silver-gold-zinc project.

Moving forward
Chinese-backed Vector Resources this week began grade control drilling at its Gwendolyn project,
190km north of Southern Cross.
Vector, in which China’s Eagle Bright Holdings holds a stake worth about 16 per cent, has all the
mining approvals for a small-scale open pit operation.
Vector has secured a $3 million debt facility to fund the bulk sample campaign.

‘Rapid’ progress
Gold Road Resources continues to make “rapid” progress at its newest discovery, near its two
existing deposits, 150km east of Laverton.

mineralisation over 1600m strike at the Gruyere discovery. “We continue to be very encouraged with
the rapid growth of the Gruyere gold system since its discovery in October,” Gold Road’s executive
chairman Ian Murray said.

“We made an aggressive call to step out the drilling by 500m in the December drilling program and
shareholders have been rewarded with the highest-grade, broad gold interval drilled to date at
Gruyere (30m at 3.5 g/t).”
