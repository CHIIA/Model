Coal shines
Glencore Xstrata, the mining and trading company created in a $US29 billion deal last year,
increased copper production 24 per cent in the first quarter after expansions in Africa and Australia.
Output from its own mines was 382,000 tonnes in the three months to March 31, up from 307,700t a
year earlier. Coal output rose 4 per cent to 34.1 million tonnes, lower than expected, after a strike at
a mine in Colombia.

Forrest buys big

Andrew Forrest has come back into the market to show support for Fortescue Metals Group shares,
as they again dropped below $5 a share this week. Mr Forrest picked up 2 million Fortescue shares,
dropping a lazy $9.7 million in an on-market buy this week. The magnate has spent $17.1 million on
Fortescue shares since March.
Kengkong ups stake
A Hong Kong investor is set to increase his stake in VDM Group to 30 per cent under a $4.5 million
capital raising. VDM said Australia Kengkong Investments, controlled by Hiu Ming Luk, would provide
the unsecured loan for working capital next week. If shareholders approve conversion of the loan to
shares at 1¢ each, Kengkong’s VDM holding would rival that of managing director Dongyi Hua, whose
stake would fall to 30 per cent.
