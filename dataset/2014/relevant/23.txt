UDP SALE
UNITED Dairy Power founder Tony Esposito can't see why any supplier would leave now his
business is foreign owned.

``I don't see any negative in it other than the opportunity for farmers to receive more not less,'' he
said.

``I don't see why a supplier would leave because of overseas interests. If that is the case Fonterra,
Parmalat, National Foods (Lion), they all shouldn't have any milk.''
Mr Esposito confirmed he had sold UDP to Hong Kong private investor William Hui on Monday.

He said a letter would go out to UDP suppliers later this week informing them of the promised
farmgate milk price increase linked to the sale.
UDP suppliers will receive a bonus of 80c/kg butterfat and $1.20/kg protein on milk supplied during
October and November last year.
It is believed Mr Esposito sold the business for about $70 million, but he would not be drawn on
price.

In a supplier letter sent on Monday, new UDP chief executive Mark Smith and Mr Esposito described
new owner Mr Hui as ``a highly successful entrepreneur and businessman in Asia and the current
chairman of Singapore-listed Swing Media Technology Group Limited''.
Mr Esposito also said he would be ``stepping back'' from the business in the next few months ``but
will remain involved with UDP and committed to ensuring the business continues to flourish''.
On Monday Mr Smith told The Weekly Times the business wanted more milk, especially in South
Australia.

Mr Smith has worked with UDP as a consultant for the past three years, assisting with the acquisition
of its Jervois and Murray Bridge plants in South Australia and the recent sale.

He has previously held operational and finance roles with Fonterra and Bonlac.
Mr Smith said the new owner, Mr Hui, had no experience in the dairy industry and would not have a
hands-on role with UDP. He would be ``involved in the business as required''.

The UDP name and corporate identity will be unchanged, and no changes are expected to the
company's day-to-day operations, the company's statement said.
