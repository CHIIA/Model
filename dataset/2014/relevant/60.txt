Envestra renamed ENERGY: Gas distribution companyEnvestra has changed its name to Australian
Gas Networks following the recent move by Hong Kong conglomerate Cheung Kong Infrastructure to
take control of the company. CKI, which had a cornerstone stake in the company, trumped a rival bid
by APA Group. AGN plans to continue investing about $250 million a year in major projects, extending
its networks into new subdivisions, improving supply and replacing ageing gas mains across its
networks in South Australia, Victoria and Queensland.

Amcor confident PACKAGING: Amcor is expecting higher earnings in fiscal 2015, as the global
packaging manufacturer sees stable results in flexibles and positive sales in its rigid plastics after last
year’s spin-off of its Orora business. Managing director and chief executive Ken MacKenzie said: “The
company has had a solid start to the year and we remain confident of delivering increased earnings in
the 2015 financial year.”

Suncorp has it coveredBONDS: Suncorp Bank has priced its covered bond transaction, raising a total
$950 million in a deal that gained strong support from investors. The bank issued a five-year $250m
fixed-rate tranche and a $700m floating-rate tranche priced at mid swaps plus 70bps. The transaction
has been supported by strong domestic demand, domestic investors taking up 80 per cent of the bonds.
The issue had been taken up by 45 investors, including offshore players, with firm bids reaching over
$1.1 billion, the bank’s treasurer, Tim Hughes, said. The deal was the bank’s fourth covered-bond
transaction, following three previous ones in 2012. ANZ, Citi, Deutsche and UBS acted as the joint lead
managers in the deal, Suncorp said.
